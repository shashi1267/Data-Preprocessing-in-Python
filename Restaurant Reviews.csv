2011-03-16,5.0,"Round Rock, TX",El Pollo Rico Restaurant,"Best food I've had in the triangle for authentic Latin food. This rivals the pink taco truck back home. I can't say that in few days I've been here twice.I've been back so much, I need to just say that I see the same customers. This is a little known gem and needs the attention it deserves. soooo yummy!!!!THANK YOU!!!"
2011-06-29,4.0,"Wilmington, NC",El Pollo Rico Restaurant,This place is AWESOME. Just down home authentic Mexican/Central American food. I was in Raleigh for the day and just stumbled across this place. I ate with three Mexican friends and they all LOVED it. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic and delicious food. I signed up on yelp just to give this place a review.
2011-09-14,5.0,"Portland, OR",Seaboard Cafe,"I love this place. Definitely one of my favorite lunch spots in Raleigh on a nice day. Sure, it's a little overpriced. But they treat you like family and the food is consistently delicious.I love that they have fresh herbs to add to your lemonade or tea. I love the pickled carrots. I love that you sit outside in the middle of the best garden center in town. I love Rick!Their veggie sandwich is my favorite - I try to make it at home all the time. The grilled chicken sandwich is yummy. The potato and pasta salads never disappoint. The specials are always good. And let's not even talk about the tempting pastries at the checkout counter. I don't usually eat sweets, but damn! I think the charm and nomminess make it worth the wait in line and the extra couple bucks, for sure. Don't forget to tip your runner!"
2011-09-15,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Person Street Pharmacy,"Can't believe no one has reviewed this place yet.  Person Street Pharmacy has been around for decades and comes with a lunch counter.  The lunch counter has all the basics hamburgers, hotdogs, grilled cheese, and malts.  The usually run an all day special where you can get lunch for under $5.  Also they have the friendliest service imaginable.  Not to mention the chance to eat with all the locals.  Just in case you haven't eaten at a lunch counter before, be aware this isn't gourmet. Think stadium food only cleaner and a bit more variety."

2011-10-17,4.0,"Durham, NC",Seaboard Cafe,"I work near Seaboard Cafe and try to get there for lunch at least once every couple of weeks. The cafe is in a lovely setting inside a garden center (and contrary to what another reviewer said, most tables are inside; only a few are out). The veggie sandwich on sunflower is fabulous as are the different chicken salads. Tip: Sub the fruit salad for the chips. Table settings are rustic, befitting the location.  Rick and the wait staff are always welcoming. I have been going for years and have never had a bad experience."
2011-10-21,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Person Street Pharmacy,This is a great place if you want that good southern hospitality. Just if you are in a rush I wouldn't go during lunch.
2011-10-31,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Shish Kabob,"Man can not live by music alone so a stop by at Shish Kabob was a must-do during the Hopscotch music festival!  This small storefront was packed but the staff here is efficient.  I ordered up a chicken shwarma sandwich which was a tightly rolled up pita with chicken breast, lettuce and tomato, yum!  Great food to eat on the run, Shish serves up their wraps in tin foil so you just peel it off as you eat.  The sandwich was well put-together with plenty of grilled meat and veggies.  For a quick stop in, Shish Kabob does the job if you're in City Plaza.  Grab a seat outside, watch the people go by and enjoy a relaxed lunch here!"
2011-11-29,3.0,"Playa del Carmen, Cancún, Mexico",Seaboard Cafe,"Have lunch in a gardenVisits: Once in awhileR-Line Stop: R3If you have never been to Logan's Trading Company, the urban plant and flower nursery, then you may not know about little café located inside Logan's. Seaboard Café opened in 1991 and is hidden among the flowers at Logan's. There's only a small, unobtrusive sign next to the main entrance of Logan's advertising it's location and existence. On Saturday after working out at O2 Fitness Seaboard, my husband and I followed the heavenly, enticing scents wafting on the air to Seaboard Café. When you walk in the main entrance, go all the way to the back right of the building to find the café. Rick Perales, the owner, welcomed us with a big smile. He's a jovial, charismatic guy and he was happy to see us even though he didn't know us. But he did know many of the other patrons and it was apparent that the customers really liked him. I asked Rick about the tortilla soup. He explained that is was made from tomatoes, onions, broth, a little pepper and some cumin. Yes, as advertised, menu items are fresh and made from scratch daily. Awesome! Rick took our order just before we reached the cash register. I selected the soup and salad combination. Andy ordered the same thing and added on some Cross-Tie (waffle-like) fries. All the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. As I was getting a cup of water, I noticed the bowl of sliced lemons and another bowl of fresh mint next to the tea station. Wow, that's special! I added a lemon slice and a sprig of mint to my water...yum and it felt fancy. I like the little things. Since the weather was so pleasant, we picked a table outside. There were beautiful, blooming camillas close to our table and rows of flowering fall shrubs and annuals all around. Such a lovely spot. After a short wait, our meals were served. It's very casual at the café with paper plates and cups and plastic utensils. The soup was steaming hot which would be great on a cold day. Note to self: get hot soup at Seaboard Café this winter. The soup had good flavor and I liked the crunchy tortilla strips on top. For me the addition of a shake of salt made the soup perfect. I ordered the Greek salad but this salad was a loose interpretation of a Greek salad in that the olives were black olives but not kalamatas and the dressing was a light vinaigrette that was pinkish in color since it was made with red wine vinegar. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining. I'm just saying it was different from what I expected. I enjoyed the crisp, fresh salad and the light dressing was a healthier option than the normal heavy olive oil greek dressing. Andy gobbled up his soup and salad but he needed the order of waffle fries to fill him up. On a previous visit, I had the Turkey Club on Whole Wheat, which was a scrumptious sandwich with thinly sliced, lean turkey, two crisp strips of bacon, on toasted wheat bread. I also tried the pickled carrots, a signature side at Seaboard Café.Seaboard Café serves a delicious lunch in a garden setting in downtown Raleigh. Discover this hidden gem."
2012-01-02,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Seaboard Cafe,"The Cafe is tucked behind the Garden shop. Remember, it is a garden shop, not a boutique hotel. It is a rough and ready place in a roll your sleeves up and let's get some dirt under your fingers Garden Shop. The cafe somewhat hides behind the Garden shop, which has an affinity for Christmas, so be aware of the many decorated trees as you swing in. Or you will be paying for more than your lunch.I love looking at the expertly decorated trees, and have often just admired the ornaments  without purchasing until I learned this year (after many years of gawping) that you can buy OFF of the tree. But I still feel guilty ruining the decorations.On to the cafe....The ambianceThe decor is forgivable, but not necessarily at first sight. Plastic garden chairs (albeit, the nice high backed ones) and basic tables. Look around though, and there are decorations ""borrowed"" or themed from the garden shop. LIke everything here, the decorations kind of chameleon into the walls and windows making the feel shabby chic. Not unclean, just a kind of comfortable clutter. Sit still and let your eyes linger. You'll find some creativity here.The food.I have eaten here twice for lunch.Once was a light soup and half sandwich.Very filling and honestly made.The muffin was not a steroid induced Arnie swartznegger gargantuan muffin filled with fakeness. It was normal sized and filled with imaginative flavors. I believe it was savory.I had soup of the day. No need to tell you what it was as it would be different the next time. But trust me. It was nice.The serviceThe first time, I was greeted by a very jocular man, who had a slight accent. It seemed as though he was/is the manager/owner of Seaboard Cafe. It seems to me, that this charming man has done a vulcan mind meld on his fellow co-workers as the ""friendly"" seems to be sucked right out of them and he is the only one with the bright smile and the jolly demeanor. The great thing, is that he genuinely means it. The rest of the staff slog around wiping tables and serving as though they can't wait for you to leave. The difference in his attitude and the attitude of his staff is day and night.My second visit yielded the same appearance of high gratitude and zest for life from the manager/owner and very little other than grumpiness from his staff. You smile, they grunt. You smile, they frown. Why go then?The food, for the price, is well made, honest and delicious. A great place for lunch when you are famished after a hard mornings work of planning your garden and picking up supplies."
2012-02-17,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Cafe Tiramisu,"Finally made it here, and finally got to use the Groupon I'd bought a long time ago.  Armed with $60 of credit that I'd paid $30 for, we ventured forth via the 6:30 reservation I made earlier this afternoon.  After a very tough work week, both of us were truly in need of a real meal.  And Cafe Tiramisu gave us not only a real meal, but a really GOOD real meal!   May I just say that I hope you appreciate the food porn, as this is not the easiest setting to get such?  This is a TINY (capacity 49) restaurant.  You need a reservation!  You also need to know you will be close to folks around you (husband got bumped badly repeatedly with a table sitting nearby), and you will have to squeeze by folks to get to a rest room.  That being said, you can also look at is as COZY.  So, I can now understand why there are only a couple food porn pics for this place so far, and why you should really appreciate the ones I am now posting.    Server:  Richard...awesome!  Friendly, knowledgeable, sense of humor...loved him!  Having perused the menu online before going, I had some idea of what I would be ordering, but Richard changed that by reciting daily specials.  We started with the special oyster appetizer:  fried oysters with a light lemon cream sauce.  It was 6 perfectly fried succulent oysters that were light and delicate with just a touch of sauce so they were rich, but not overly so.  Husband said he'd give them 6 stars.  Before that, the BREAD.  Seriously some of the best bread I've ever had.  So light, yet crusty and flaky.  How did they do that?  (I asked, you're welcome) Neomonde.  Ahhh, that makes perfect sense.  And the dipping oil was so fresh and flavorful.  It was green, yet didn't taste like basil.  Parsley?  If so, a very flavorful parsley.     We shared a Caeser salad next.  This would be our only mild disappointment of the night.  Kudos for them dividing it for us on separate plates, but while the lettuce was nice and green and cool, it was mostly devoid of flavor.  Very light dressing, croutons uninspiring and no detectable parmesan.  No biggee, just won't do that again here.  By the way, chardonnay lovers...Sonoma Cutrer for $8.95 a glass.  'nuff said.  For our mains, Husband went with the veal parmesan.  I opted for the special of the day (without asking how much...armed with Groupons one can be brave, ya know?):  it was a large shrimp baked in garlic special with spinach fettucine and a white clam sauce. Sold!  (price unknown, care to guess?)   Both entrees were very very good.  We would give them each 4-stars.  Husband thought his veal parmesan was excellent, but the pasta part just okay (he's used to mine, sorry Cafe Tiramisu...but I don't cook veal, so he could really appreciate that).  My meal was very good also...three giant shrimp, two of which were good, and one was outstanding, loved the homemade pasta cooked to perfect al dente, and the white clam sauce was perfect.  Clams were not in their shells, but that was a plus as they didn't get in the way, and were so TENDER (rare for clams)  and fresh-tasting.  It was the perfect amount of food.  Not too crazy big, yet filling.  We tried hard to be brave and not lick plates.  Dessert: Hearing the folks behind me talk about a dessert drink, I had to order one.  It was an espresso one, with vanilla liquor and all kinds of creamy rich delicious goodness.  Husband had the tiramisu which might just be his all time fave, and he's a tiramisu expert.  I tasted it and have to agree, it was excellent.  Atmosphere is very happy.  People are laughing, and having a good time.  You see great looking food on other tables, and the smells are amazing.  Small,  Intimate and very recommended.  Just make reservations or you won't get in, cause it is SMALL.   So, did you guess how much?  (neither did I)  Drumroll, please....  My special-I-don't-care-how-much-entree turned out to be $22.95.  Value for experience...INvaluable...and just what I needed after an especially tough week at work."
2012-03-08,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Cafe Tiramisu,"My husband and I went to Cafe Tiramisu for the first time on Valentine's Day and I have to say, I wasn't all that impressed. While the food was tasty, the entrees were overpriced and the customer service was lacking. As such, I rate this restaurant with 2 stars because, meh, I've experienced better."
2012-03-11,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Cafe Tiramisu,"Our friends had been talking about Café Tiramisu for quite a while and yesterday we finally went with them. Reservations are mandatory on a Saturday night - I called Friday and my choices were 6pm and after 9:30... so we picked 6pm.When we arrived it was obvious why reservations were hard to come by - this place is tiny. Maybe 12 tables (I didn't count though). There's a nice bar, too.We were seated promptly and dove into the menu - quite a good selection of Italian favorites. I ordered Carpaccio (always a must in a new Italian place for me) for my appetizer. It was good. Other folks on my table had the Lobster Bisque - very good - and a Salad. For the main course I got the Osso Buco which came highly recommended by our friends. It came with Spinach Fettucini and was good but for my taste needed just a little bit of salt added. Other folks had the Mahi Mahi special (good but the risotto that came with the fish was too rich for our friend's taste) and the Mussels (good, too, in a really good sauce).For dessert I got a Canneloni (about the usual) while our friends had the Tiramisu (highly recommended) and the Mango Sorbet (best part of our friend's meal according to her).The wine list is extensive with a really good selection throughout all price regions. Lots of affordable bottles of wine but also some available to splurge on if you so desire.Service was good - our waiter was attentive and always there when we needed him.Would I go back? Sure! Did it make my list of must eat at places? Not quite."
2012-04-05,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",El Pollo Rico Restaurant,"I've been back to El Pollo Rico twice in the last two days. Wow, their food is even better. Previously, their pupusas were somewhat lacking. They have stepped up their game and they are some seriously delicious eats. I had pork and cheese pupusas on both days. Today, I also had the plantanos fritos, sweet plantains, savory refried beans and crema. So friggin' good. My husband had the carne asada plate and really enjoyed it. The price is right and the food is satisfying. This place is still a winner."

2012-05-10,4.0,"Morrisville, NC",Wade Park Cafe,"If you are looking for one of those hidden gems to have a good sammich at, this place is your spot. Not sure how I found out about this cafe, but while doing errands around Raleigh I decided to duck in and find it. It is way back in an office complex building on Wade Park Blvd off Edwards Mill Rd, near Cardinal Gibbons High School area. If you didn't know it was there, you'd never look for it!There is a corner entrance so you don't have to go into the (very very nice) office building itself. It is a very modest, simple place but decorated nicely, see the pics I managed to nab. You order at the counter and the staff bring it out with your name as the identifer on the order. Their goods range from sandwiches and paninis, salads and soups, and even breakfast if you catch them early enough.  There are daily specials as well. As I stopped in on a Wednesday, I chose the Super Reuben daily special with corned beef and turkey with a side of chips. It was great, it is rarely that a sandwich satisfies me for a meal but this one did the trick, and pretty tasty to boot. They have a large assortment of drink options, from self serve fountain drinks to a self serve fridge of fruit juices and drinks and other assorted beverages. I got a Berkley & Jensen Mandarin Orange Sparking Water Beverage in a 20 oz bottle, delish...I'm going to remember that one. The staff were busy with their duties but nice and attentive on my visit. Catch 'em early though, because they are only open until 230pm. Nice for the office staff in this complex to get a good lunch.Bottom line: Great hidden gem for a good sammich. Lots of choices. Modest cafe but clean and nice, with good staff. There is even a nice park opposite the building so if you want to go outside and eat, you can enjoy (water fountain, sculpture art, benches, and all). I think these guys are going to see me again."
2012-05-29,4.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Wade Park Cafe,"Wow! This little place is amazing! I rushed in before 2:30 and was pleasantly surprised with the results. I had recently spotted a groupon for the cafe and decided to try it out. The staff members were very pleasant and helpful. I decided to order the Chicken Salad Club with chips and the Italian Panni with fruit, and despite the fact that they both tasted amazing, there was no way I could eat soooo much food! The fruit was fresh and tasted so sweet! The sandwiches were wonderful for a hot afternoon. And, trust me, you definitely get your money's worth of food for the price! I will definitely be going back to this cafe during the summer."
2012-06-05,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Seaboard Cafe,"When my mom came to visit, I was excited to try out this cafe with her-- she loves working in her garden, so I figured a cafe in a garden shop was a no brainer! We came on a Friday around 12 and the line was already curved around the corner. The staff must be used to this-- there was a guy taking orders about halfway down the line, so that once we got to the register we could just pay instead of gawking at the menu. So when I finally took a look at the menu, I was a little surprised to see nothing that really struck my fancy-- there were a lot of mayo heavy dishes which I stay away from and chicken salad seems to be their main event. I ended up selecting the grilled chicken sandwich with a peach-pepper relish, my mom got the apricot chicken salad du jour on a croissant and my boyfriend got the burger and fries. Hands down, my favorite thing about this place was the fact that you could put fresh mint and lemons in your tea. Other than that, the food was fair, but nothing special. My sandwich was fairly bland (I had to ask for a side of mustard since the relish barely tasted like anything) and the chicken breast hadn't been pounded flat, making the sandwich a little cumbersome to eat. My mom loved her chicken salad croissant, however, and Andrew had no complaints about his burger.I'm glad we got to try it out and the location really is lovely...next time you're in Seaboard Station on a pretty day and are looking for a casual, unique spot to catch a bite, give this place a try! Just make sure your date isn't mayo-adverse ;)"
2012-06-07,2.0,"Durham, NC",Manhattan Cafe,"Had to be in Raleigh for a few hours yesterday, so on the way back to the parking garage I started looking for a place for a late lunch.  Spotted the Manhattan Cafe across the street and wandered over.  Had one of the best cheeseburgers with fries ever!  The burger was just right and had lots of cheese melted on top.  The fries were hot and crisp.  They even had Cheerwine in the drink dispenser.  They had a lot of other offerings like salads and a wide selection of sandwiches, but I'm not sure I can get past the burger here.  Service was friendly and efficient and the place was clean."

2012-07-01,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Got to Be NC Competition Dining,"An awesome cooking and dining experience, the Fire in the Triangle series will hopefully become a yearly occurrence.  Hit up the Sono vs. Flights competition last week and all I can say is that it's a first class event.  From the choice of the 1705 Prime Chophouse to the production of the competition, a fun and well organized eating-fest!  We came in early for a couple of cocktails at the lounge, most everyone was dressed up for a high-end dining experience sporting business casual and cocktail wear.  As we moved into the dining room to our assigned tables, the staff is making sure all your needs are well taken care of from a beverage standpoint.  TV's line the room showing off the chef teams and adverts for Got to Be NC who sponsors the event.  The emcee Jimmy Crippen gets the excitement and your appetite going as you prepare to be led down a high-end feasting trail.  You've got six smallish courses to go through and you have no idea who cooked what, the description of each dish is flashed on the screen and voting is done through paper ballot or your smartphone using a QR code.And tonight's special/secret ingredient is noodle, happy day for me but not a great choice for my gluten-free friend, Gina B.  Over the course of the night we tried a lobster dumpling, smoked duck, braised pork with collards and fried noodle roll, a shrimp roll over lemon cream sauce and finally, a blackberry cake with pistachio cigarette.  All very well done, especially under the tight timing and circumstances.  At the end of the evening, the teams are introduced to the dining public as the votes are tabulated...  And the winner is, FLIGHTS which kicked so much culinary butt with its blackberry cake.  The voting was tight, Sono probably missed the boat without a sweet and happy ending.  In the end the real winners were anyone and everyone who was here at the event because it was awesome.  And for those of you who have tickets to the final event, I am totally envious of y'all.  Because I guarantee you, it's going to be an amazing culinary and dining experience.  No doubt..."
2012-07-06,5.0,"Cary, NC",Wade Park Cafe,"We had heard about this place from a friend.  We work about a 7-8 minute drive from here so decided to try it out today.  The woman running the place was very helpful and patient as we read through the menu at the counter to decide.  She offered suggestions as well.I had the Italian panini and my coworker had a half sandwich/half salad combo.  He got roast beef & horseradish.  Both sandwiches were very good and had plenty of meat and other items on them.   His salad was large and had a fresh variety of lettuce and other vegetables in it.  I chose half fruit and half chips for my included side.  The fruit was very good and fresh.  Next time, I'll get all fruit.There are several items on the menu that I'd like to try so we'll be back.Overall, great sandwiches and fresh salads.  Go for the half sandwich/half salad combo for best value and variety!  They are only open from 10:30-2:30."

2012-07-17,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Got to Be NC Competition Dining,"Fire in the Triangle is a fantastic event! I went to last night's Heron's vs 518 West showdown, where corn was the secret ingredient. It was even better than I had hoped. First class experience. My only disappointment is I don't have tickets to the remaining Triangle challenges. Seriously contemplating the 3 hour round trip to Greensboro for ""Fire in the Triad"" in Aug/Sept. Rumor has it, the final 4 winners from Fire on the Rock, on the Dock, in the Triangle and in the Triad will face off. Count me in if that happens!"

2012-08-01,4.0,"Durham, NC",Got to Be NC Competition Dining,"4.5 stars for the finale event; but I'm rounding up given the novelty of this series, and it's inaugural appearance in the Triangle. I can tell you I'm certainly looking forward to next year; and also strongly considering attending one of the Triad competitions.Firstly, the logistics; and then the food.. So much about this contest has been fine-tuned (over years past, held in other NC regions) that, for the most part, it runs really smoothly! The few things that bothered me were that when I purchased tickets online, I didn't receive an email confirmation; similarly, there was no reminder email with date/time/dress code/location, so you had to search for that info on the website. We also didn't start on time, since a few folks were stuck in accident traffic on 40. It was nice of the host to wait for them, and we had bread at the table in the meantime. Everything else was handled pretty perfectly -- from check-in, to video production, to soundtracks (think Rocky theme songs, complete with training montages!). Also the voting app is fab, and real-time results are immediate!1705 Prime is a great location for this event. The bar and lounge make a nice cocktail hour before seating time. The dining room is comfortable with tables seating six. And the staff was efficient with clearing plates and getting drinks. However, they bussed my silverware with each plate and failed to bring new utensils. On my third course, I asked if I could get a new fork, and the gal delivering my plate told me it was a ""spoon dish."" It was pork shoulder. I attempted to eat it with a spoon, but had to give up; flagged another server who brought me a fork and knife. After that course was over, the server seemed to take notice of our table's depleting utensils and took care of replenishing them before needed. The food... the finale was between Herons and Weathervane. I was really excited about the match-up. Then we learned that there would be not one, but two secret ingredients: chocolate and grits. These are tough ingredients! And many of the dishes produced had pronounced chocolate and a not-so-creative use of grits, so that our table-mates actually grew verbally weary of the cuisine. Surprising too, there was no use of vegetables! So the first four courses were all meat and grits. I did enjoy taking in the many facets of each plate (the aroma, presentation, use of secret ingredient, and so on). And was certainly impressed with some of the offerings, and full after finishing them all. Although for the finale, I think frankly, I was expecting a bit more pizzazz. Standouts for me were the housemade sausage, served with grits and crumbled cheese. Also the petit filet, with white chocolate-sweetened grits and a plate dotted with a citrus syrup. Couldn't taste the supposed cocoa rub on the filet, but the other flavors came across beautifully. All in all, I truly enjoyed myself, and found it to be a unique and engaging experience. One that I would definitely repeat! Not knowing the secret ingredient or -- in the final rounds -- the competing chefs at your point of purchase, really only makes the Russian Roulette of it all more exciting."
2012-08-01,5.0,"Phoenix, AZ",Got to Be NC Competition Dining,"If you love food, and all of the shows on TV about food, this is the event to attend in the Triangle. When the best compete with unknown ingredients, they get to face off in a challenge that you help decide the winner of.We decided to try the final battle between Herrons and the Weathervane. Secret ingredients were ""grits and chocolate"". A six course meal followed where you used your smart phone to judge such things as appearance, aroma, taste, etc.What fun for a true foodie! Lots of discussions at each table and it was very interesting to compare notes with people eating the same thing. I truly believe we will attend something like this again.This is a well put together event, and a truly unique experience to our area.The winner I won't reveal (Look it up!) received a red chef jacket and a $2000 check and of course bragging rights.I believe there is going to be an upcoming one in Greensboro for that area, if you missed this event.Plan on a special and fun night, bring friends and family, taste, discuss and vote!"
2012-10-02,5.0,"Durham, NC",Brookside Market & Deli,"The convenience of this place is undeniable. Odd location, but yet in a spot where there really isn't a lot around. Other than neighborhoods. So I love to pop in here and grab that last minute item I forgot on the way home. However, what truly makes me a fan of this food is the awesome food they serve. I've lost count of how many Chicken Shawarmas I've had from here! They have an impressive assortment of Mediterranean foods that they cook up fresh for you and it's delicious. My recommendation is of course the Chicken Shawarma, but also try the Baba Ganoush. REALLY good.The one downside is the stuff in that cooler next to the kitchen area where they usually have the cheesecakes and stuff. Last time I was in there, I got a piece of cheesecake and there was something really wrong with it. I think it was cooling properly. The cheesecake was lukewarm. Other than that, everything was great"
2012-10-14,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Brookside Market & Deli,"So I'm still watching my Blu-ray ""Marvel's The Avengers,"" so yes I'm still on my shawarma kick, and so was my brother. So before we headed over to Cooke street, I made a quick stop at Brookside Deli.The price is decent here, and place is sparkling clean. The tables are a bit small, especially when one orders and eats the way I do, but tables and chairs are covered and maintain cleanliness.I chosed stuffed grape leaves, hummus, and baba ghanouj for the Mediterranean Sampler. I love stuffed grape leaves, and these are wrapped smaller; I think the cold ones can be much better with a bit more oil. Hummus was good. Baba ghanouj has a strong smokey flavor, unlike any I've taste before, so that's new.Brookside use thicker flour pita, not the pocket kind, so the shawarma is more like a gyro, which is just as good. Both chicken and beef/lamb variety are good.P.S. I kinda was hoping to see the meat spit. Not sure why I'm always so interested in those things.The (co-?)owner is a really nice dude.

I'd popped in to ask about the nearest bank (way too far!) on the way to buy hopscotch tix nearby, and settled with their ATM since I was on a time crunch. The owners are super laidback/friendly and after hearing I was new to the area, they sat me down, made me a plate and treated me to a taste of everything!!They've got an impressive menu (with all the traditional american market deli food as well - not that i've  ever  had a reason to migrate away from the fallafel) I've been salivating over their chicken shawarma, and fresh hummus ever since - and I mean FRESH as in they boil down the chickpeas themselves... everything's made in house.  The Baba ganoush was amazing , great tabouli, and with really fresh hot pita....... I take my out of towners there now too and never left without a few  ""i need to live next door to this"" comments.  Also, the whole market was really clean, organized, and fully stocked to the point i avoided the grocery store another week after my little pit stop :) Pretty sure they had free wi-fi too.........Enjoy!"
2012-11-20,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bloomsbury Bistro,"Went here for our anniversary dinner and had one of the best meals we've ever had in the Triangle. Everything was delicious from appetizer to wine to dessert, along with a very friendly and helpful waitstaff.  I love the changing, seasonal menu as well. My venison was cooked perfectly and paired with delicious veggies. The atmosphere is not the best, as our table for 2 was very close to the other 2 person tables, but we still felt like we could talk without being infringed on or infringing on our neighbors.  In short, if you're looking for a splurge I would highly recommend Bloomsbury Bistro."

2013-01-27,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Lee’s Kitchen,"I have not had anything here that was not excellent.  Chicken dishes are stocked full with chicken including lots of white meat chicken, rather than skin, bones and gristle which you see with other places.  Oxtails are super tender and flavorful (I didn't eat oxtails before Lee's Kitchen!).  Collard greens and cornbread just so good and flavorful.  I can't get enough Lee's.  And there is now a 2nd location with seating.Dishes generally come with rice and beans/peas or cabbage.  I recommend the dinner portion, I've never had the lunch portion and as good as it is, I'd prefer dinner portions and having leftovers (however I usually eat it all)"
2013-02-16,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Brookside Market & Deli,"Thursday night is Indian night. Make it happen in your life, because homestyle Indian food is a rare find outside of the Cary/Morrisville area. It comes with everything you need in a meal for around $8; bring your appetite, though, because portions are generous.The rest of the week, you can find delicious Mediterranean food that also combines affordability, freshness and tastiness in one package. The deli can get busy in the afternoon; I've stopped by to grab a quick lunch only to find a line, but don't let that thwart you! There isn't a line because of slow or inattentive staff - quite the opposite! - but because the food is fresh and each serving is prepared to order. The convenience store itself is nicer than average, clean, and a useful addition to the neighbourhood; the deli is an absolute blessing. Don't be put off by the bland exterior, because it hides a small business gem!"
2013-02-17,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Lee’s Kitchen,"I absolutely adore this place of Caribbean Goodness.  I have had the jerk chicken, curry chicken, brown stewed chicken (MY ABSOLUTE FAVE!!!), cabbage, rice and peas, white rice, greens, mac and cheese and various slices of cakes.  Before Lee's I had never had brown stewed chicken, now it is my favorite dish to order at ANY Caribbean restaurant.  Unfortunately, no one can touch LK's version.  Fortunately, it keep me coming back to Lee.  LOL.  I will say the female staff can be extremely rude.  I actually have snapped back when they snap first because there is no way that anyone in a service position should be speaking to a customer like that.  The male staff (Including Lee) are absolutely personable, charming and accommodating.   The price point is a little high but the food is fresh and good.  One time they royally screwed up my catering order and this is when I had to snap back at the rude female employee who could have cared less my party was in less than an hour and she refused to make the dish.  It was a mess.  Overall, I give LK's a 4 star.  Would have been a 5 if the customer service was up to par."
2013-02-27,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bloomsbury Bistro,GREAT FOOD! This is such a wonderful restaurant. The menu is always changing and always fresh. If you are looking for a great dinner this is the place to go.

Fast service and great Mediterranean options - kabobs, salads, gyros, hummus... I ordered a chicken kabob served with a Greek salad.

2013-03-17,5.0,"Durham, NC",Lee’s Kitchen,"I absolutely LOVE this place!!!! There is nothing that I haven't tried that doesn't make me want to go back for more and more and more!!! I love it sooooo much that I was on my way to pickup my order one day and I got in a minor car accident (I wasn't at fault :) and afterwards even with my little headache and hurt knee I went to get my togo order!First let me tell you a little bit about the place. The restaurant serves authentic Jamaican and Soul food. So you can get curry chicken and collards, or plantains and smothered pork chops.  :) The restaurant is carryout only and you should definitely call ahead to place your order because sometimes its a little hectic in there (people love this place)!I'm a big fan of the collards, no seasoning needed!  I normally go somewhere and have to add vinegar or something to my collards to make them taste better but these can be eaten without any self add-ons. The macaroni is sooooo good, Idk what they do to it but its unique and yummy. The curry chicken is definitely amazing! I normally dont eat onions but the curry is soooo good I refuse to pick thru it! The prices here are amazing. You can get a side meat of curry chicken (or other meats) for $5 and it comes with rice and peas or plain white rice! And its enough to get full off of. Sides come with most of the meals and you can also buy them individually for I think $3 and you get a HUGE portion.Just to name some items they have on the menu... Pork Chops (done several ways), chicken, fish, curry chicken, jerk chicken, brownstew chicken, cabbage, collards, macaroni.....I highly recommend this place for anyone who is looking for a nice Jamaican meal or soul food. I could eat here everyday!!!!"
2013-03-18,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Cafe Tiramisu,"Love. Love. Love this place! We made reservations only 30 minutes in advance on a Saturday and were seated immediately upon arrival. The wine was great. The bread and dipping oil was great. They altered my entree to make it dairy free, which was phenomenal. I had the shrimp and sausage rigatoni. It was supposed to be a cream sauce , and they did just a tomato base for me. Initially, they put parmesan on top, but they took it back to fix it immediately. It was deliciously spicy! My Mom had Paul's meatballs which I had in the past before my dairy allergy diagnosis. They are the best! This is my favorite Italian restaurant in the area. If I could secure a boyfriend, I'd be here all the time for date nights!! I did think the waiter (not mine) Dan was super cute, but I'm sure he's taken!!"

2013-03-27,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Manhattan Cafe,"Manhattan Cafe is setup with two stations where you can pick your own ingredients to create your own Pasta or Salads. They also have a pre-made sandwich cooler. I have been to Manhattan Cafe three times for lunch as I work in the downtown area.The first time I went to the pasta section. I ordered a wheat pasta (which is extra charge) and all of my other ingredients. All of the items are cooked infront of you. As i was served my pasta (with alfredo sauce, mushrooms, grilled chicken, and some other spices) I found the pasta to actually be a little on the cold side and the alfredo sauce far too greasy. Bad first experience.I returned a second time for the sandwich section. Their, I ordered a pressed panini and it was satisfactory. You can't really expect more from a pre-made sandwich that was pressed in a toasted.Third, I returned for the salad section. If it wasnt for their salad options, the rating would be a one star. Their options are plentiful and their sauces vary from savory to sweet, and with many low fat/calorie options.From now on, the only thing that I eat there are the salads."

I could not say a bad thing about this place. For me it starts with customer service, and there is plenty to go around. The food, I believe I have attempted everything on the menu and the Chicken Salad Sandwich is to die for. Moist, tasteful, and filling. The price is about 8-10 for a lunch, its worth about 15. I love this place and it will always be my favorite place in the Raleigh area for a nice lunch."

Wonderful wine list.  And those are only four items, I could go on and on.  All this for a reasonable price with a restaurant that hasn't rested on their laurels.  It is a fine example of Northern Italian fare.  Fresh, local ingredients with flair and the portions were very ample.The Lobster bisque was perfect as was the veal piccata.  The gnocchi were homemade and (potato) not semolina.  There is a difference!I would give them 10 stars if I could.  We look forward to going back on a nice afternoon to enjoy the small, pretty patio.Thank goodness for Cafe Tiramisu.  Raleigh should be proud."
2013-04-16,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Seaboard Cafe,"Really a lovely place for a lighter lunch, with delicious sandwiches, salads, sides, and friendly employees.  Inside Logans, you'll find this gem of a lunch place.  Great for a casual meet-up with friends for a fresh bite to eat.  I've been happy with everything that I've gotten here.  They have chicken salads featured and the pistachio is my favorite as of right now.  Price is fine for lunch, at under $10.  My 5 star reviews are usually quite short because you only need to know that you should go to this restaurant.  Enjoy!"
2013-05-02,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bloomsbury Bistro,"5 of 5 stars (excellent, fine dining)(see explanation of ratings below)Always a fave of ours.  We buy $500 worth of gift certificates each year (for $400) and give them to ourselves!Chef Toler is amazingly creatively and he changes his menu about every six weeks.Allow 60-90 minutes.Cost: about $25-$35 for food alone.$15 corkage fee.About my ratings:Only fine dining establishments can garner five stars.  Until yelp realizes that a fast food joint cannot possibly be ranked equally with a $100 per person place, I need to draw the line somewhere.  If we were only talking about the quality and presentation of the food, it would be a different story.  But, as we know, yelp's rankings take into account the entire dining experience.Therefore, I divide restaurants into three categories (and I wish yelp would do the same):1) fast food and ""fast-casual"" (no table service )2) casual and ""polished casual"" dining (table service)3) fine dining (linen napkins, no plastic cups, no TV's in dining room, typically more expensive than casual dining)Fine dining can earn a max of five stars.  Casual dining can earn a max of four stars.  Fast food can earn a max of three stars."
2013-05-14,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Seaboard Cafe,"SUCH a huge fan of this place.  It meets all my most important requirements for a lunch destination.  Firstly, it's in Logan's and you absolutely cannot walk through that place on an even moderately nice day and not feel happy.  Then go into the cafe and there's lots of natural light and plenty of both indoor and outdoor seating.  The man who owns this place always has the most warm, sunny smile.  The food is always really, really consistent and very good.  My husband loves their burgers.  I always get the Veggie Sandwich.  They also have some really good chicken salad sandwich offerings.  The only thing I can't say I'm wild about is the pasta salad, but it seems that pasta salad is something that many restaurants miss on. In any event, this place is one my favorites in Raleigh and I go there almost every week."
2013-06-01,3.0,"Durham, NC",Seaboard Cafe,"Seaboard Cafe is one of my favorite lunch spots in downtown Raleigh. It's a good place to enjoy a casual, delicious lunch outdoors when the weather is nice!Parking is easy since there are plenty of spaces available in the Seaboard Station shopping center. The cafe is located in the back of Logan's Trading Co. which creates a natural aesthetic as you enjoy your meal amongst the plants and garden decor. There is a lot of natural light, a cool breeze and plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.You may have to wait in a line during normal lunchtime hours, but the line moves quickly and during the rush there is often a staff member taking orders to help the process move along more quickly. After placing and paying for your order at the counter with the owner who is always welcoming and kind, you can move down the line where you can put fresh mint and lemons in your tea.I have never actually ordered off of the regular menu because I am always please with the daily specials. Most recently I ordered a baked crab cake sandwich that came with a side of shrimp seafood macaroni salad and a pickle spear.Next time you're in the area on a nice day and looking for a new lunch spot casual, give this place a try!"

2013-07-04,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Donatos Raleigh,"It's always great to find new places to eat at Seaboard Station!Having gone to Peace College I have seen the evolution of Seaboard through the years which makes me so happy that there are so many new places to eat here. The newest offering at the shopping center is Donatos, which specializes in thin crust pizza with crust to crust toppings. The menu also includes a few salads, some bread items, and hot sandwiches. I came in around 8pm with a coupon for a free large pizza (join their email club for yours!). My friend and I also ordered some boneless garlic wings. After about a 20 minute wait we were presented with our order and headed home to eat. It's possible to eat in as well but the tables are very small and a pizza that big would have taken up too much space. The pizza was very big and cut into many small rectangles. The crust was crunchy and the pepperoni was very good as well.The wings were pretty underwhelming. They weren't terrible but the girl forgot our sauces that apparently come free, and the wings were more like small nuggets with some garlic on them. I've head much better and probably wont try these again. Over all I was pleased, and hopefully Donatos does well in it's new location!"
2013-07-04,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Donatos Raleigh,"Now, I am a die hard Lillys Pizza fan, and I am not the biggest thin crust fan....however I was pleasently surprised by how overall tasty the pizza was.  It was Crispy, plenty of pepperoni, and Saucy which wasnt a characteristic I knew I even wanted in a pizza.  The flavors reminded me of a hearty slice of new york pizza without mess.  My only overall complain was how small the wings are; they had a great flavor but you definatly have to over a ton to make it count (6 isnt going to do it if you wanna share).  Overall its a okay substitution if you just don't have the time or energy for the lillys wait.xoxo"
2013-07-11,2.0,"Carrboro, NC",Seaboard Cafe,"Although tucked away and slightly hidden, Seaboard Cafe is a cute, casual lunch spot. It's behind an interesting store that sells a hodgepodge of things and surrounded by plants and flowers with tons of outdoor seating. You order at the register, find a seat, and someone will bring you your food. I think the owner was behind the counter during my visit; and he was so cheery and helpful. I had their veggie sandwich (no mayo, added some avocado) on rye, and it is hands down the best vegetable sandwich I've bought/eaten. I say ""best vegetable sandwich"" because it is packed full of fresh, delicious veggies and cheese. I chose not to put any sauce in it, but the flavors were fantastic on its own. It's like my perfect summer sandwich! They also have different sides you can choose from to accompany your entree. I like how I can tell that they really do cook (and bake) their own food. It's their own recipes and ingredients and creations. AND it's not just your typical sandwich cafe. It's got its own flare.Aw man, now I'm craving that sandwich again..."

I was super impressed and will definitely re-visit this iconic burger place again when in Raleigh!  My five-star review is in comparison to similar type dive-y places.  Although, I have to say the experience this Char-Grill provides (from the quirky ordering process to the last delicious bite) is really one of a kind!"

2013-08-14,5.0,"Apex, NC",Got to Be NC Competition Dining,"We attended one of the semi-final rounds for Fire in the Triangle 2013, which pitted Market against Midtown. The secret ingredients were pork and elderberries - score!!! I was a little worried when I saw the one that had Krispy Kreme donuts and coffee, but there was a lot of cheering when the ingredients were announced last night. 1705 Prime is a great location for the event, although the bar area got really crowded before dinner and even though there were 4 bartenders, they had a hard time keeping up. I was disappointed that there was no champagne available in the bar, but at least they had a full bar. The wine selections for the evening were also very limited which was a little disappointing. The dining room was set up very nicely and the servers that we had were fantastic. We tried to get our server to spill on the secret ingredients but she was very tight lipped other than saying she thought we'd be happy. Apparently they had a leak in one of the early rounds and it wasn't well received!The food was fabulous. The only thing I didn't really like was the sweet potato cinnabon. It sounded like it would be awesome, but it was just too thick and dense. The standout dish of the night was a pork bolognese with country ham gnocchi and a poached egg on top! YUM. The first runner up was pork belly with an elderberry BBQ sauce, peanut sauce and crispy prosciutto on top. Both of those were prepared by the chef from Midtown who won the competition.  My main complaint was that the em-ceeing was too much. There was a ton of advertising and just a lot of chatter that wasn't needed. Over all though, this was a really fun event and I will go again."

The chicken was not done very well at all as it tasted very processed. The peach pepper relish that comes on it was disappointing; very little flavor. And I definitely could have done a better balsamic pasta salad...it was unecessarily DRENCHED in the dressing. Nice enough"
2013-09-07,5.0,"Chelsea, MA",El Pollo Rico Restaurant,A store/restaurant that offers a wide variety of Central American food and a good selection of beer.

2013-09-12,4.0,"Carrboro, NC",Tijuana Flats,"Whoa. Dare I say it? YES, my new favorite fast Tex-Mex place that is thankfully like 4 minutes away from my new house. I've been wanting to try this place out because I've heard of their hot sauce bar & their website looks funky cool. By the way, the decor is so vibrant and eclectic and hip (do people still say ""hip?""). So back to the hot sauce--how fun! I loved trying the spiciest ones to test how much I can handle. The ghost is their hottest I think, which I could handle, but the flavor isn't as tasty as the less spicy sauces. Burrito combo Thursday special! My whole wheat veggie burrito was SO good. The ingredients tasted extremely fresh, even the cheese (what?!). They also loaded us with yummy, crispy, seasoned chips and salsa. The second best thing about Tijuana Flats, after the hot sauce bar, is the service. I was greeted immediately in a non-annoying way & was informed of the special while handed a menu. I also came after the normal lunch rush so service was particularly attentive and fantastic. But I don't doubt it's always spot-on. I'm probably going to return...a lot. Maybe I'll run here to make room for some of their yummy food; it'll make me feel better anyways!"

2013-10-11,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Cafe Tiramisu,"I've been here twice and was not impressed with either visit.The first visit was about six months ago.  My girlfriends and I sat out on the patio.  I ordered a salad and a lemon drink.  I do not remember the name, but it was on their little drink menu.  It was so sour that I could not drink it.  When it was time to order our entrees, I explained to the waitress that my large salad was enough for me to eat and that I was vegan.  All entrees at this restaurant are meat based.  I have had gastric bypass and don't order much food but the waitress seemed concerned and pressured me into ordering an entree.  She offered me a tofu dish that was not on the menu.  Tofu, if prepared and cooked correctly, can be wonderful.  The ""dish"" they served me was a block of tofu with grill marks on it.  It was disgusting.  The ceiling fan outside made the patio too cold and several guests complained, but the fan was apparently broken and could not be turned off.My second visit was just last weekend.   This time my girlfriends and I sat inside.  As someone who has had gastric bypass, I am super sensitive to alcohol and a single beverage is more than enough to get me inebriated.  I asked the waiter for ""something fruity"".  He brought me a large, green drink.  It was delicious.  I drank the whole thing on an empty stomach while waiting for my salad and did not even feel my face warm up.  There was no alcohol in it. That is very disappointing as the drink cost almost $9.  I ordered a salad that was supposed to feature walnuts and pecans.  There were three tiny pieces of nuts in the huge salad.  This time the waiter did not pressure me into ordering an entree when I said that the salad was enough food for me.  When it came time for desserts, I wanted to have a cup of coffee to sip on as my friends ate their sweets.  The waiter informed me that they do not keep soy or almond milk on hand.  This meant I had to sit there with nothing to eat or drink while my girlfriends ate their slices of cake."

2013-11-08,5.0,"Apex, NC",Bloomsbury Bistro,"Just when i almost gave up on the entire fine dining industry in Raleigh area...i came cross upon Bloomsbury Bistro! Tears in the eyes!!Although it has a slightly weird location and a not-so-upscale storefront everything looks fantastic once you step in. Very very cute ambiance. I love that they have a spacious coat hanging area right next to the front entry. Host can not be more hospitable. Waiters know the strong suits on their menu and make recommendations that perfectly cater to our request. The timing of every course and every check-up is the most satisfying one i have had so far, even if i have dined in many acclaimed fine dining restaurants in big cities.The menu changes often so i cannot really make any specific recommendations.  Having said that, I love their general execution on the quail dish and fish dish so if you are not sure what to get, dive into these two pools. In general terms, I find that the chef here knows exactly how to pair taste (salty VS sweet) and texture (softness VS chewiness) so that you get such a harmonious complexity in one bite. That is exactly why i go fine-dining so this place is like a dream-come-true."

Nestled in Seaboard, Donatos is a tiny little place where you can eat in if you want and/or are lucky enough to score a table. It doesn't have that warm of an inside feel though, so this place scores big for being excellent for take-out. The items on the menu are plentiful and fresh in the Italian arena. I definitely have to venture back to try their pizza as it looked super fresh and amazing! I ordered the veggie sub which included all fresh veggies, naturally, and a balsamic dressing. The bread tasted like it was made that morning and baked fresh just for me!I would definitely grab another bite from Donatos and hope that they are able to stick around long enough for me to have lots more opportunities!!!"

2013-12-30,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Char-Grill,"I tried the Char-Grill near Glenwood again, because Snoopys was closed...I live right around the corner and have been a few times. Every time I go the burger is way over cooked and dry. The amount of lettuce this last time I went had more volume than the burger itself and made it very difficult to hold and try to keep together. I paid extra for cheese and i was watching as they made my meal and they put a whopping half of a slice of american cheese on it.  I also ordered a grilled cheese($1.85...not too bad) plus bacon(no idea how much the bacon cost me since it wasn't on the menu that I noticed, nor the price for cheese for that matter, nor did i receive any sort of receipt with my order)  The grilled cheese was smaller around than a hockey puck and less than half thickness, consisting of one slice of american cheese and a slice of bacon broken in half  to make it seem like 2. it was pretty tasty for the 3 bites it lasted. I definitely learned my lesson to never order a grilled cheese, I can make one 10 times better at home for less money. it's probably a good size for a kid if you want to feed your kid bread saturated in oil with processed cheese on it. If you are at the end of glenwood south and looking for a cheap greasy bite to eat, snoopys is so much better flavor wise and I can get the same amount of food for a couple bucks cheaper....This is in no way a review of every char-grill just the one on Hillsborough st. I used to always eat at  the one on Creedmoor Rd. and loved it, but everytime I've been to this one it always disappoints me."
2013-12-31,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bloomsbury Bistro,"Oh. My. Yum. Andrew and I have been gazing at the Bloomsbury Bistro with longing eyes since we moved to Five Points, but have never felt like we could splurge on a night out here. Thank goodness for visiting parents! Definitely one of my top three meals in the Triangle EVER.The ambiance is intimate and candle lit. Elegant, but not stuffy.  I was thankful that even though the restaurant is small, it wasn't so tight that we were overhearing the conversations of neighboring tables. Our server was cheery and attentive and she gracefully accommodated our indecisive nature.Dinner began with a complimentary bread basket paired with a delicious herbed butter. The wine menu has a good selection of wines by the glass and the bottle (I chose a stellar Sonoma Pinot Noir). The rest of the table opted for specialty cocktails which were very strong (too strong for some), but well crafted with interesting flavor profiles. From what I understand, the menu changes often, but I have to describe our food as it was incredible. We started off with appetizers - a divine truffled potato torte and a ""rueben-style"" quail that was perfectly cooked. Textures, flavors, presentation, spot on.I ordered the mushroom risotto cakes with butternut squash which was incredible. I literally said ""wow"" on the first bite, the second bite and the third. Others at the table ordered the swordfish, the venison (very rare to find at a restaurant!) and the short ribs. The portions were significant - this is not a restaurant that gives you a tiny pea-sized entree- and everyone still cleaned their plate.We ended the night with cappuccinos and desserts - the hazelnut chocolate torte, apple cobbler with rum raisin ice cream and ""figgy"" creme brulee were all delicious. This is certainly one of the best fine dining establishments in the Triangle. A perfect choice for your next celebration!"

2014-01-06,3.0,"Washington, DC",Char-Grill,"Char-Grill has been open at this location since 1959.  And it is by far the best location (I've tried several).  It still has the original walk-up ordering system.  No interior, limited outdoor seating.I don't eat beef, so I usually stick to french fries.  And the french fries are perfect.  Neither thin-cut nor thick-cut, they are perfectly crispy on the outside, but you can still tell that actual potato is on the inside.  Plus, quite often you can elect to wait for the next batch, which will come out piping hot.  A small is a solid serving, and everything there is also really inexpensive."

2014-01-23,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Lee’s Kitchen,"I discovered this place awhile ago but for some reason never got around to writing a review.  well today's the day so here i go, i had been hearing about this place from a few  friends of mine for a long time before ever going there . they talked about how good the jerk chicken sandwich was so naturally that's what i went with when i decided to stop by. i can honestly say that for once gossip was true , because that jerk chicken was right on the money.Moist and full of flavor, fries also came with the sandwich and they were just as good.The menu consisted of all the Jamaican classics, rice and peas, ox tails, meat patties everything you would expect from a Jamaican restaurant. I highly recommend this place, so far they are the best around in my opinion. i encourage everyone to give them a ""look-see"" if your in the area."
2014-01-23,5.0,"Pittsburgh, PA",Flights Restaurant & Lounge,"Flight's chef Dean Thompson won the recent-ish Fire in the Triangle competition, so I decided to give the place another try for a restaurant week lunch.  Overall, this gets a three star rating for me - 5 stars for the food, 1 star for the service.  I hate to do it Dean, but service counts.   The food...   The restaurant week meal included a cup of Smoked Tomato Bisque with Grilled Bread; an Asian BBQ Pork Sandwich with Sweet Potato Fries; and Blueberry Crepes with Lavender Whipped Cream.  The food was excellent.  The soup was rich and creamy with a touch of basil oil.   The pork sandwich was served on a steamed bun that looked a little off, but tasted fantastic.   A touch of cilantro brightened it up and the soft bun was perfect.   The crepes were not my favorite, but well done nonetheless.   The service...  I made a reservation online - unnecessary because the place was dead.  We were seated in a half booth/half table thing near the window.  The sun was in my face and I had to ask for the blinds to be lowered.  The hostess did lower them, but not enough, so I had to ask again.  10 minutes goes by...all we have is water and have been ready to order since we came in the door.   We finally got a server, dressed in an all black ensemble that looked like it hadn't been washed in a week.   She was unable to describe the mushroom ragout for my friend, so we got two of the pork sandwiches.   Took forever to get each course - so slow.  Also took forever to settle the checks.  I get that it's a three course meal, but pace matters at lunch - we had work to get back to.   Overall, there's a huge disconnect between the food and decor and the staff/service experience."
2014-02-05,5.0,"Apex, NC",Flights Restaurant & Lounge,"I treated my wife to Flights last night for her birthday and Chef Dean, Chef Anthony and our server Paige really took care of us. Not only was the service top-notch, but the food was otherworldly. The beef short-rib was succulent with a nice bark and the foie gras and bone marrow mixture was so savory and like nothing I have ever had before. The desert was impeccable and the wine was amazing. We couldn't have had a better experience. I know people like to frequent some of the trendier spots in the Raleigh/Durham area, but this hidden gem is not to be missed."
2014-02-09,5.0,"Durham, NC",Donatos Raleigh,"I'm always on the lookout for a good thin crust pizza and these guys do it pretty darn good!  They take the toppings all the way up to edge and don't skimp.  The sauce has a nice tang to it and the crust holds up everything well and has a nice crunch.  I also love that they cut the pie in squares, which is what I'm used to having grown up in Chicago.  It makes the middle slices extra special cos they're extra cheesy!The only thing I wish is that they had fountain service (bottles only in a cooler) and more tables AND that they'd get a location in Durham!  Otherwise I have no complaints!Oh yes, sign up for their newsletter!!  You get a free pizza for signing up and then lots of great deals thereafter!"

I have never been able to find a pizza like it in Raleigh UNTIL NOW! Donatos has the thin crust, square cut pizza that I dream about! Being a strict pepperoni pizza only eater, I thoroughly enjoy their Pepperoni Zinger.The management is amazing! I have ordered a bulk order on a holiday and they generously gave me a discounted rate and helped me take it out to the car.I recommend signing up for their email club! You will automatically get a medium 1-topping pizza. They send out coupons often!"
2014-02-21,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Seaboard Cafe,"I've gone to Logan's several times, but never knew this place existed until this week.  I went for lunch on a not so beautiful day in February.  As a quick FYI, they don't accept Amex, so it is a little difficult for a charged business lunch (I would absolutely order in to the office if they did).The atmosphere is very casual and they have plenty of outdoor/indoor patio seating.  Essentially in/next to Logan's, you are surrounded by plants which creates a really relaxed vibe.  I'm sure the experience would be excellent on a nice day.Typical of many cafes, the food is very recognizable, though it did seem slightly better in quality and flavor than your average deli/cafe.  I've heard the chicken/tuna salads are very good, though I stuck to a plain sandwich and fries.  Basic but delicious (I have a soft spot for waffle fries).The best part about the whole experience is the owner and staff.  It is hard to rate a place with a very normal/average menu 5-stars, but this is the reason why.  He is very friendly and talkative, and will come around to the tables to make sure everything is going well.  You don't find the old fashioned level of hospitality much these days.  The cafe already has a great homely feel, but this is just enhanced by the easy going and accepting atmosphere.Would definitely check out for a relaxed lunch!"
2014-02-21,4.0,"Great Falls, VA",Bloomsbury Bistro,"The food's good, but service is not up to par, considering their prices. When we got there, some confusion arose over a member of our party who was at the bar. We had to go over and get her. Then, as the meal was ending, it was nearly impossible to get the waiter to refill our water glasses. After trying to find him for 5 minutes, I had to go into the kitchen to ask for a pitcher. This is not a big restaurant, so it's sort of odd where the waiter went. He never came over to ask how the food was and pretty much was AWOL during the meal. It's unfortunate, since this place is close to where my relatives live, but all of us agreed that it's unlikely we'll return."
2014-02-27,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Donatos Raleigh,"Pizza from Ohio?  Well that's Donato's game here in Raleigh!  This Mid-West pizza chain's location in Seaboard is mostly take-out but don't fret.  With online ordering and coupons from their online club, you can order their eats pretty quickly and inexpensively.  I needed a bite before a football playoff game so I did a meatball sandwich, buffalo chicken sandwich and wings for pick-up.  Thirty minutes I swung by to grab my order, there's a very small and limited seating area.  Employees at the counter were super well-trained and personable, big plus there.  And the food was solid for fast food.  The sandwiches were well-toasted and grilled with some butter.  The meatball grinder was filling but beware, their tomato sauce is pretty sweet.  The wings were small but quite spicy.  So yeah, I can say everything hit the spot for me, certainly at least comparable to Dominos, I'd actually have to say I prefer Donato's.  So after one quick visit, I'll have to come back for seconds but certainly put them on your short list for delivery pizza and sandwiches.  And welcome to Raleigh, Donatos!"

2014-03-03,5.0,"Cary, NC",Seaboard Cafe,"Really pleasant and yummy, but hard to find electronically.  LOLThe Cafe is actually hidden inside the Logan's building. Do not trust the street address and GPS, or you will end up way down the block near Peace China looking at a photo of the dumpsters, no lie!  I added a storefront picture to their profile to help you find it.  I had a laugh with the owner over Raleigh's ""permission"" for him to only post his signs facing the railroad tracks, not the entrance of the building.  Being so hidden has not apparently hurt their popularity, but it can be aggravating if you have only heard of a place and want to drop in.This was a great stop while in-town for a Saturday.  You order your food and it is brought to you.  The staff were very attentive, asking several times if I needed anything or a refill, but it was not precisely waiter service.  As others stated hear, this is located inside a wonderful garden center, so toss off the formalities!  I had the daily special, which sounded odd:  tuna fish salad with whole cranberry jam and Swiss, but it really fit together nicely and was more like a Thanksgiving sandwich than anything fishy.  You can sub the side, so I went with the chili, a mostly kidney bean and meat blend with just the right spices and cumin."
2014-03-09,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Donatos Raleigh,"Pizza so good that I'm barely speaking to Husband!  We had  been wanting to try Donatos  for a long time.  After a long drive home from a weekend away (and not wanting to cook dinner), Husband suggested picking up a pizza to bring home.  (He is truly brilliant...all was well at this point).  So he called in our order from I-40.  Wanting to try the Spicy Pepperoni heard about, were sadly told they couldn't make it for us.  Oh well,   Plan B was plain pepperoni. I was okay with  this plan. Now we knew parking can be a real problem. I was driving and prepared to pull up, drop off Husband to pick up pizza, then head home.  Since we assumed we would arrive to no parking places, we were amazed to discover on this Sunday night, parking wasn't a problem.  (miracle!)  Instantly, my brain went to immediate gratification mode.  Sadly, Husband's did not.  He still wanted to wait until we drove this beauty all the way home...wah!  I wanted to sit down and go for it...parking space, empty tables, we were allowed to change our minds and stay, rather than drive home first...but NO...Husband was bound and determined to stick with the original plan.  Sigh, being the good wife that I am, I let him have his (wrong) way.  Although I did steal a quick piece that was hot and yummy and burned my mouth, but was oh so good! (luckily they cut it into small pieces so it's easy to steal a bite).Off we went all the way to our North Raleigh home, with me sending pleading looks to Husband, hoping he would pass me a piece, but no he was determined to wait until home! wtf? (anyone seen my Husband, because I wasn't recognizing him at this point?)  I even told him I felt for our dog, knowing something good was right there but not being able to get one's paws on it.  (whine whine)   Home we made it and our pizza was cooling off, yet still delicious! Perfectly cooked thin crust with a slight char and not a single  vacant pepperoni spot.  Still, was much more amazing piping hot with earlier stolen bites)  so don't do as we did...dive in immediately!) Still, both of us very much liked it! Note:  Sign up for their email club.  I had done so in the past, and gotten a coupon for their Spicy Pepperoni (which had expired). Would still love to try it Donatos, should you get the spicy cheese in!"

2014-03-11,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Zoës Kitchen,"To be perfectly honest Zoe's is by far my favorite casual fast chain around. I know no matter which one I go to that the food is always consistent and the staff is helpful and friendly. I'm at the point now where I sort of order the same thing every time I go but every once in awhile I'll try something different.I love Zoe's because they give me yummy healthy food and they also don't mind when I stay around for a few hours pop a squat and work away. Today I munched on a grilled chicken and slaw pita with a side of fresh fruit. No slimy fruit cup here just a full serving of strawberries, red grapes, pineapple, and cantaloupe it hit the spot. I also love Zoe's slaw and this girl hates slaw. Slaw has always been disgusting to me mostly because I hate mayo but now i have discovered this delicious slaw that has no mayo and is mixed with green onions, feta, and a light vinaigrette.This location is conveniently located right in North Hills next to the Harris Teeter. You can find plenty of parking in the adjacent parking deck so it's an easy spot to grab something to eat for there or to go. Zoe's is great at catering and to go orders so pick up the phone and order away.  Today I was able to enjoy my lunch on the nice patio outside, perfect for people watching during the day. There area a lot of businesses nearby so you can see all kinds of folks in this shopping center. Zoe's is always on my list for a fast lunch or casual dinner!"

Curry Chicken, Jerk Chicken, Ox tail, and Brownstew Chicken. I recommend each and every one of them!!! And the  sides...plantains, YUM!! Green, rice & beans, mixed veggies, mac & cheese.....its all good.What I like most is I feel like I am eating home cooked food. Its not fancy,  not trying to ""be"" anything...just good food...and lots of it!! My one order usually lasts me 2-3 meals!   Oh, and NO pork, if that matters to you. I heard them telling a customer that they cook their greens with turkey. No pork in any meat or veggie. Also, I've only had their dinner ""plates"" (take out only)...lunch may be a smaller portion.Its easy to miss...inside the  kind of run down strip mall at Spring Forest & Capital Blvd (where the Food Lion is).That's all I have to say..now, stay away. :)"

2014-04-08,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Flights Restaurant & Lounge,"I agree that the atmosphere isn't the greatest but it's a restaurant in a hotel so I wasn't too surprised by that. Ever since hearing the name Dean Thompson from Fire in the Triangle I've been dying to get here I just never found the right opportunity. Well the Big Boss Dinner they hosted for NC Beer Month was just the ticket.For $55 we had one of the most amazing meals ever. The entire menu for the evening was revolved around wild game. Our server was incredibly attentive and we never had to ask for anything. The chef came out before each dish to talk about what they were serving he was very friendly and charming at the same time it made for a great evening. So what did we eat? The 1st course was an alligator corn dog and it was as good as it sounds. 2nd course goose moose this was the course I was most nervous about I hate pate I've tried pate a million times and it still makes me sick thinking about it. Now the goose moose looked just like pate so I was hesitant but what was paired with the goose moose really made this dish incredible it was served in a square toasted bread with greens and grapefruit the flavors worked so well together this actually ended up being one of my favorite dishes of the night. 3rd Course boar Chile relleno I think this was my first experience with boar and it was also delicious tasted more like a brisket it wasn't gamy at all. 4th course and by far one of my favorites was the fish trio with smoked rainbow trout it had bacon in it so good, wild salmon taco, and seared tuna they should just make this a small plate on the menu I would come back every night. 5th course was the star of the night the antelope chop I had no idea they were actually going to serve us an entire antelope chop after all the food we just ate. Again this was my first experience with antelope and OMG I want to do it all over again. It's hard to describe what antelope tastes like it was not a gamy meat either it was served med. rare which was perfect barely any fat on the meat at all, I really enjoyed it. Last but not least the 6th course which was dessert. I'm pretty sure Chef Thompson must have known I was coming because tiramisu is my favorite dessert in the world. He served a banana tirimisu with a raspberry prosecco sorbet with duck bacon (have to throw some game meat in there) let's just say this girl went home very happy.What an incredible night with amazing food. If it wasn't for this beer dinner who knows when I would have made it to Flights, now I can't wait to come back to really see what this restaurant is all about."

It was loaded with oozy mozzarella which made the thin crust less than crisp...it was like a very thin New York Style Pizza...in other words...really GOOD!  We will definitely be back!"

2014-04-30,4.0,"Washington, DC",Cafe Tiramisu,"Wow!  I echo all of the reviews that call this a ""hidden gem.""  After so many superb reviews on Yelp for Cafe Tiramisu, I almost expected to be disappointed, but everything about Cafe Tiramisu lived up to the hype.Like just about every other upscale Italian restaurant in the Triangle, it's tucked into a strip mall--but you forget about that once you're inside.  The place is certainly tiny--room for about 40 in the dining room and maybe another ten at the bar.  Because of that, the bar has a lively dining scene--definitely casual and intimate.  The whole place was dimly lit, but inviting.  I believe that in nice weather there's additional seating on a patio.  I sat at the bar, and the bar service was a little iffy (although there was one bartender to serve drinks to the whole restaurant and wait on a couple of couples--so I don't blame the restaurant).  I could also tell that a lot of people there were regulars--especially at the bar--which is a good sign!I ordered a medium-bodied red and liked the bartender's choice (it was a nice pour--another benefit of sitting at the bar).  I was immediately enticed by the chicken special: grilled chicken baked with spinach, eggplant, prosciutto, provolone, and shrimp in a spicy tomato cream sauce and served with a side of house-made spinach linguine in a light alfredo sauce.  I ordered it, without checking on the price, and it ended up coming to $23, only a few dollars over most of their other entrees!  I was so impressed (I expected it to be around $30, given how some other area Italian restaurants price-gouge a bit with their specials).The meal started--even at the bar--with bread.  It was warm, crispy on the outside and soft in the center, and served with olive oil with herbs (I want to say crushed fresh basil) in it.  It was very tasty.  Then, my entree.  It was huge--there was a lot of chicken.  The tomato broth/sauce it was served in was wonderful.  The chicken was just a tad dry, but other than that the dish was great.  The real knockout winner of the night, however, was the fresh spinach linguine.  It is the best pasta I have tasted in my entire life (and yes, I've been to Italy and had Italian in New York).  I could tell it was homemade because it was unevenly shaped and because it just tasted fresh--so fresh that it almost melted in my mouth.  Also, the alfredo sauce was very, very light, so it didn't overpower the pasta at all (honestly, I could barely tell it was there).  I am normally not a fan of ordering pasta at restaurants because it's such a high-markup item, but just a plate of this pasta would definitely be worth it.And, I had the self restraint to save half of my entree so I could order the famous tiramisu for dessert.  I love tiramisu and I was definitely glad I ordered it (and it was definitely enough to share, so I took home half of that too).  It was really really creamy and mascarpone-y, and served with chocolate syrup on the plate that added more of the chocolate flavor to the dish.  Honestly--heavenly!A meal for two with two entrees, two glasses of wine, and sharing an appetizer and a dessert would come to about $100, including tax and tip.  From my experience, it's worth every penny."

2014-05-02,2.0,"Washington, DC",Bloomsbury Bistro,"This was definitely one of the best meals I have had in the Triangle.  All of our food was wonderful--from the bread and soft herbed butter right down to the dessert we shared.  The menu changes so often that I won't go into details about the specific items we ordered, but I will say that we were really impressed with the creativity of the menu.  The items were really well thought out, the flavors went well together, and the presentation was spot on.  Really, this was one of the few $50/person+ meals I've had in the Triangle that wowed me.The only reason this isn't a five-star review is the atmosphere...it just wasn't anything special--neither traditional (think Second Empire or the Wine Cellar at the Angus Barn) nor modern (think Mandolin or Lantern).  It felt sort of stuffy--murals on the walks, a definitely older clientele.  And the tables were very close together for a fine-dining restaurant in Raleigh (the two-person tables at least)."

2014-05-09,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Cafe Tiramisu,Loved it! I had the veal parm and the pasta and marinara sauce on top was amazing. I devoured this meal. We started with the stuffed clams which were a little spicy. I wasn't expecting that but again the plate was cleaned quickly. Added some lemondrops to go a long with that which hit the spot.My wife had the gnocchi which we both loved. It had really good flavors and the garlic was just right on it. I want to go back and try some of other other veal plates like the veal tortellini.The location can get a little loud inside though since it's small. Make sure you are entering through the correct door though. There is a pub right next to it and it can get a little confusing as to which door to go in through.The service was a little slow but that may be the pace there.

Raleigh called Red Pepper Asian!  Located in a very quiet strip plaza, Red Pepper has a nice menu of Chinese and Thai dishes with Malaysian mixed in.  I order up paper-wrapped chicken, Singapore rice noodles and Sambal shrimp and string beans.  The interior is comfortable and casual, it takes 15 minutes for my food and it's excellent. Tender, flavorful chicken, slightly curried rice noodles and spicy, shrimp with a bit of heat.  Overall I found all my dishes pretty authentic and well-done.  If I lived in the area I'd certainly come back but due to its location, Red Pepper will be a once in a while treat.   But if you're looking for interesting and spicy ethnic eats in E.

2014-05-14,3.0,"Garner, NC",Char-Grill,"I graduated from NC State so I am familiar with a number of the restaurants on Hillsborough street.  Char Grill for me and my friends is an institution.  Char-Grill has hands down some the best burgers in North Carolina.  I love that they are still doing things the same way they have since I was going there for a late night nosh back in my college days.  One thing that is a must try is their apple pies.  They remind me of getting a Coke made with cane sugar.  They are not baked, they aren't made with splenda, they are deep fried in oil in all of their horrifically bad for you glory.  One other thing they have that I always loved is the crushed ice in the drinks.  Again very old school.Atmosphere 6 - Okay it is 50+ years old and there is no indoor seating and you have to get a key to use the unisex bathroom but that is what I love about it.  It really has a 60's hamburger stand feel.  It feel like it has the gravitas of a place that was able to not change for half a century.  If you need to eat your burger inside there is ample parking.Service 5 - Well there isn't really a ton of service.  You slide a piece of paper down a slot and wait for your number to be called.  The number is on the paper you send down the chute.  That being said the counter guys are consistently friendly and happy to see you.Cost 5 - The price is not bad at all for what you get.  You can get a 1/2 pound burger, fries, and a drink for around $7.  That is on a par with what you would spend at McDonald's for pink sludge burgers.  Food 6 - I love the food!!  I saw one of my college buddies a grown man who lives in Charlotte now have a full blown meltdown when he thought he was getting skrewed out of his Char-Grill.  To be cruel I will on occasion send him pictures of me eating there."
2014-05-15,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Glenwood Grill,"I searched Yelp with my sister for a restaurant to check out in the area with our dad for dinner. We picked Glenwood Grill based on the Yelp reviews and menu items (I love seafood!) and we definitely didn't regret it! I didn't read the reviews in depth so I didn't realize it was located in a strip mall but although that was a bit discouraging, our anxiety was put at ease once we were inside. We were greeted and asked if we made a reservation and told that they were busy so there'd be a wait. Luckily, after a few minutes at the bar, a reservation was a no-show so we had a table within 5 minutes! Yay!The restaurant itself is small so it makes sense they rely on reservation, the bar was tucked away in the corner with a TV. It's nice that there's a slight wall partition between the bar and dining area though. This place is a great restaurant for a date or with family. The decor and candles everywhere give it a nice romantic and intimate vibe. The lighting is dim which is nice to keep the mood set although it does get loud. The service was very hands off and laid back which is fine with me since they checked in on the food and if we needed more drinks. Onto the food! We started off with a half order of crab cakes as an appetizer. It was $10 for one large crab cake on creamed corn with a side of an arugula salad with bleu cheese, pecans and granny smith apples. I was a bit sad the crab cakes aren't good on their own, but with the creamed corn they're delicious! The arugula salad was good and the apples were a nice touch. Although it was small, it was a good starter for the three of us since they also gave us bread rolls and butter before the meal. I ordered the seafood and grits (has scallops and shrimp--my favorites!) and was pleasantly surprised by how delicious it was! Mainly because when it came out, it looked like there was too much sauce in the dish (see my picture). However, it complimented the grits and seafood and vegetables VERY well. The added gorgonzola was a very nice touch. The scallops were nicely cooked but the shrimp was only okay, still good but a bit bland for me. The vegetables and bacon were a nice addition as well; definitely a lot of flavors! I would definitely recommend this dish and will order it again!My dad ordered the Carpet-Bagger and literally licked the plate clean... I think that says enough about it. I'll probably order that nice time although I'm not a huge fan of oysters, but they're fried so it'll be tasty, right? My sister ordered the Flat Iron Steak and said it was good but wasn't as into the parmesan potatoes. Overall, I will definitely go back to this restaurant (with a reservation). The seafood is from the outer banks (NC local, yay) and the food is delicious and decadent."

2014-05-23,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Babylon Restaurant,"We always love to go to Bablyon when the weather is nice and we can enjoy the courtyard. Bablyon has a very ""Miami"" like feel outside which is a nice change for Raleigh. This past weekend we went to the Bablyon with a group of 8, sat outside, and our experience was very positive:Food:Everyone in the group really enjoyed their meals. We tried the Chicken Bastilla, Calamari, Chicken Skewers,Shrimp Provencale, Filet Mignon, Lamb Tangine, special of the day salmon, and hummus. My favorite was the Chicken Bastilla. It is a very different concept between the sweet and spicy flavors; however, it makes for a great last bite. Drinks:Our only criticism was that there were a handful of beers and wines that were on the menu, but when requested, they were out of stock. I understand this happens on occasion but it felt like everything we asked for at first was sold out. However, they recommended additional bottles of wine as replacements and were very good. Atmosphere:The atmosphere was great as the weather was beautiful and everyone was enjoying it. Be aware that they serve Hookah outside. This was not a problem for us and we didn't really notice much; however, is is good to be aware of if you don't want to smell or be near the smell of Hookah. Service:Kristen was our server and did a great job. All of the food and drinks came out in a timely fashion and always ensured we had everything that we needed even with the large group. Overall: I would recommend this restaurant to anyone look to have dinner in a nice outdoor environment, get that ""Miami"" feel, looking to try Moroccan food, or just up for trying something different."

They also use real plates and silverware which is nice for a fast casual place. Unfortunately the food left something to be desired. It wasn't bad by any means. We got the family platter with mixed kabobs. The kabobs were were cooked perfectly but they were kind of bland for my taste and I didn't really like the teriyaki steak kabobs. They do have an app you can take a picture of your receipt on and get free goodies which was nice.

The first time I tried the frosted shortbread it was perfection, though the second visit (when I brought Yelper Joanne L) the cookies weren't as fresh :( I'm looking forward to trying them a 3rd time and hope it matches my first visit. The cookies come in 3 sizes, and the largest is still less than $2. Great deal. They have sandwiches and other sweets, but I can't comment on those. It's an order at the counter and go sort of place, and a great option for an affordable dessert after eating at Centro."

2014-06-02,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Jimmy V’s Osteria & Bar,"Oh what a difference a day can make...I do believe this place is on the rebound!    We went for Sunday lunch, and it was hopping (probably thanks in large part to the Ironman finish line being right out front).    I am happy to report that this time the kitchen looked professional, and the food was better.  Husband got the Chopped Salad, which he said was good, but lacking in much meat.  He didn't detect any of the bacon it was supposed to have, and very little turkey or prime rib.  I tried the spaghetti with garlic & oil that was described as having roasted garlic cloves, chile peppers, marinated charred tomatoes and arugula.  Sister got the same thing, but added the chicken option to hers.  (which she said didn't add much to it as the chicken wasn't grilled, just small cubes with a hint of oregano).  The pasta was not quite what I had pictured based on the description.  The garlic wasn't roasted, but it was present, which is always good.  It was loaded with pickled spicy peppers, which I happen to like, but I don't know that they were chile peppers?  There was very little of the tomatoes...would have liked more emphasis on the tomato and less of peppers.  Loved the arugula.  The pasta itself was broken pieces of spaghetti, which was a bit odd, but okay.    I did get to sample Stepmom's meatball and it was quite good.  Brother in law liked his chicken wings.  For dessert we passed around the gelato trio and the mini cannoli's. Pretty good.  Happy to report that sanitation rating has inched up to a 91, which although not jumping up and down good, is much better than where it was."
2014-06-04,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Flights Restaurant & Lounge,"It's been way too long since I've been here!   Triangle Restaurant Week brought three of us in for lunch on this Wednesday and it was pretty terrific.  Three courses for $15.  First course was a choice of Golden Watermelon Salad or Clam Chowder with Sea Salt Biscuit.  Two of us had the rich and creamy clam chowder, chock full of clams, corn, potato and sausage.  One gal had the salad and said it was good.  It looked cool and light.  Second course, one gal had the Italian Ham Baguette with fries, the other had the Crab Cake with Bacon and Fries, and I had a very awesome Ziti Carbonara with Sausage, White Beans, Brussel Sprouts, Grilled Bread, with a perfectly poached egg on top and fresh herbs.  I have never had a really good carbonara in a restaurant...until now...this was beautifully executed, with just the right amount of richness.  Super YUM!  And, lucky me, had enough leftover for a delicious dinner as well.  Both other gals were happy with their sandwiches.  I did get to try the crab cake, which was good, but breaded and fried.     Third course was a choice of four desserts.  We each tried a different one.  I had the fresh berry cake which was served with ice cream.  The cake itself was dry.  I ate the berries off of it.  Another had the carrot cake blondies with candied walnuts and carrots.  I tasted this and the cake itself was a bit dry, but the walnuts and carrots were really good!  Oddly enough, the cheesecake ice cream was served with my berry cake (by mistake, I'm sure), and the carrot cake had plain vanilla.  Once we switched, we were both happier about it.  Meanwhile, other gal was chowing down on the Opera Torte that was full of good chocolate.  As she put it (this isn't Hershey's!)."
2014-06-04,4.0,"Pittsboro, NC",Saltwater Seafood & Fry Shack,"Apparently all the fresh seafood goes to their ""fry shack"" because the alleged fresh fish they sell is neither fresh nor good. We drove a long way to get there yesterday and it was definitely NOT worth the effort. The fish on display all had cloudy eyes, smelled bad and definitely were not what I would call fresh. I decided to buy a piece of grouper which looked to be the best of a bad lot. Big mistake. We transported it home in a cooler with ice  and when we opened the cooler, the smell was awful. We ended up feeding it to the cats.Major disappointment."

In fact, I'd never heard of the place when I first stopped in. I just knew my Tuesday kickball games were a few hundred yards away and I needed some food after work.I wasn't expecting much going in. It looks like a gas station and the menu is unassuming - mainly pizza, pasta and sandwiches. I put in an order for an $8 grilled chicken panini and was thrilled with what happened next.The cooks grill up fresh chicken and veggies on the flat top right before your eyes - no frozen microwaved protein here. While the resulting enormous sandwich isn't what I call a panini - it wasn't pressed - I could not have cared less. It was fantastic. I don't know where they get their pesto, but I want a lifetime supply of it. The focaccia is wonderful. The pesto and chicken are wonderful. The spinach is fresh. The chunks of mozzarella are on point. Overall, it's one of the better sandwiches I've had in a long time. Put that together with friendly service, and you've got a great go-to spot for a quick, inexpensive bite to eat.I have to admit I've never had anything else on their menu, but with fresh, homemade ingredients, I'm guessing they're good as well."

2014-06-15,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Piola,"A solid pizza spot with some genuinely tasty and creative offerings, how good the pizza is really depends on who's in the kitchen. Quite often the crust comes out soggy and underdone, and it never seems worth it to send it back for what can be a long wait for a decently crisp one. The toppings are usually fresh and good, creatively put together and well thought out, but some of the line cooks need a lot more training on how to use an oven.Same story for the gnocchis. The sauces are generally quite good, but how well done or how raw in the middle  they come out depends on who's paying attention or not on the line. Kitchen should step up their game, then they would definitely be a strong contender on the RDU gourmet pizza scene.  As it is, they're not bad, but the inconsistency in execution is a real problem at this location that brings down their rating."
2014-06-17,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Brookside Market & Deli,"A hidden gem! A short walk from our house, we get dinner from here usually once a week.Delicious pizza... Their speciality pizzas are great, I would recommend with the Bruschetta and Pesto Chicken. If you prefer a thicker crust pizza, the Sicilian is wonderful as well!You also can't go wrong with their calzones (huge and delicious), but I wasn't as much of a fan of their strombolis, a bit too juicy/saucy for my taste.Their pasta dishes are tasty as well. A bit more pricey than other things on the menu but you get a lot of food.They also have some sandwiches worth trying. The grilled chicken panini is very tasty on fresh homemade bread and bigger than I expected. But I would pass on chicken parmigiana, not impressive.They are more of a takeout (or delivery) place but they do have a few tables inside and outside if you wanna eat there.  The market attached has a decent selection of beer and wine, I would recommend grabbing a six back or a bottle of wine on your way home for a quick/easy/tastey dinner!"

I go there often on my lunch break, or stop there for coffee on my way to work. The food is decent. The menu offers an average assortment of sandwiches. Some dishes I've ordered have been disappointingly plain. The Carolina Cuban is my go-to and it never disappoints. But for the rather simple cuisine served here, I think the cafe's a bit pricey. Also, they serve draft beer. But nobody orders it. It's weird. I did once. Got stared at. Honestly, I would probably hardly ever go here if it wasn't so close to work. But it is. So I go."

2014-07-03,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Got to Be NC Competition Dining,"A year ago, had I updated my review, I would have changed my rating to 4-stars, due to the excessive commercialization of the event.  Where there is still a lot of that going on, I am happy to say that it is better done than it was a year ago.    Sis and I went to Monday night's Oxford vs. City Kitchen battle of Peaches and Blackberries.  As always, we didn't get to find out the secret ingredients until right before we started tasting them.  In our case, the first plate was served around 7:33 pm.  So this event is not for early diners!  We were out of there around 10:00, having just finished up six courses (two of which were desserts). Also not for those who can't handle lots of rich food that late at night.  I do wish it would start an hour earlier!  Be advised that this event is not for picky folks (you must be willing and able to try anything and everything because the secret ingredient could be ANYthing), and it is NOT for vegetarians.  This night alone we had quail, venison and pork.  As always, the service is outstanding.  This event is not inexpensive, but when you factor in the quality, quantity, and over-all experience, it is well worth it.  (also makes a great gift...we have given this as birthday presents and it's been a hit).  Do know that these events sell out, some more quickly than others, so be watchful and buy quickly when one sounds good to you.    Have to give big kudos to the CHEFS who make this event happen...I applaud all of you and your teams who work so hard and give so much.  It is an HONOR to be able to experience such talent.  It is always extra fun to go to their restaurants after experiencing their work in this realm.  TIP:  GO to one of these events...what an enjoyable event where you can expect the unexpected, AND get to judge it!"

I then asked if they are cooking any seafood from the market which is 10 feet away?"" she replied ""No"". ok. The lady was friendly, but I did drive out of my way looking for fresh seafood.Now, I'm sure the food is good for those who want to eat Chinese farm raised seafood and they do offer a fresh catch of the day  (no telling where it is from) - but I am giving Fry Shack one star because the website and the store location is very misleading.

I always order a fish dish for dinner they have specials every night so I'll normally order one of their specials. The salmon here is absolutely delicious and is the perfect portion. The restaurant is just the right size, it's a nice and cozy place to eat and the noise level is just right.  They also have a few outside tables as well if you want to dine al fresco.I stopped in today for lunch and the menu had a lot to choose from. Salad, sandwiches, wraps and more all ranging from $10 to $13 which was a pretty good deal for the amount of food you got. I ordered the steak wrap with a caesar salad. The wrap was good but wasn't the best thing I've had. Some of the steak was tough but I loved the flavors of the blue cheese, and corn salsa. This is one of those restaurants I almost always order dessert at. I love their creme brulee. Glenwood Grill is a great place for a date night or to take the folks.

2014-07-25,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Zoës Kitchen,"Up until today (Friday), my only Zoes' experiences have been take-out salads that have been brought to me.  (all of which were excellent).    By my lonesome, looking for a quick (yet somewhat healthy) lunch, I thought of this location, and got really lucky with a spot right out front (didn't have to mess with the parking deck).  It is next to Harris Teeter at North Hills.  With no cravings to guide me, I fumbled with the menu because it all sounded great!  Did I want grilled chicken with veggies?  Or a nice salad?  Maybe the new quinoa one?  Instead I managed to order probably the most unhealthy thing on the menu...their pimiento cheese sandwich.  At least I got just half of a grilled one, with some Tomato Bisque (just $6.99 for a combo!)  You order at the counter, then get a drink (tea for me with fresh lemon), then sit down with a number.  Shortly they brought out my fabulous soup.  Wow-fresh!  Loved the cheese on it, and the fresh basil put it over the top.  Served with pita wedges.  Then came the very rich half pimiento cheese sandwich with lettuce and tomato.    This had so much cheese that I squeezed some off to save calories.  But it was so darn good that I ended up eating what I took off with the pita wedges from the soup...hah!  Bad me, but Italian Grandma in heaven would be proud that I didn't waste anything.  Service here, by the way...these guys were friendly and seemed to care very much! And you cannot beat the quality and quantity for the price!   Highly recommend for eat-in or take-out!Edited to add that it's CLEAN clean clean!"
2014-07-25,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Aggie’s Grill Station,"The best way I can describe this place is a restaurant that is like a food court in a mall.  Check out their website and you'll see what I mean.  They have hot subs, salads, Italian items, Asian selections, wings,quesadillas, wraps and burgers.  Their website is very order-friendly.  I know next time I go, I'll order ahead of time and pick it up. With a name that includes ""grill station"", I guess I expected a giant grill to be in sight, but walking in, it was part-store (again mall-like), part doctor's office waiting room (magazines and chairs for waiting for take-out although one was three months old and the other three years old!), and charming little dining rooms, plus an inviting counter for ordering.  You can buy potato chips, or a purse, or jewelry, but no grill to be seen.Service:  FRIENDLY!  Greeted warmly, smiles abound, and the gal that took my order even came around from behind the counter to hand me and another guest our take-outs.Food:  I chose the Champagne Mango Salmon, because the description sounded amazing:  ""Wild Caught Alaskan Salmon naturally steamed with olive oil, cilantro, garlic, lime juice, sesame seed, and sweet teriyaki sauce, with drizzle of champagne mango and red pepper, served with fresh lettuce, and fried rice with diced carrots, peas, onions, corn and string beans."".  What I got, while pretty good, didn't quite match up with that description.  I didn't detect any cilantro, lime juice, sesame seed or teriyaki sauce.  The veggies in the fried rice seemed like frozen mixed veggies with the nice addition of fresh onion.  They gave me a very tasty mayo-type sauce to go with this.  And the fish had more of a white mayo type sauce rather than teriyaki.  What was really lacking with the salmon was texture.  Had there been fresh red pepper and the sesame seed and cilantro it would have added some needed texture. The salmon itself was cooked well.  I will also add that this might not have been the best dish to order as a take-out, perhaps it would have been better to eat-in.All-in-all I would put this more in the 3 1/2 star range, but am rounding up because I am curious to go back and try more."

I am always full of salad, bread, and bang bang shrimp by the time the meal arrives so maybe I need to consider that next time I go. - Some meals have very small portions so be sure to ask your waiter or waitress about that if you're hungry; an example of this is the crab cakes that arrive looking like 2 little golf balls."

2014-07-30,3.0,"Washington, DC",Saltwater Seafood & Fry Shack,"I ordered the shrimp burger--expecting some sort of burger in a patty form--the kind you get in the South Carolina low country. It came with fries and was $7. It was a ton of food for the price, but I got a pile of fries, a plain white bun, and a heading pile of tiny fried shrimp.The shrimp where fine--but completely flavorless. Just breaded and fried popcorn shrimp without any seasoning whatsoever.  For all that grease, I want my food to taste like something.  Honestly, the fries were the best part.This does seem like a nice place to buy fresh seafood though--the cooking style at the grill just leaves something  to be desired."

2014-07-31,2.0,"Carrboro, NC",Midtown Grille,"I have dined here every year for the last 4 years, and I think I just might make it an annual tradition--but always with a different friend! Midtown Grille is a fairly small restaurant at North Hills, but the ambiance compensates for that. There is a private dining room available with glass windows/doors that lengthens the small dining area. The bar is actually pretty spacious and slightly secluded as it is raised up higher than the main floors. Very chic and modernBesides the impeccable service that has always gone beyond my expectations, always, the ever-changing menu is my favorite part. You would think that returning to a restaurant for years would get boring, but the menu here is constantly changing. So you're not going to be stuck with the same limited options. And the ingredients and flavor combos have never failed me yet. There's usually always a special fish entree besides your typical salmon (although they do have a yummy salmon entree), but choose any dish, and I'm sure it'll be delicious. (I had the short ribs last night--oh man, scrumptious!) Another 5 star restaurant at North Hills for me because of the memories, experiences, and delicious, changing menu!!"
2014-07-31,5.0,"Durham, NC",The Square Rabbit,Great place to run in and get a sandwich or an entree type meal on the go.  I'm a fan of their pimento cheese sandwich(with cucumbers a must).  They also have fresh bakes desserts.  Their brownies and coconut maroons are delicious.
2014-08-01,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",El Tapatio Mexican Restaurant,This is one of my go-to spots for Mexican food. The food is always very good. Service is usually pretty fast. They also have some good drink specials.
2014-08-02,5.0,"Philadelphia, PA",Wade Park Cafe,Great little office park cafe for sandwiches and salads for when you forgot your lunch or just don't want to eat what you brought. I've had their salads which are fresh and delicious as well as most of their sandwiches. My cheap favorite is the grilled cheese with bacon on sourdough.
2014-08-03,4.0,"Santa Clara, CA",Aggie’s Grill Station,"Good food! Mozz sticks, egg rolls, butterfly shrimp, subs, fried rice... All r so dank! Really cheap too! Able to try many items for low price. Only bad thing is they have limited beer n wine menu and no liquor drinks. Would still recommend it just for the food tho."
2014-08-05,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Got to Be NC Competition Dining,"I went to Final Fire last night and it was awesome as always.  Though the tables can be a little crowded (that's why 4 out of five), the food is always spectacular and the service and facilitators of the event are so nice. It makes for a fantastic date night or night out with friends!  We can't wait to go to the next one!!!"
2014-08-06,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Zoës Kitchen,"I like beer. I don't go to Zoe's for the beer, but when we get dinner here it means we're taking it across the street where some good beer is about to be consumed. That gets me excited for Zoe's, but the food is definitely the other delicious half of the equation.Lately I've taken to getting the chicken kabobs. Two kabobs on their rice pilaf with a side salad is just the right amount of food. The tabouli salad is also a good option if you're looking for something a little lighter. The braised white beans, roasted vegetables, and chicken & orzo soup will make anything you get even better. Seriously, a plate of just the sides is a great meal.We haven't used their catering, but every time we come in they have an order waiting to go out the door so they must be doing something right on that end as well."
2014-08-10,4.0,"Arlington, VA",Wade Park Cafe,"Great service, great selection, extremely nice people. Clean and quiet scene for an enjoyable meal. I like the fresh fruit selection."
2014-08-11,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bloomsbury Bistro,"You can't go wrong here!  I always check the menu online before I go, since it changes frequently.  Some call out to me more than others, and this Monday a Duck dish in particular was calling out for Sis & I to come spend our monthly dinner-out here.We like to share things, and could not have been happier when our Waiter offered to have each dish separated for us in the kitchen...love that!  We ordered two appetizers and two entrees, and loved that they served them to us as four courses.  We started with a crab dish in filo over sherry-spiked corn with bacon.  Very good!  Next dish we chose was a Vegetable puff pastry ""Samosa"", over a kale & wheatberry salad with vidalia onion chutney.  Very different, and quite good.Next up came the Tiger Shrimp over corn chowder, with asparagus and roasted spaghetti squash.  While very good, it was too similar in taste to the crab appetizer, so I wish we had ordered something different just for variety.  In hindsight, I would have gone with the Ravioli.Star of the show, imho was the Reuben Style Duck over a sautee of rye bread spaetzle and riesling braised sauerkraut, gruyere cheese fondue and thousand island aioli.  Yes, as good as it sounds.All the dishes were prepared in an expert, subtle way.  Flavors are combined without anything overpowering.  Deft.  We washed it all down with a bottle of chardonnay, and also enjoyed their delicious bread with herbed butter.  Portions are very generous, and prices for the quality aren't crazy.  Around $9 to $12 for an appetizer, $20-$30 per entree.  We were too full for dessert, but it sounded good.  Highly recommend this Five Points restaurant!  Also note there is a small bar area with a separate bar menu!"
2014-08-12,5.0,"Hillsborough, NC",The Daily Planet Cafe,"The Daily Planet is a fabulously delicious place to eat for a very fair price. My personal favorite is the Grilled Cheese / Salad Bar combo with the grilled pimento cheese sandwich. The Brie grilled cheese is not my fave, as the brie doesn't get melty enough, IMO.The fish burrito and fish and chips are also amazing, and I recently had the Caprese. HOLY COW it was good!They have beer and wine as well, and bakery-style desserts like giant brownies or small cookies. Something for everyone here, and, again, the price is right."
2014-08-12,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Daily Planet Cafe,"Officially obsessed with the $5 all local breakfast served at the Daily Planet! Love that you can get farm fresh eggs breakfast and local coffee all for $5! Even though the cafe is connected to the museum, it is actually locally owned and independently operated.  The breakfast is not well-known, so you can get in and out when you're in a rush.  Take advantage of this hidden gem."
2014-08-15,5.0,"Fairfax, VA",The Daily Planet Cafe,"This place ROCKS!! My boyfriend and I are traveling cross country and made a point to stop here to see the large planet on the front of the science museum. This cafe is conveniently located RIGHT next to the planet display so we went there to eat. The staff was super friendly and the food came out quickly. It was also very clean which was nice. I was a bit worried at how the quality of the food would be since it came out so quickly but it was DELICIOUS! Not too expensive either, a meal for 2 with 1 drink and a muffin came out to 21 bucks. Would definately come here again....if I lived here lol"
2014-08-17,5.0,"Youngsville, NC",Monapita Mediterranean Grill,"While shopping in this little shopping complex we noticed a new ( to us, it's been here 3 months) Mediterranean place..... And since it was dinner time and we love Mediterranean food it seemed only right to stop in.We ordered the shawarma platter which came with chicken shawarma, pita, rice, salad and hummus and it was all excellent.  I'm a big fan of cardamom and loved that both meat and rice has that distinctive, but not over bearing flavor, that comes with a light touch of cardamom.The husband and wife team working here were very nice and gracious.   We are looking forward to going back to try several of the other things that peaked are interest on the menu ( Moroccan eggplant salad, beef shawarma, kofta, beef skewers, tabbouleh, baklava, and for the hubbie.... Turkish coffee).  If you're in Raleigh on capital/us 1 and over by the new best buy, Michael's, and life way shopping center, look over in the corner where Quiznos use to be and give Mona's a try!"
2014-08-18,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Frank’s Pizza & Italian Restaurant,Old school pizza place. Don't let the exterior fool you. They've been here for a long time for a reason.
2014-08-19,2.0,"New York, NY",The Borough,Fun place. Busy on a Tuesday night. Liked the ambient a lot. Plenty of interesting faces in the crowd. I can't wait for my food to get here.
2014-08-20,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Midtown Grille,"Finally had a chance to check out Midtown Grille this past weekend. Being that this is one of my dad and stepmom's favorite restaurants I had high hopes. However I know they recently change chef's so the menu was brand new when I came in.I decided to take my mom here for her birthday, she never goes out so it's a big deal when I can take her somewhere nice. I made a reservation via Open Table and the hostess graciously sat us upon our arrival. I like the ambiance of the restaurant it's nice and quiet and not stuffy at all. The tables are well spread out and there is great outdoor seating on the patio as well.My mom was already excited about dinner and had checked out the menu before we came. We both started with a glass of wine and decided on the heirloom tomato salad to share as a starter. I'm not sure what happened in this dish but it did not seem to come out at all as the menu described. The good was that the tomatoes were fresh and I enjoyed the house made ricotta cheese I however didn't see or taste any bit of grapefruit in the dish or ham and for $12 it was quite a disappointment, there really wasn't anything special about the dish at all. I ordered the steak frites for dinner I guess for the price and reputation I was just expecting so much more. My steak was cooked well and seasoned well but again I just wanted a little more to the dish and the french fries were blah. My mom ordered the fried chicken it was an interesting dish I had a bite and didn't care for it much. She was also picking bones out of the chicken breast she was eating that I would have assumed was boneless from the presentation. We decided to skip dessert and order some dessert martinis instead I have to say this was the best part of our meal. The service was good and I did really enjoy the environment here I just wish the food was better. I consider this a special occasion restaurant for the prices and it just didn't live up to my expectations. I might give it another chance in a few months."
2014-08-23,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tijuana Flats,"Dang!  Can't believe I've been missing this place when it's so close to home.  Fresh, festive and flavorful!Tried their Mahi tacos and they were totally delicious. Also had to try their queso which was very good as well.  Love the hot sauce bar, although the one I wanted to try the most (the jalapeno one) was either empty or not working on the day we went for lunch.You order at the counter then they bring your hot, fresh food to you.  AND they come around and refill your drinks.  Prices are very reasonable as well!"
2014-08-23,5.0,"Wake Forest, NC",Los Cuates,3 stars just cause its best we have found in NC . I am from AZ and love Mexican food but have NEVER found anything comparable to back home . This place is best we have found out here and we have been searching 3 years . The Carne Asada burritos are good here best you will find probably . So if your from out West this is a good place but its not AZ or CA good just good for NC cause Mexican food sucks out her P.S. don't eat the beans they are NASTY
2014-08-24,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Point at Glenwood,"The brunch today was not what it was before.  Arrived a little after noon and food was lacking.  When we have been to brunch in the past it was great.  Today no potatoes, scrambled eggs,ham or sausage.  It took forever to get the omelet!  When they ran out of something they replaced it with whatever they found in the kitchen!  Very disappointing.  Doubt we will return."
2014-08-25,3.0,"Washington, DC",Char-Grill,"Char-Grill's a solid late dining option. It opens until 2 AM and it serves burgers, hot dogs, fries, milk shakes, etc. Hot Dogs & Char-Burgers're only 2+ bucks a pop. Everything's made fresh right in front of you & they're quite tasty for a fast food joint. It reminds me of Checkers, where a lot of people mostly get the food to go but they also have limited seating if you choose to dine in. I highly suggest getting onion & chilli for the optional toppings; Their chilli's delicious! However, their fries aren't very good since they're very salty...   Overall - 3 1/2 stars"
2014-08-25,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bonefish Grill,"I always enjoy going to bonefish. Good service and good food. If you hit the place at the wrong time though you will be facing a bit of a wait. All of the food I've tried here (salmon, burgers, bread) has been well prepared and tastes great. The service seems ok but can sometimes be a little slow. I get the impression they have a lot of turnover with the wait staff. Anyways, be sure and have the bang bang shrimp! It's what I'd call the flagship menu item"
2014-08-27,4.0,"Houston, TX",Saltwater Seafood & Fry Shack,"I came here with the mindset that i could get some delicious fried food, sit down and relax. Wrong. This place is designed for TAKE OUT EVERYTHING, including ordered food, frozen seafood and iced down fish / shrimp.PROS: A lot of fish, shrimp, and other crustaceans. Crab legs, crabs, oysters, scallops, etc. Also they do have a lot of seafood cooking supplies to purchase.CONS: The food that I had (shrimp and tilapia) was not very good, the fries were cold and the whole thing had that ""fishy"" taste. Also there was only one table outside to eat... Nothing inside. And outside was covered with cig butts and trash.SO! If you want fresh fish to take home and cook, treat this place like a miniature fish market... Lots of variety and from what I could see good prices, but don't treat this place as a restaurant (as it was advertised.)."
2014-08-27,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Borough,"Good option for cheap food and drinks. A long way from being the best food in the area, but it's also among the cheapest in the area. If you complain about the quality but get excited about the prices than you're provably not living in reality anyway. Service is typically good. I like the place when I want a cheap and quick meal and drink during the week. Hard to find a table or place at the bar in Friday and Saturday."
2014-08-28,5.0,"Evanston, IL",Shish Kabob,Great place to grab a quick bite in downtown Raleigh! My boyfriend and I stopped by before a concert one night when we were in a rush and got to enjoy delicious wraps. They're made right in front of you (yay open kitchens!) and were filling and flavorful. I'd come here again if I happen to wind up in this area of downtown Raleigh.
2014-08-29,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Aggie’s Grill Station,First time here service is good decor is well done. Food was good. Had the pineapple shrimp fried rice with 12 shrimp. Very tasty. My wife has Chicken and Teriyaki which tasted ok but the chicken was very soft. We definitely will return; will try lunch next week.
2014-08-30,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bonefish Grill,"I know I know we're not supposed to like chains, but some of them go forth and multiply because they're so darn good, and this is one of them!  Been here several times...from  just drinks and appetizers outside, to full meals inside.  Consistently good!On this Saturday night we arrived around 5:00 and had no problem getting in, but it filled up fast after that.  Despite a less than friendly hostess, we had a wonderful experience.  Excellent wait staff.  Terrific food.  I usually get shrimp and scallops with their delicious mango salsa, but crab cakes were calling to me.  They don't have a crab cake meal, so I ordered the appetizer with a house salad with their house citrus vinaigrette.  Husband got the fish and chips and added a house salad with bleu cheese.  First they brought out a warm and luscious loaf of bread with a kicked up olive oil.  Yum!  I love their chardonnay choices and was happy with the second least expensive William Hill for just $6.50.  Husband did iced tea.  Salads were terrific.  Loved the house dressing, and all the elements were fresh and delicious.    Husband enjoyed his fish and chips, although the chips were just ordinary looking fries.  Must have been good enough though because he polished them off and didn't offer me even one!  The fish was done with a tempura batter served with a very good tartar sauce.   My crab cakes were just as good as I've had before there...love their spicy remoulade!  This time the cakes were maybe a tad too moist (could have used less mayo), but very rich and yummy! I was stuffed.  Husband full but not stuffed.  Great service, wonderful meal, and for very good seafood not a bad price!"
2014-08-30,5.0,"North Raleigh, NC",Flights Restaurant & Lounge,"To enjoy a glass of wine in a VERY quiet spot, go for it. The bartender was friendly and attentive. If you're hungry, I would skip this one. The menu items that we tried were just okay.We were one of 2 parties in the restaurant. Our intention was drinks and a light snack, and for that purpose... sure. Certainly not our first choice in the neighborhood though. There are top notch options just steps away."

2014-09-01,4.0,"Cary, NC",Midtown Grille,"We've came several times over the past couple of years.  This time we had a groupon deal that we remembered we purchased and was expiring.  We made a reservation (that is required with their groupons) even though the place has never been full.  We walked up and were greater by a sign that says ""new menu"" due to a new chef... we were excited.... yet once we were seated we saw almost the same identical menu as each time before.  Don't get me wrong, the food is good ""classic"" food, but don't advertise a new menu if its the same.  The menu has your pretty standard""upscale"" american cuisine.  Our server greeted us and was very prompt until our entrees were served, after that, she seemed to be chatting with other tables and we waited almost fifteen minutes for her to return to our table after eating for her to check on us, during that time we decided we would skip desert and just head elsewhere.  When you are paying over $20 for all entree meals, one would expect not to have to ""hunt"" down the server if they need something, am I wrong? So my issues with this place?  They obviously aren't filling up the place for a reason, maybe it is the fax that they charge $11 for their ""cheapest"" Chardonnay or $28 for a steak with a few hand cut fries or short ribs with two grape tomatoes and two fingerling potatoes?  I understand quality, but quality also has to meet quantity as well.  I bet you if the place lowered their prices a few dollars on everything, added a little more, they would fill the place up easy. Also, make sure their servers know how to keep an eye on their tables."

This place is so convenient to eat at either before you get started at the museums or as a spot to take a break during your visit.

2014-09-06,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Papa’s Pizza & Subs,"Quite an extensive menu, it's gonna take a while to work my way through it. Definitely not a New York Thin Crust type pizza, more like chewy bread.

2014-09-09,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Frank’s Pizza & Italian Restaurant,I have been here a few times. Great pizza. If you are going to eat here plan ahead and order the Sicilian.

2014-09-11,5.0,"Burlington, NC",El Tapatio Mexican Restaurant,Great Mexican food. I was only in town for four days and ate there twice. The salsa and chips are awesome.

2014-09-12,5.0,"South Boston, VA",Cariokos Rotisserie Chicken,Great authentic Peruvian food and rotisserie chicken with great friendly staff.

2014-09-17,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Zoës Kitchen,"I used to go to this place all the time because it's not far from my house and it's on the same block as my church. My previous pastor and her family seemed to really love Zoe's, though honestly it could have been because it was so convenient, as they lived in the apartments above part-time.Anyway, I've tried a couple of different things -- the chicken salad, roasted veggies, and rice -- but the only thing I went consistently to get were those roasted vegetables. (The rest was not at all noteworthy to me, though I am certainly a chicken salad snob.)I don't even like most common vegetables (carrots, zucchini, etc.), but I eat every last piece of veg in this little bowl. It's a bit expensive ($10 for a tall plastic takeout thingy, same size as if you get a ""large"" at a Chinese takeout restaurant), but they're a nice treat.There is SO MUCH oil in those things though -- it drips and runs with it, and there's olive oil pooled at the bottom of whatever container you order it in -- so please DO NOT think that this is a healthy option for you. It's 190 calories and 17 GRAMS of saturated fat in a 5 OZ serving of vegetables... which is exceptionally tiny, that little cup."

2014-09-18,5.0,"Green Cove Springs, FL",Wade Park Cafe,"We traveled through Raleigh en route to Charlotte; missed restaurants in Raleigh so desperately searched for a lunch spot without going out of the way. Yelp popped up with this cafe (sorry, Trip Advisor--we always use you). As we entered this development, I had misgivings that we'd find anything tasty, quick, and reasonably priced.  Initially, all we saw were office buildings---one of which houses this cafe.  We ordered the ""Pick 2"" for $8.75 expecting a tiny salad and mini panini.  Our salad was out in a flash!  Mine was a Cobb and my husband ordered a Chef.  They were large enough to be a meal by themselves.  THEN out came the paninis----far from miniature.  Neither of us could eat ""the whole thing"".  This was right off the beaten path but even if you had to go out of your way to have lunch or breakfast here, it'd be well worth it and you'll be glad you did. I would've given 5 stars if the ""atmosphere"" wasn't a bit on the sterile side but also spotlessly clean."

Left my house and got there right before that mark. I was greeted immediately and with smiles. The guy behind the glass was cutting my pizza into slices when I was paying at the counter. Super nice people are working here which is a big deal to me when I can be served nicely and immediately. It's so awesome not dealing with rude people! Anyway, I took the pizza home and opened the box. Order was perfect and definitely NY style pizza. Not over spicy, just a great Italian flavor. Absolutely yummy pizza!!!

2014-09-21,2.0,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",Saltwater Seafood & Fry Shack,"This seems to be two different businesses at the same location. A fry kitchen and a fish market. I spent 15 years in FL catching deep water fresh pelagic fish and know a little about the industry. Now that I reside up here I was looking for some saltwater fish from a better source than the grocer. First, for those that don't know, that fishy smell is bacteria. Fish basically start breaking down shortly after being caught, via bacteria. Cold and clean handling methods slow this process. From the parking area I smelled 'low tide'.  Inside it was not much better. Selection was OK. They had a surprising amount of small, cheap, whole fish. This tends to be for more ethnic prep. I wasn't willing to part with my money for what I saw, and I'm willing to pay a premium for what I want. Fry kitchen-Oddly, even after the smell, I was hungry. I didn't see much on the menu appealing but figured you can't go too far wrong with a shrimp burger. Fries were great. Shrimp was about brine shrimp size so you get about a hundred but they lack any quality. In short,  glad to see a seafood market in this land locked area. Would like to see a higher standard of prep/handling and a better selection. Fry kitchen... Low quality main dish."

2014-09-23,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",MoJoe’s Burger Joint,"Today marked the first time back at MoJoe's in years and my second visit ever. It's a nice little joint on the corner of Glenwood Ave and Peace St. in downtown Raleigh. I like that I can walk there from work for lunch and it's in a really good area, but parking in general can be difficult since it's a small lot. MoJoe's isn't that big though.A friend and I walked in just after 1 and were able to find a table easily. It's ""seat yourself"" and a very casual environment. Open 11am to 1:30am. There is an open patio, cover patio, small inside dining area, and tiny bar. The cover patio has stars hanging from the ceiling. Adds a nice little touch of magic for MoJoe's. Everything is a la cart and very affordable. Obviously their specialty is burgers, but they also offer sandwiches, salads, and some other items. I had a bacon cheddar burger with a side of cheese fries. My total came to about $9. Everything came out just right. My only complaint, which I didn't bring up because it wasn't a big deal, was my pickles didn't come on my burger and the side of ranch didn't come out either until I asked. The burger was really good and the fries had the perfect amount of seasoning on them.MoJoe's keeps it simple, but good. Nice to have a specialty and do it right while keeping it chill."

SOMETHING HAS GOT TO GO!  And that would be the mariachi trio that wanders the place singing and strumming their guitars.  I have rarely found something as annoying as those guys.  Often the tables/booths are so close together that they stand inside of a normal person's comfort zone as you are trying to eat.  A few of the guys sweat so heavy it's like their pores are creating Vaseline.  And God forbid you have a female at your table for they will never never never never ever ever leave that table for longer than five minutes before they're back serenading that woman!   Once they start up forget about the conversation you were having with your table companion.  And nearby kids WILL start crying.  The mariachi group is the absolutely worst thing about this place and that includes the squadron of Raleigh P.D. cruisers that end up swarming the parking lot once a week.Mariachi has it's place and it can actually lend a credible amount of tradition to certain Mexican establishments.  Just not here.As the Terminator oft says..

The food was really bad though. I barely ate any of the ""A Smattering"" I ordered. Very poor quality ingredients (canned everything!) and it was pretty disgusting. The staff was inattentive. I had to ask for a menu for my friend that they knew was joining me. It took over 20 minutes to get our check; we were sitting right by the register! We were clearly not satisfied but no one cared I guess. This place seems like a nice place if all you are doing is drinking and if you don't mind bad service"
2014-10-08,3.0,"Cary, NC",Piola,"I didn't have high expectations for this spot before coming...I was hoping it would be better than some chain pizza joint and not make me sick. Lucky for me, it was surprisingly good! It wasn't just ""eh, I guess I can eat that"" but it was a spot I thought my 100% Italian grandmother would actually enjoy! (Well, maybe not the atmosphere for her, but take out would be more her speed!) The crusts are thin like traditional Italian pizza. They aren't cardboard hard or anything like that though. A nice crispy crust. The sauce isn't overly seasoned, but it seems to be made from fresh ingredients and not overly salted/spiced to hide strange flavors. The topping combinations are abundant too. You *will* be able to find something here that you will enjoy. All the pizzas are ""individual"" sized too...big enough for most people to split with a friend, or have some leftovers...or a really hungry individual!I also had a tiramisu here. It wasn't light and fluffy, but was pretty dense...a good-sized, decadent piece of cake. There were a few other dessert options too.The service seemed friendly and prompt for me. I'm hoping the few reviews with notes on bad service are a fluke, because this seems like a great spot for some good pizza!"

My only complaint concerns the way they bundle their food - if you're looking to purchase a burger only, you're basically out of luck, as it comes with fries and a drink. It is possible to remove these from the order, but it saves you something comical like $0.20. It's an annoyance, but doesn't necessarily mean I won't be back."

The first time I came was for a Yelp event, and they put on a good show for us all. Great food and good times. The second time I came was just me. I sat at the bar and ordered a hamburger. I know, who comes to a steakhouse, and orders a burger, especially when they don't drink? Well, I will. They have an amazing burger. It is really juicy, and full of flavor. The bartender was really nice, and the food was presented in an excellent fashion.The third time I went, well, it was for the bar burger again. It is only $12, plus it comes with fries, unlike the other high end burger places in the triangle. Plus the burger taste way better than the $15 burger that other places serve. I have had their JUMBO shrimp cocktail, and Filet Mignon also, which I must say were both excellent. The good food and good service make for good times."

I order ""The Boomerang"" which was a spinach dip with mushrooms and cream cheese?....well the spinach look and tasted like something they got out of a can and so did the rest of the food.

My drink was a little to strong..that was the most decent thing I ordered. 4. Lastly, we asked for our checks after only taking a few bites (and I always finish my food but I couldn't for once)...It took a little while to get our checks...we had to ask three different bartenders/servers to finally get our checks.

It's totally okay for kids.I didn't notice any specials on the menu nor did my server tell me of any. I wish there were some cheaper options than just a $8-$9 hamburger. I had a fine experience. I would go back for the pizza, except they charge .95 per topping for an 8in make your-own-pie and $1.95 per topping for a 12in make-your-own pie.

My burger was missing condiments, and had added other random condiments I didn't order. My guy's fries were warm, at best. His burger also had wrong items on it. Wtf?? And for people who this bothers, my burger was completely pink in the middle. I'd call it ""medium.""  (Thankfully, underdone foods are exactly what I""m into -- I had forgotten, actually, to tell them not to murder the burger.)Their onion ring sauce is the bidness. Their sanitation grade (94) -- and glaringly obvious sanitation woes -- are not, thanks.So why do we keep going back, you ask? Well, we honestly forgot that the first two times were retarded.  It had been over a year since the last time, and we were hungry, just having left TPH, who of course does not serve food, and serves beer that tastes like gasoline.

However, I think I was unlucky in the ox tail; it was extremely fatty with not much meat. However, the flavor was delicious. The rum cake was NOT true rum cake; it was merely pound cake with some rum added. As any true Barbadian (or other caribbean person) would know- rum cake is know as black cake for a reason. I still decided to give the rum cake a try though. It was way too sweet, and as someone who loves sugary food, I couldn't even get through more than 3 bites.I'll give Lee's another go around and will order something different the next time I go in.

Where this place lost that 5th star for me was when I ordered my food to go- they just handed me the styrofoam container. I think they should've put the container in a plastic bag and included utensils as well as napkins. Not a huge deal I guess.I liked the fact that you can see exactly how they are preparing your food while you wait. The staff was friendly, the service was fast- but most importantly- the food was delicious.

2014-11-16,5.0,"Franklin, VA",Poppyseed Market,"This place is great! Just went for the first time for dinner. I got the Chevre rol eh which is a goat cheese and pancetta pizza basically. It was amazing and it was like 12 bucks I think for the 10 inch ""personal"" pizza. It was plenty bang for the buck if you ask me. It seems they are well known for lunch in a deli counter set up, but they do dinner after 5 with a wait staff and everything. The lighting is moody. It's pretty great. Highly recommended! I hear the meatball sub is to die for but I couldn't pass up the opportunity for goat cheese pizza. I mean come on!Edit: forgot to mention that they were playing Massive Attack and then Hooverphonic over the speakers when I walked in. That's bonus points right there for that music selection."
2014-11-17,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Cafe Tiramisu,"We are fussy when it comes to good food and this place is consistently great. They have a mature, friendly staff; great wine; and amazing food. Everything we've had (which is most of the menu) is delicious but our favorites are chicken parm with the homemade spinach fettuccine alfredo and the lasagna. The alfredo lightly coats the fettuccine. Lasagna takes about 45 mins but is worth the wait. It's light and balanced with all the classic deliciousness of lasagna. It's not just a cheesy, heavy mess like you typically get. The fried oysters are great as well as the veggie ravioli for an appetizer. Desserts are equally impressive and I'm a cake snob. They are home made and beyond good, all of them. The tiramisu is the best I've had, coconut cake is awesome (and I am not a big coconut fan), and the nutella pie was decadently devine. We love this place and can't say enough good things about it!"
2014-11-18,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",El Tapatio Mexican Restaurant,I love this Mexican restaurant. My husband and I go every Monday night we can when they have $.99 taco night! What a deal and they are good! I like the beef and get a side of sour cream (for like $1.25) so yummy!They also have $1.25 draft beers Monday. My husband and I eat for under $10. Crazy! When we feel like splurging we get the table side guacamole and fried ice cream for dessert.
2014-11-19,4.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",The Square Rabbit,"The Square Rabbit has decent food that is very cheap.  I've gotten a variety of things including the shrimp and girts, and the holiday sampler.  All the things I've had were good, but nothing crazy exciting.  For instance, when I got the holiday sampler it came with a variety of things.  I got greens, turkey with gravy, stuffing and a bit of cranberry sauce.  The stuffing was great, but it's really hard to go wrong with stuffing. The greens were ok, I thought they were underwhelming and could have been more seasoned but they were eatable.  I go to Square Rabbit for comforting food that usually isn't more than $8-9.  Also, the specials change daily, so don't expect the same offered everyday! At 12PM the place is packed, so try to avoid or work around that line.  I went once at 12PM and the line went pretty fast but the place is very small so you're going to cramped in that small space."

Good lemon bars and cookies.The chicken salad sandwich on pumpernickel with sprouts is delicious!"
2014-11-21,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Night Kitchen Bakehouse & Cafe,"Stopped in the new Night Kitchen this morning and first impression was the gorgeous space. Modern, open yet cozy and comfortable. The wide, plank tables and benches would be perfect to work at; though I'm not sure there is WiFi. Second, but not least, the baked goods. The kitchen is wide open and the staff was busy baking and filling the case with pastry and breads. Two of my favorite flavors were represented- lemon and almond. I went with the 'twice baked almond' since it was still warm. Ok, I've heard people say things 'melt in your mouth' but I'm not sure I've ever had that experience, until this almond pastry. Saying it was divine is not enough. The individual bread puddings came out as I was leaving and the staff told me it has been the best seller in the short time they've been open (a genius re-purpose for a bakery that sells loaves of bread). I also picked up a loaf of Gruyere focaccia, which if it tastes as good as it looks, I'll be thrilled. Other notes; Night Kitchen serves a selection of coffees and there's a good amount of parking out front. Seaboard Station has become this interesting, food destination of sorts and Night Kitchen is a perfect addition to the mix."

2014-11-23,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Square Rabbit,"Let me be clear: the day the wonderfully charming Square Rabbit cashier recognized me was the day I ascended to a higher plane of being. The Square Rabbit is a perfect establishment for the downtown working folk among us--something quick, cheap, and tasty! It's a no-frills place, with no place to sit (or stand, really, if you're coming during peak lunch hour), but since I'm always picking up something to take back to the office anyway, I'm not complaining. The menu is an ever-rotating assembly of comfort food, from quiche to soup to chicken-pot pie. It's nothing revolutionary, but it's darn good food for the price. The desserts, however...wow. There's something to write home about. Every dessert I've had here--and let's be real, I've had many!--has been absolutely gorgeous. No butter is scrimped, no sugar is spared, and the result is the best mid-day pick-me-up you're going to get, considering drinking on the job will probably get you fired."

While we mostly go here on Sunday's for pitcher night, it's always a nice, mellow time. Friendly people, friendly staff, and for ""bar food"", it's pretty damn solid. Brunswick stew is always on point, as are the burgers and sandwiches. If I had to choose, I would probably say this is the best bar in Raleigh, in my opinion."
2014-11-26,5.0,"Cary, NC",Anvil’s Cheesesteaks,Great local place with awesome service. Can't find cheesesteaks like this anywhere else! And their Hoagies are good too. Also big fan of the pasta salad.

2014-12-07,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tazza Kitchen Cameron Village,"Let's be honest, Tazza - you had me at overhead patio space heater. Admittedly, I was a little disappointed when I pulled into the parking lot to find Cafe Catura no longer there, but I'm so glad we decided to be adventurous and try out the new resident. Tazza is apparently under the same ownership as Catura, so it had that going for it. Top that off with a great new concept (New American, dinner-centric, creative updates to classic recipes, a bar focused on craft cocktails and a quality beer and wine list) and we have a winner! Because it's gained popularity quickly, we did find there was a wait to sit inside. However, we agreed to take an immediate seat on the enclosed patio, which ended up being a great choice. With both a toasty space heater and strings of Edison lights overhead, I think I actually prefer this atmosphere to the darker interior. On top of the stellar ambiance (did I mention the soundtrack was consistently on point? Hip but homey and never too loud) the food was fantastic. We started with a chunky flavorful guacamole served with homemade tostadas, then moved on to a hearty, Crispy Potato and Arugula Salad and rustic Fish Tacos. Both were unique and impressive. I took half of my salad home as leftovers. It didn't even make it to the next day -  by 11pm I was retrieving it from the fridge and starting this review. Bravo, Tazza! Looking forward to trying your brunch and writing an update soon :)"
2014-12-07,5.0,"Lahaina, HI",Midtown Grille,"I went there with my daughters for the first time today for brunch. LOVED IT. I got the french toast (pain perdu) and my daughters both got waffles (be warned that the waffles have peanut butter, bananas, and caramel syrup....rather heavy but they said it tasted good).  I would definitely get the pain perdu again--so light and fresh and tasty. We got mimosas, which were divine! The ambiance was great, and our server, Erin, was perfect. I thought the prices were pretty good for an upscale place that has a mid-causal fee. I will definitely go back here with my husband for dinner."
2014-12-08,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Night Kitchen Bakehouse & Cafe,"Loving this new addition to our bakery scene here in Raleigh. I stopped by last week to take a glimpse but come on who can walk into a bakery and not order up some of those delicious treats. I ordered the chocolate cork and a cheddar herb scone.Wow that scone was really good it had a bit of sweetness to it but was the perfect savory bite I was looking for. OMG the chocolate cork just run over and get you one or maybe ten. The cork is sorta like a brownie a little more dense and is just sweet enough without being too sweet.  This is by far the cleanest bakery I've ever been to I love how open the space is and that bread wall will suck you right in.There were a lot of people walking in to buy a loaf of bread I need to stop in soon and buy a loaf of bread myself. They also serve plenty of coffee drinks and have two large wooden farm tables inside to hang out at.  There is WIFI just ask the friendly folks at the counter, i did some work while I was here. They also have coffee and espresso drinks I didn't have any on this trip but I'll be sure to drink up the next time I stop in.Be sure to check out this new spot you won't be disappointed."
2014-12-09,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Anvil’s Cheesesteaks,"My fist time visiting Anvil's and I was extremely pleased.  Its located in a small strip mall on the border of Raleigh and Cary.  The location is perfect for me but in the big scheme of things, it may be too hidden away for the masses. I went in on a Tuesday about 11:40am on a rainy day.  This joint has an old school Northeast sub shop feel.  There looked to be about ten tables of which 3 were filled.  It seemed fairly quiet.  I was promptly greeted at the counter and ordered my wife's vegitarian portabello steak and cheese.  Since I never had eaten there before I asked for a recommendation and was told the Steak & Cheese supreme is a winner.  I opted for the hot peppers vs. sweet and had them put the marinara on the side (togo order and I feel the marinara would have made it soggy).  I think is was about $16 and change for the two subs.  When I got home my wife and I tore open the food.  The rolls were wonderful and traveled well.  I tried my wife's sub and we both thought it was really good but could have used a bite more cheese.  The veggies were cooked just right.  As far as my Supreme Steak & Cheese, the wife took the first bite and thought it was awesome.  I took a big honkin bite and was extremely happy as well.  Great balance to this sandwich.  The marinara worked great with this sub and balanced out the hot peppers perfectly.  I am glad I did the sauce on the side because I am confident it would have compromised the sub roll.  We have two good Steak & Cheese places close to us.  I believe this one is the winner but the other place delivers.  We will certainly be regulars at this shop but there are times when delivery will rule.There are two things I would improve on with this establishment.  First, I would add a few more local beers.  Second, I would add some music.  This place was pretty quiet until you ordered food and then is sounded like a friggin Japanese Steakhouse with all the clicking and clanking."
2014-12-10,5.0,"Clemmons, NC",Shish Kabob,"Good people working there. The food is not authentic Lebanese, not even close. It is more Greek...Do not expect to get a Lebanese shawarma or falafel, like you do in Lebanon. Tzaziki sauce is not Lebanese.The location is clean and the guys working there are friendly. That's why I gave it 3 stars."
2014-12-11,5.0,"Spartanburg, SC",Saltwater Seafood & Fry Shack,"Great place to buy fresh seafood brought in from the coast.  The quality is amazing and the prices are reasonable for what you are getting.  Much better than Whole Foods.  A huge selection and if they don't have it, its either not in season or they ran out because it was so good.  Staff is great and very helpful."
2014-12-11,4.0,"Zebulon, NC",Tenko Japan,It was just kinda ho-hum.  I got the hibachi chicken and steak and the steak was a bit overcooked for my taste.  The vegetables were pretty good...nice big chunks of mushroom and onion.  I felt like the meat and veggies could have used more seasoning.  The seafood sauce was average...I've had better at other Japanese places.
2014-12-12,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tijuana Flats,"They really train their staff at Tijuana Flats. I've been to two locations now and I'm always wowed by their customer service. On my most recent visits the cashier even walked me out and held the door for me, it's the little things that really bring a place an extra star! I had my $10 Tijuana bucks from one of our previous events with me which was awesome. You can definitely get a great meal here for under $10.I wish there was a Tijuana a little closer to me because it would be my go to for fresh food fast. I'm absolutely in love with the hot sauce bar I could sit there and taste all day long.  The healthier options they offer here is really what makes Tijuana's stand out against the competition. You can order gluten free or go ahead and get those tacos on a whole wheat tortilla. I got the two tacos one beef and one blackened chicken on whole wheat. My tacos were topped with onions, cheese, tomatoes, sour cream, and REAL sliced jalapenos. The ingredients here are fresh and the tacos are really tasty. I've also had the opportunity to try their flautas, burritos, and churros before which were all delicious. The taco meal also came with chips and I ordered a side of guacamole all for under $9.Tijuana Flats has won me over, I look forward to my next visit."

When the food arrived, I was so anxious to try it that I forgot to pull my phone out and snap a pic.The chicken was absolutely delicious. A crispy and flavorful skin that surrounded moist meat that was far from bland.The chicken was escorted by 2 sides, I went with rice and black beans. The rice was really nice and the beans were not dry. Both were good and I would do them again but I was really all about the chicken today.I will eat here again and again. I didn't try the plantains but the looked terrific."

2014-12-20,4.0,"Atlanta, GA",The Roast Grill,"No Pepsi!  Coke!  No Cheeseburger!! Hot Dog!! 4 items grace the menu of the Roast Grill.  I've only been here once but I've memorized it - Hot dog, coke, baklava, pound cake.  That's it.  Period.  The printed list of what you can't get is longer.  Since 1940, three generations of the Poniros family have been grilling hot dogs from this cramped, spartan location in downtown Raleigh.  Every governor for the last three quarters of a century has eaten here.  Captains of industry have plotted corporate conquests while scarfing down wieners here.  Cops and criminals, rabbis and priests all have munched on a hot dog from the Roast Grill.  And not one of them could get ketchup.   I was in Raleigh with the girls visiting my father when we decided to go to the Roast Grill on a whim.  When we walked in everything went to black and white like a faded tintype photograph - I expected to see Otis in the corner reading the paper or Aunt Bea sitting in her Sunday best, daubing a bit of mustard from the corner of her mouth.     I had two hot dogs and a coke in a returnable long neck glass bottle.  The wieners were charred on the grill, smothered in chili and slaw and topped with diced onions and mustard.  All this was nestled on a plain white bread bun.  There was absolutely nothing special about them.  They were not the best I've ever had.  I did not hear heavenly trumpets blare when I pierced the wiener's skin.  But that's not the point is it.  There may be nothing special about your grandma either but you love her anyway, don't you.  And what the hell do you expect for $5 bucks; the Taj Mafreakin' hal?  Now be gone with you!  We've been doing just fine for the past 75 years without you yelping about us!  Scram!"

2014-12-21,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Night Kitchen Bakehouse & Cafe,"I was so excited that we headed over to KNB yesterday (Saturday) When we walked in no one greeted us even though the place was empty. The first thing I noticed was that they have a vast space which was really nice but the counter holding the baked goods were cramped in front of a cash register. They should've used the space and spread out the baked goods because what you take away with you is how good the food was and not the expensive tables. When we approached the small case we noticed that everything was small and expensive. I hope this isn't the new trend in Raleigh because who wants to pay more than $2 for a bite size thing? We were just too disappointed with the no greet/no meat policy and the doll house baked goods. The breads looked good though and finally a girl came out and looked at us as if she were inside a box office selling tickets to see The Interview. The macaroons looked smaller than a penny and we  just slowly backed away. What is it about places that are not welcoming and charge an arm and a penis for small things? A Cuban Espresso costs .5o cents in Miami, just saying."

2014-12-22,3.0,"Cary, NC",Los Cuates,"I just wanted to clear a few items up as I have seen Los Cuates get some bad reviews, which I think are uncalled for. Firstly, I go to this place weekly, sometimes twice, and have been doing so for over a year now. It's safe to say I have tried almost the entire menu and can give a thorough review. I apologize for the length of this review but I think it is necessary in order to clear the air. I will begin with what is most important, the food. The carne asade tacos with guacamole and pico de gallo are to die for. Tender meat, well seasoned and for just a little over $5, you can't beat it. Their chicken, adobado, chicharron and carnitas are all good. Not to mention, they pack their tacos full of meat! I consider myself a hefty eater and just 2 of these things at lunch is more than enough. If I get the tacos with cilantro and onions then I get 3 because they are slightly smaller. Their shredded beef burritos knock it out of the park! I hate filler items in burritos, i.e. rice, beans, lettuce, etc. If I wanted carbs on carbs then I would just eat a loaf of bread. What you get in a shredded beef burrito is meat, peppers and onions, and pico de gallo, YUMMY! If you get a green chile burrito then it will be pork carnitas and verde sauce, that's it. Speaking of green chile, I eat, literal, bowlfuls of the stuff. I get the green chili plate, minus the rice and beans and it is $5.99 for, well over, a pound of green chile. Their menudo is awesome and for first timers, I always recommend the shredded beef gorditas. It amazes me I don't see more people get these stuffed pockets of heaven. The only thing that I don't really care for from here is their fish tacos. With that said, I believe that all of the other food is so good that I can overlook that fact. If fish or shrimp tacos are your thing then go to Chubby's or the Flying Burrito. As far as the woman at the desk being ""rude,"" as I have seen some people say, she isn't. English is not her first language so she isn't going to have a 5 minute conversation with you. I go there often so she knows me by name. She is really polite, in all actuality. Anything special you want she is more than willing to accommodate you. For example, I love pico de gallo and guacamole with my carne asada fries. If you simply ask, she will give some cups of it at no charge. I also said earlier I don't get rice and beans with my green chile plate and she knocks off $2.50 because of it. In conclusion, she is very nice, just don't expect her to greet you as most Southerners do with a warm welcome. Furthermore, their salsa bar is amazing. This is the only place in Raleigh that actually has HOT salsas. If you don't like it spicy then you may not want to eat here. They have pickled jalapenos, onions and carrots that are made in house and I have never seen any other Mexican place serve (except in actual Mexico). I can eat an entire bowl of just that. They also serve cucumbers at the salsa bar which traditionally is used to soothe the spiciness of food. If you're not getting cucumbers, you're doing it wrong. Finally, someone said ""If this place is so good, and gets all these great ratings, how come no one is eating there!?"" Because restaurants aren't packed everyday, all the time. I was just in there today (12/22/14) for lunch and couldn't even get a seat; I ordered it to-go, instead. Honestly, I have noticed hits and misses when it's crowded and when it's not. Sometimes I go in and it is just me, other times it was like today and I have to take it to-go. I don't think you can judge a restaurant on the fact of how many people were in there at the time you dined. One last note, a majority of the people I see in there are Latino's and if anyone knows GOOD Mexican food, it would be them."
2014-12-27,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bloomsbury Bistro,"I'm still thinking about the meal I had there five days ago.  My parents, boyfriend, and I took advantage of the prix fixe deal for two.  For an appetizer, I had the gnocci.  The poached egg was to die for.  For the main entree, I had the pork loin.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  Service was excellent as well.  If they are running the prix fixe menu deal, I suggest you take advantage of it.  Otherwise, this place is a little on the expensive side to come often.  Definitely a great place to celebrate something special."

It's the rare opportunity to grab a tasty, yet non-greasy, health conscious meal and experience great service, clean tables and fresh food. I've yet to find anything here that isn't good. The salads are filling, the wraps are worthy and all the hummus and chicken dishes impress. It's a great place to bring a family, friends or even hit up solo."
2014-12-30,3.0,"Wake Forest, NC",Aggie’s Grill Station,Food is always fresh and good tasting and well prepared! I personally like less salt on my food but if you tell them they try to meet most of your special requests. Service is kind and informative in the restaurant or on the phone; always very helpful. I love the variety of the food and they have this awesome blooming flower tea! I love how the restaurant is designed with well picked out decorations! Awesome place for dates or just for a quick lunch!
2014-12-30,4.0,"Willow Spring, NC",Chuy’s,"I love this place. It was my first time here and wont be my last. My husband and I were in North Hills one afternoon and decided to give Chuy's a try. The atmosphere is very inviting, fun, and colorful. They have outside seating as well if your looking for some fresh air.We were seated right away in a cute booth. It was 50's theme/dogs. I love dogs so I was thrilled! We got our chips, salsa, and a spicy ranch dip. I thought the chips and dip were great! Best I ever had! I didn't think they were to salty at all like other yelpers said. We also ordered two house margaritas as that was the special for the day. They were great and they have a ton of other options for margaritas. If it wasn't so early in the day I would of tried more. For our entrees my husband and I both got Comida Deluxe which is cheese Tex-Mex enchiladas, chicken flautas, a seasoned ground sirloin crispy taco, guacamole & homemade tostada chips dipped in chile con queso. Everything was delicious including our sides of rice and beans. The portions are huge and very well priced. My favorite Mexican/Tex-Mex place in the triangle.Great service, very friendly! The silverware comes in a package showing that it was cleaned. No water spots. They have deals everyday on food and drinks plus happy hour."
2014-12-31,5.0,"Richmond, VA",The Roast Grill,"There's something special about simplicity. The Roast Grill is my must-go spot whenever I'm in Raleigh. I've been a fanatic of hot dogs since conception, and while I've steered away from them in recent times, I always indulge in a dog done all the way with the works. I'm a big guy and the shop is pretty small, but that makes it all the more enjoyable being shoulder to shoulder with your friends or strangers. While the options are the definition of limited, the tandem running the shop have done an unbelievably wonderful job of making you love what they're selling."
2015-01-01,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Point at Glenwood,"Living in the neighborhood I would love to be able to even like this place. I've given it several chances and it always fails miserably. With the exception of one of their bartenders...the service is pathetic. Pizza is ok, but nothing else on the menu is worth even close to its price. This place is basically a bar for ex frat dudes in their 30's-50's. It's too bad this place didn't care more about the quality of both their food and service. But it's obviously not the case.Won't be back and would not recommend to anyone I know."
2015-01-01,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Borough,"This is an ecclectic bar and restaurant downtown which caters to a diverse crowd.  Good for a drink and a snack, or a full meal.  The menu offers great choices for vegeterians as well as carnivores like me!  We had the macaroni and cheese, a piping crock of thick cheese and soft pasta crowned with bacon.  A great start.  My wife and I both had wonderful meals and will definitely be back.If you like funky and great food, try the Borough!"

2015-01-02,3.0,"Arlington, VA",Moonlight Pizza Company,"After several months we decided to give this place a try after hearing good things. We were impressed by the menu and drink selections, but that was it. We ordered the cow over the moon pizza. The pizza seemed like it was missing something. There was so little sauce on the pizza that all you could taste was the enormous amounts of cheese that was on the pizza. The crust tasted like it had been previously frozen and not fresh. Overall a really disappointing experience based on the reviews and what we had heard. The only plus side is that they have a good drink selection and good service. You can find better pizza at any one of the little pizzas places that pop up in strip malls."

The prices were very reasonable for the product your receiving.  I had the chocolate cork, the chocolate chunk cookie and a cheese croissant. The cork was to die for, super moist with surprise chocolate chips inside. The chocolate cookie was perfect. It was slightly crunchy and not overly sweet just the way I like it. The croissant was light and fluffy and buttery with the perfect amount of cheese. I will definitely be back."

We got their spicy sausage & black pepper honey pizza, cast iron goat cheese, and meatballs.I never thought honey could compliment pizza so well! It made my tastebuds go wild~The goat cheese had a surprisingly nice zing to it- no ordinary cheese here!The meatballs were so flavorful and not like the typical meatballs you'd get anywhere.The brick oven bread that came with the meatballs and goat cheese was amazing! Who knew bread could be so good? It had a crunchy crust, yet a moist center.Service was lovely- our server was nice and she made sure we were happy with everything.Mmm the only ""complaint"" I can think of was that our plates came out one at a time in a 10 minute period which wasn't really a problem for us but it could be for groups.No free refills on sodas but we didn't care because who wants to get full on that when you're here?"

The hibachi is good and lately I've been trying to eat healthier so I've been ordering it without rice (double veggies). I don't like how they automatically assume I want just white sauce so I always have to remember to ask them for extra ginger sauce because they will only give you white sauce without asking. I don't like smothering my hibachi in shrimp sauce. I've never tried the sushi; I'm real picky about my sushi. The spring rolls are great too."

2015-01-08,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Piola,"My husband and I were excited to visit Piola as they advertise Italian style pizza. We've been to Italy many times and thoroughly enjoy the traditional style Italian flat bread pizzas. While the service was great and we had a good time at Piola, the food left something to be desired. When we arrived at Piola, we were promptly seated and quickly greeted by our server, Olivia, who would impress us throughout our dinner. We ordered a cheese and meat board to start. It came with honey and a sweet jam, three meats, and three cheeses as well as three medium sized pieces of toasted bread. It was a lot for two people as an appetizer, and while it was good, there were a few things odd about this plate. First, two sweet spreads are a bit strange. In our experience, one is usually a grain or hot mustard. Also, there was too little bread to support the selections on the board, and the cheese selection was a bit odd: mozzarella, brie, and parmesan. We both agreed that a cheddar or a havarti would have been better that the mozzarella. The meats were all great. My husband ordered a pizza with prosciutto and salami, and I had one with arugula and carpaccio. The outer crust of the pizza was cooked very well, perfectly capturing that Italian style that we really love. The middle bits of both pizzas, however, were soggy, cold, and oily. While I can appreciate adding ingredients after the pizza has been cooked (especially when you have something like arugula and carpaccio), it's not very appetizing if the middle bit is underdone. The Italian thin crust pizzas are always crispy throughout the underside of the pizza - that's what makes them so unique and yummy! We also suspect that the cheese used for the pizza might have something to do with it. It did not taste like a quality ingredient. The toppings were great; we just with that quality was found elsewhere. As we were getting ready to leave, Olivia brought us boxes for our leftovers and more bread for the remains of our cheese and meat board. She was appropriately attentive throughout our dinner and really just a happy, easygoing, delightful server. Piola is lucky to have her. If I ran a restaurant, I would try to poach her! Because the service was good, we might be willing to try Piola again . . . And I might ask for a recommendation on what pizza to get. But I don't know that I could recommend this restaurant to my Italian pizza loving friends. They are trying hard, but from our experience it really isn't Italian pizza."
2015-01-11,5.0,"Holly Springs, NC",The Roast Grill,"I usually don't have a hotdog unless I'm at a football game, but for what's it worth, if you want a unique experience downtown and a quick inexpensive meal, you've got to try this place. A must know going in is that it's definitely a hole-in-the-wall (has been around forever) and offers limited seating. And forget the ketchup because it's frowned upon here. But no need for ketchup because a crispy dog with chili and slaw is well worth it. In fact, you'll want to order two or three depending on your appetite. And I swear, the owner who was making our hotdogs was a reincarnation of Albert Einstein. It was amazing the resemblance."
2015-01-11,5.0,"Washington, DC",Tazza Kitchen Cameron Village,"Tazza is now definitely on the top of my list of favorite restaurants in the Triangle area.The atmosphere is super cute. Love the view of the open kitchen and wood fire oven in the back. There's a decent sized bar area too.Started with the Brussels sprouts and goat cheese dip because we couldnt decide on one! And glad we got both because they were perfect together. The goat cheese was mixed in with a tomato/marinara sauce and came with basically the bread/dough they use for the pizza. It was good! but if you don't like goat cheese, beware that it does taste strongly of goat cheese.I make Brussels sprouts all the time at home so I was semi-hesitant on ordering. but NO... GET IT! SO GOOD! I don't even like bacon but it was amazing! super flavorful and loved the mustard seeds.Of course we had to get the black pepper honey pizza which was delicious. I thought it was comparable to pizzeria toro (my friend says toro is better) but i thought it was super delicious. the sausage is super flavorful, slightly spicy, balancing out with the honey, and the crust was thin and crisp. We were awfully full and couldn't finish everything but had to get dessert of course. Got the flourless orange cake with caramel gelato. I am typically not a fan of caramel, but it wasn't overly sweet which was good. the dessert itself was not super sweet in general which was good after a semi-heavy meal.Overall, service was great. Had to wait about 15-20 minutes for two around 7:30PM on a Saturday night. Everything was delicious and can't wait to go back!:]"

Our hostess was nice and reasonably fast our food came out in no time at all. as i said i got the chicken fajita and my girlfriend got the ""chuy-chunga"". and please forgive me for not remembering what was in it , im not really a chuy- changa kinda guy but i know it came with bean and rice. lolwe finally start to dig in and the food itself was good, i wouldn't write home about it.....so to speak..lolbut i was fairly satisfied.  i will say that the spiciness of the food did kind of overshadow the actual flavor of the dish to which my girlfriend agreed but other then that it was pretty good....just make sure you like spicy food!I think would come back to chuy's and give it another go.

Yes, it was during the lunch rush and the line was almost out the door (always a good sign) but it moved along pretty fast. I had the salad trio of broccoli rabbi, tuna, and wardolf  salads. While checking out I was very curious as to why a pastry treat would need to be called ""Neiman Marcus"" and quickly found out why it is their most popular item. I would give the place 5 stars if it had seating. Great prices. Friendly service."

I have heard many folks speak of this place over the years I've been in Raleigh.  For some reason I just never went in... until the other night.  Pleasant staff, great smells, and the interior is nice and dark which would be perfect for a date night.   The pizza ovens are right in front of you as you reach the counter and you can watch your pie being made, baked and placed in a box right in front of you.  I took a look at the menu and I must say that if the entrees are as good as the price is than I'll be eating here quite a bit.  The pizza came out HUGE!  A bit greasy too but that is exactly what I'd expect.  The crust is excellent as is the cheese and sauce.  It's pricier than one of the chain pizza stores but well worth what you get.I'll be back."

Very fresh crust and the sauce is DELISH. Have tried the meatball appetizer and liked that... But the pizza is what will keep me coming back. If you like thin crispy pizza -- you will love this!

The server explained the specialties for the evening and took our orders. He took quite a while and came back to the table to advise that they were out of one of the specials. He had plenty of time to turn in our order before they ran out. My sister got the cannelloni bean soup and was very disappointed in it. My grouper was fabulous and the Salmon was as well. Waiter took forever to take desert order and the told us they were out of two of the deserts listed on the menu. Overall the experience was ""ok"" and perhaps they were just having an off night.   Somewhat concerned about the sanitation score being a 92 out of 100."

Not sure how busy they normally are at 8:45 but it was raining so that may be why it was easy to get a table.  Hostess was so very sweet and so was our waitress.We were sat in the very back by the bathroom, which I actually appreciated.  Was less worried about my 20 month old ruining other people's breakfast.  Service was really fast and we got our food quickly - which is wonderful when you have a hungry kid in tow.There were so many options on the menu which I love as breakfast is really my favorite meal of the day. I got the veggie scramble which was really yummy.  I wish they still offered the salad as a side, but I settled for fruit.  Loved that they put a good amount of the veggies in comparison to the amount of eggs. My daughter has an egg allergy and they were able to accommodate, which is a huge relief for this Mommy.  We ordered the potatoes and chicken sausage for her which she liked a lot.  The seasoning on the potatoes was great. Sadly, we were told the biscuit has eggs in it so she couldn't have that - but we loved it.  Was very fluffy and perfect - if only the jam didn't have cinnamon in it!!!My husband had the eggs benedict and he was really in heaven. I had a bite and they were SO delicious.  Might have to get that next time!Will definitely be back to try other things. - if only we lived closer!!!"

2015-01-18,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chow Pizza Bar,"Chow has upped their game. We went out for a late-ish supper last night. Started with their fried jalapenos. FRESH jalapenos, sliced, seeded and breaded with a coating that rivals a good fried chicken, fried to crispy perfection and served with a cup of cool sour cream. The jalapenos had some good heat to them too, they were awesome. The beer selections were very good, a lot of local brews and a wait staff that is prepared to walk you through your beer selection.My fella had the veggie ""steak"" and cheese. The ""steak"" was Portobello mushroom. Healthy, chunky pieces of mushroom and roasted red pepper cloaked in melty queso cheese served on a warm club roll. VERY cheesy. He liked it, says the sandwich alone gets a solid 3.5. His side was sweet potato fries, crispy and not greasy, also very good. I had the Buffalo Chicken Biscuit, which was really good. Chicken breast seasoned Buffalo style, with bleu cheese dressing and pickles. A very saucy sandwich, I ate it with fork and knife because I was afraid it would fall apart if I picked it up. That bottom half of the biscuit soaked up a lot of the juices and dressing, and it was awesome. I had a side salad with their house balsamic vinaigrette. The vinaigrette has such a juicy and delicious flavor to it. Chow should consider selling bottles of dressing, it's that good.As a bonus, it happened to be ""Geeks That Drink"" night at Chow, so just for fun, we decided to play. It was a lot of fun. We were total novices, but we didn't come in last... LOL. I could see that being a whole lot of fun with a larger groups. Teams can be up to 6 players. Highlight round for us was ""Chewbacca sings the hits"". So funny."
2015-01-19,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Moonlight Pizza Company,"Last night was my second visit. My first visit was not so great, but I wanted to give it a second shot since my friend said she wondered about it.  We figured a Monday night wouldn't delay our evening (since we had nowhere to be) like when I came here with a different friend a year ago and our order wouldn't be messed up (like last time I came).This time, I was surprised to see that they had taken the larger tables and booths out. It's a large open dining room now. That, coupled with too loud music, does not help the acoustics of a good dining experience. The music choice was odd too. The place is decorated with the moon and stars decor, to mimic the name, but also has a hipster vibe to it (which I like), however the music seemed to come right out of Dirty Dancing or Grease. My friend and I were sitting across from each other and having to speak very loudly to hear each other. To make light of the situation, we began trying to identify which movie each song could be from since it was hard to have much of a conversation or even relax for a low-key Sunday dinner.Service was okay. Our server seemed very unsure of himself. He was very sweet and did get our order just right, but I felt like he was a little timid. He kept asking to refill drinks or pretty much do anything. When I've waited tables before, I have just gone up to the table with the water pitcher. Rarely have I continued to ask to refill water.Our food was very good and we opted to get salad and a pizza because we couldn't make up our minds and (I) insisted on having something a little healthy too. We shared the Chopped Salad. Romaine lettuce, grilled chicken, bacon, avocado, and crumbled Gorgonzola. We had the creamy Balsamic dressing with it. He sent out two ramekins and two large pieces of pita came with it as well. It was served in a large bowl. Definitely worth the $10. I can't imagine how one person could eat that! It was really good though.Then we got the Cow Over the Moon Pizza. At $18 for a medium with this flare, I'd say it's worth it. This pizza is made with housemade tomato sauce, mozzarella, red sauce, meatballs, Italian sausage, pepperoni, Canadian bacon, yellow onions, and white cheddar. We subbed the onions out for some Parmesan cheese. Good call. Delicious balance of meat and cheese. The meatballs weren't huge either. I kept commenting on the unique braided crust. I'm not a crust person, but I ate it just because it seemed to envelop more of the cheese and sauce than most crust does.My friend and I each took leftovers home. I ate my leftover salad and pizza for dinner tonight. I have to say that both were just as good. If I lived downtown, this might be a place I'd go get takeout because I'm not a fan of the noise and on both occasions the service experience has not impressed me."

But I hate to say sometimes it's hit or miss. My first visit here was fantastic. Truly authentic Mexican food, plus $1.99 margaritas. The Chips and salsa they bring out is very good. CHORIZO DIP IS THE BEST IVE HAD! I've had their tacos, fajitas, enchiladas, which all have been very good. But the service, sometimes it's great, the waitstaff will be attentive and you can't even think of something before they are already bringing it to you. But I've had times where I literally had to get up and walk around this tiny place to try and find my waitress just to have the owner help me. Little frustrating when you're scarfing down Jalapeños and you need a refill after waiting 15 minutes, patiently. Other than that I love this place. Owners usually there and is a very nice guy. The food is 5 stars, but the waitstaff needs some work and improvement. This is why it's 4 stars. Give this place a shot."

I ordered the Carolina Cuban. Being from Tampa (where the Cuban was created) I was a little bias. It was okay, but I'd change the name to something else, like pulled pork sandwich maybe. My brother and his 2 daughters were with me and all 3 ate for $20. Not half bad. Kid approved too. The bakery items looked really good, fresh salads, fountain drinks, barista and good portion sizes. Good job guys!"
2015-01-21,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tazza Kitchen Cameron Village,"I just love this place.  Don't know why it's not called ""Lori's Kitchen""!  Quality ingredients done so right.  And not afraid of spice.  Maybe they have a closet I could move into?  Husband asked me where I wanted to go for my birthday, and I did contemplate some of the birthday email freebies that had come my way, but visions of brick oven excellence compelled me to bypass all else and come here.  Let me just say that not being born yesterday means sometimes wise decisions and this was the perfect one!Tazza Brussels Sprouts and Spicy Chicken Wings made for one very happy Birthday Gal...one who refuses to hang her head in shame for requesting to take home a Spicy Sausage & Black Pepper Honey Pizza for day-after-birthday breakfast.  (thanks Husband!)Brussels Sprouts are so full of flavor, and those wings...right up there with the best I've ever had! I have yet to have anything here that wasn't super yummy!  In addition to our fabulous food (Husband devoured his Pepperoni & Peperonata Pizza) our delightful Server helped me find the perfect wine for me!"
2015-01-21,4.0,"Isla Mujeres, Cancún, Mexico",Thai House,We've stopped in here for lunch a few times and the food is pretty tasty.  The service is friendly and efficient so you can get in and out fairly fast.Portions are on the smaller side but I like that - no need to take a to-go bag or eat until I'm stuffed.Tip:  If you like it spicy be sure to tell them because the standard order is not spicy at all.
2015-01-22,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Lee’s Kitchen,It did the job. I got smothered chicken and Mac and cheese with greens. I've had better but this certainly was not the worst. My food took a while which was ok. The lady gave me carrot cake for my wait. It was SOOOO good. I would go back just for the cake. I'll try the Jamaican food next time.
2015-01-22,4.0,"Newport News, VA",The Borough,"Meh. Only reason I gave it two stars was the waitress was fantastic. I would have to be severely inebriated to enjoy any food other than the salad at this place. I loved the vibe this place had, laid back super chill, waitress treated everyone like a regular (most seemed to be). She was fantastic at her job she was doing the bar service and waiting the tables I was very impressed. This is where my love for this place stops....The fries were drenched in stale oil and overly salty seasoning. The wonderful waitress was nice enough to replace the fries due to the salt content saying it was too much for many people; this led to a new batch less salt--more stale oil.Uber Wisconsin, not worth the grease soaked bread and substandard cheeses it was made with :(  The food is the same as you would find at a cheap pool-side snack bar with fancier names."
2015-01-23,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bloomsbury Bistro,"Had a really lovely dinner there last night.  Nice menu, great cocktail.  The service was excellent.  Was nice to be in a restaurant where you could actually have a nice conversation because it isn't loud.  Will definitely go back again."
2015-01-23,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Flying Biscuit Café,"The only thing I can really rave about from this place are their biscuits (which are complimentary haha)To start off, it was a slow evening (with plenty of empty tables) but it took our hostess almost 10 minutes to seat us.I was getting annoyed just standing around so I decided to order a mango martini while i waited.They're 4 bucks, true but they are 4 bucks for a reason. Worst drink of my life. AND it came out luke warm, whatttttt?Anyhow, we got seated and it took our server forever to come to us (and remember, it was a slow evening...)We ordered French toast, buttermilk pancakes, and a side of homefries. Everything was pretty good- nothing really stood out. The French toast was dense and grainy. We drenched it in their honey anglaise to get some flavor on it...Their biscuits were good! Buttery and doughy, yet fluffy~There were little kids sitting behind us and they kept jumping up and down on the booth (which was connected to ours)-I felt like I was eating on a roller coaster.The decor is cheap with bright colors everywhere.Service was pretty slow and unreliable.Very casual place- I think it's more of a late night snacking kind of place. I'd say it's an ihop with some good 'ole biscuits."
2015-01-26,5.0,"Cape Coral, FL",The Daily Planet Cafe,"What a surprise!  My husband and I dropped in for lunch during a day at the museums.  I wasn't expecting much but the Epic French Dip sandwich was outstanding!!!  Flavorful meat, fresh, soft ciabatta roll, horseradish mayo, cheese, savory aus-jus...DELICIOUS!  For $8!!!  My husband had the black bean veggie burger with Brie, sprouts and sun dried tomatoes....with fries and a drink for $10! The staff was so helpful and the manager on duty was very polite. We'll be back regardless if we are going to the museums!"
2015-01-26,5.0,"Charlotte, NC",The Daily Planet Cafe,"Damn! Excuse my French... I was not expecting this in a museum. What I was expecting was overpriced, bland generic food. What they have is totally different. Run by Rocky Top Hospitality, they have a lot of locally sourced items they use in their cooking (eg coffee from Larry's Beans, Bread from Neomonde). Burgers, vegetarian items, fish and chips, fish burritos, sandwiches - quite a selection! Even Grown Up Mac and Cheese with braised short ribs, peppers and onions - so good! Yes it was busy and took about 5-10 minutes of waiting in line, but it was prime time on a Saturday. Off to the right is a coffee bar with everything from Chai to Lattes to some really incredible smoothies. Clean, busy and freindly staff. Nice job!!!"
2015-01-26,5.0,"Durham, NC",Assaggio’s,"A friend and I ordered delivery so I can't speak to the customer service or the atmosphere of the restaurant, but the food was amazing! The fried ravioli were delish-and the marinara dipping sauce was great. We ordered the Antonio-yum,yum, yum! The blend of toppings gave the pizza wonderful flavor! They were also very generous in the amount of toppings they put on the pizza. I am very much looking forward to checking them out again soon!"
2015-01-26,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",O’Malley’s Pub & Restaurant,This place is great for the really cheap beer and the live music...not so sure about the food though.
2015-01-27,5.0,"Bailey, NC",Cafe Tiramisu,Saw this place on yelp and thought we would give it try. We were not disappointed. . The atmosphere  was awesome. Great  for a date night or family. My wife thought it was amazing but a little pricy. Our entrees  were about 17.00 a piece. Not that's not that cheap but considering that u can go to olive garden and easily drop about the same amount for frozen food and premade sauces. This place was amazing the food was homemade and very rich. We are going back this weekend.
2015-01-27,5.0,"Oak Brook, IL",Tazza Kitchen Cameron Village,"Oh mi goodness... I have a new restaurant to add to my list of faves in RaleighEverything about this place is amazing.... the energetic ambiance, the option of outdoor seating, the wonderful service, and of course... THE FOOD!I shared a few items with a friend and everything was pretty out of this world.... The crab cakes came with a really tasty slaw.... the scallops with sweet potato risotto, fried sage, and brown butter were finger licking good... but you guys... the black pepper honey pizza.... I have no words. You just gotta try it. SO GOOD. This is def a great place for a fun date night or a girls night out ! Can't wait to come back"

2015-01-28,3.0,"Diamond Bar, CA",The Square Rabbit,"I was dropping off a package and had decided that I wanted to grab a quick bite. That was one of my best ideas! I decided on the Roast Beef sandwich, which was so yummy! I got everything on it and it was perfect! I paired the sandwich with a can of cheerwine and a chocolate chip cookie. Also, the staff were very friendly and quick at getting the orders together! I will definitely be going back!"
2015-01-28,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Casa Carbone Ristorante Italiano,"Visited tonight for the first time and already relish the thought of a second visit.  I tried the beef braciole and it was tasty.  I want to try the chicken Parmesan next.  The service was excellent and even though the side salad was simple, the house made homemade Ranch dressing was all it needed to make me happy.  Priced reasonably and close to home, will be back."
2015-01-29,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Flights Restaurant & Lounge,"I went to this restaurant for a dinner date with my hunny, and our server Travis was so professional, prompt, and super friendly. The food was very good as well. I would most certainly tell my friends about this place!"
2015-01-30,3.0,"Apex, NC",Babylon Restaurant,"My husband and I dined here during Triangle restaurant week. I was impressed with the menu as they had expensive meals for the $30 price. Our server Tim was phenomenal. He explained the menu items very professionally and was very personable. The owner came by making sure that everything was good for us. The hostess could've been friendlier as she wasn't excited that we did not have reservations. It was pretty empty when we arrived at 5:30, but was pretty crowded when we left around 7 PM on a Friday night. I ordered the lamb roast and it was extremely tender with no bones. It was very well seasoned. My husband enjoyed his beef, also saying it was very tender and well seasoned. The food presentation was very nice and you certainly didn't leave the restaurant hungry. Beautiful decor indoors. Good place for a romantic dinner. Eating outdoors by the pool is also very relaxing On a nice summer's night. The only complaint I had for this evening was loud noises from moving furniture over us. We asked a server about the noise and it was taken care of shortly thereafter. Will be back as their menu is authentic and food quality is great. There are vegetarian and gluten free choices as well."
2015-01-31,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Red Pepper Asian,"My typical reaction normally would have been ""Ah, a restaurant in a crappy shopping center in a lackluster semi-industrial area of Raleigh - so what?"" But I would have been dead wrong.Red Pepper Asian does not disappoint - the interior was attractive and intimate, and the service was prompt and courteous. My food was excellent. Had a vegetable spring roll along with Kung Pao shrimp. Both were great (wish the kung pao had been a bit spicier but the peanut sauce was delicious). There also is an authentic Chinese menu on the back that I want to come back and try. Sadly, all the way over in East Raleigh, but if you're in the area, this could easily be the go-to spot for Chinese. Well done!"
2015-01-31,5.0,"Sanford, NC",The Roast Grill,"George is a master at the art of making great hot dogs.  He and his mom are so friendly it makes you feel like you're with old friends.  The place hasn't changed in 75 years, and no one wants it to.  They make the best chili dogs anywhere, hands down."
2015-01-31,1.0,"Apex, NC",Babylon Restaurant,My husband and I ate here last Saturday as we were celebrating our 1st anniversary. We had an intimate wedding party with our family the night of our wedding at Babylon a year ago and we wanted to revisit in honor of the night. We got dolled up and made a reservation thru yelp since no one would return our phone calls from the restaurant. We were hoping for a special treatment  to remember the night but were placed in a crammed crowded loud corner of the dining room. The menu seemed very similar to when we were last there. However the pizzas were a new addition that I didn't remember. We had a bit of an issue with the sodas. Evidently one of the sprays was recently adjusted and the flavor of the sodas came out tasting like a diet flavor. We ordered grilled bodega lamb skewers as an appetizer which tasted too fatty for me.  The dipping sauce had a really nice spicy that I actually saved and used on the meat of our entree. We also had a teaspoon-size of complementary hummus & loaf bread as we looked over the menu. I ordered pizza for dinner-not what I was expecting for my anniversary & we also had the chicken tagine. We decided not to have dessert. But the waitress was pleasant & willing to capture the event for us. I would like to think we'll continue visiting for every anniversary. But it's doubtful.
2015-01-31,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Thai House,Food is great and always consistent.  $ 6.96 for cup of soup with SHRIMP????  A bit much considering the Entree's are around $8-9.  We go for the soup and have to bite the bullet on the price.
2015-02-01,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Cafe Tiramisu,"Have eaten here several times and we love it! Have always had good service, and fresh incredibly good food! One of our ""go to"" restaurants when we want to impress out of town guests"
2015-02-01,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Taza Grill,"The service is excellent  with a warm greeting always.   The lamb gyros  are always made with fresh ingredients.  The ""boss""  likes this place!"
2015-02-01,3.0,"Cary, NC",Tacos Y Mariscos Vallarta,Some of the worst service ive ever recieved. Never once did anyone check back with us to see if we needed refills or boxes or anything!  I watched while everyone else around us was treated wonderfully but we had to pull people aside to ask for everything. Not cool! I would like to say ill be back to try again but since im moving to another state in a few days it probably won't happen.
2015-02-02,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",El Tapatio Mexican Restaurant,The chicken pasta top with avocado is my wife's favorite. You can't beat chip & salsa with take out.
2015-02-02,5.0,"Cary, NC",The Roast Grill,AWESOME !!!!   The best hot dog I have had in the Raleigh area.  The chili is da bomb.  I wish they could figure out how to make the place a little bigger.    It's worth the wait.  YUM !!!
2015-02-03,5.0,"Wilmington, NC",The Daily Planet Cafe,"I came here after touring the museum on Super Bowl Sunday. Not a lot of folks eating, so I had the place mostly to myself.  The staff was super friendly and pleasant. I ordered the chicken cordon bleu sandwich and I have to say: I think it may be the best sandwich I've ever had! I told one of the employees that even though I live in Wilmington, I would come back to Raleigh just for that sandwich.  This place is a definite must when you're in downtown."
2015-02-03,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Square Rabbit,"Finally went here for a late lunch today.  Not too sure I'm sold on this place.  I had one of the specials: German steak & potatoes.  There were MANY pearl onions, a few potatoes, lots of green beans, and some really TOUGH steak.Maybe I needed to have tried a sandwich instead.  That said, it's fairly quick and inexpensive.  I was there after the lunch rush, though.I may try it again, but I'm not in a huge hurry to do so."
2015-02-03,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Piola,"It's still not NEW HAVEN, CT.... Like Pepe's, Sally's nor Modern.....   But it beats anyone else's I've had here in NC.   Traditional menu, like Sausage, Peppers and Onions has to be ordered outside of the menu as the menu doesn't really have ""traditional"" listings....   But it look like you can order them.   The only part i'm not crazy about is Red Onion on a sausage, pepper and onion pizzas....   It should be, in my opinion, vadalia's  or yellows..... Definitely NOT RED....    I'll give them 3.5 out of 5 gold forks."
2015-02-03,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Cameron Bar and Grill,"I look for a place where I can get something vegetarian and still satisfy my favorite omnivore.  Cameron Bar and Grill fits the bill. All the burgers can be built as a hamburger, a grilled chicken, or a black bean burger.  I have tried the Atlanta (pimento cheese, fried green tomato, a dash of hot sauce) and the Charleston (pickled fried green tomato, goat cheese, herb aioli), both as a black bean burger.  Their pimento cheese and fried green tomatoes are delicious.  Bela enjoyed a beef burger the one time and a chicken sandwich the other and found both satisfying.  For sides, the hot chips, red skin potato salad, or fried pickle chips are really good and the jalepeno mac & cheese is divine. Relaxed atmosphere.  Friendly service.  A pleasure.  A great place to go on the way to Raleigh Little Theatre or Theatre in the Park."
2015-02-04,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Aggie’s Grill Station,"I really want to like this place, but my recent visit leaves me as confused as my visit in July of 2013.  The name doesn't match the menu.  The decor is - - - I dunno.  Asian-Euro-Metro?  It is nice decor but it really is an odd mix.  And what's with the showcase of jewelry, purses and toys in the display case as you enter?My guest ordered a cup of coffee with her meal.  When we asked for a refill the server explained that they have specialty coffee and as such no free refills.  Free coffee refills is the norm in this area, and having to pay for a refill was a definite negative to our dining experience.Having said that, the hamburger my guest ordered and the sub that I had were both of ample size and good taste.  Server was conversational and friendly.I have eaten here twice and had the same thought both times - Robert Irvine (Restaurant Impossible) would have a field day with this place!"
2015-02-04,5.0,"Kensington, MD",Cameron Bar and Grill,"I had the Death Valley burger here, with waffle fries.  The burger was pretty tasty--spicy, but not as spicy as I expected something with ghost peppers to be.  Came medium rare, as requested--good.  Fries were pretty good too.  One dining companion had the cheesesteak, which looked pretty messy--cheese whiz everywhere.  But it was allegedly very good."
2015-02-05,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Got to Be NC Competition Dining,"First off, I have to thank yelp for these tickets! This isn't an event i'd usually attend (because of the price) but I am sooooo glad I was able to! Got To Be NC Competition Dining has a huge following in the Triangle and i've heard great things about it from the people I work with so I was very excited and nervous going in. They don't tell you the secret ingredient of the night until you get there so I was crossing my fingers that it wouldn't be carrots or chocolate (I know, what kind of freak doesn't like chocolate! Me. I'm so weird)-Well guess what. The secret ingredient was chocolate....Though more specifically it was cocoa nibs; the bitter flakes that chocolate comes from...It's like the reject icky cousin of what we know as chocolate. Needless to say I was more than a little worried I wouldn't have a dish I liked. Fortunately those chefs in the back worked some major magic and somehow incorporated those nibs into every dish pretty much flawlessly. The only dish I could even taste chocolate in was the desserts which may have not been the point of the competition (after all one of the judging points is how well the nibs were used in the dish) but amazing luck for me! Service during this event was perfect, there were wait staff circling the room to full glasses before they were empty and to office another beverage or clean utensil. They were so eager to provide good service that one of the waitresses accidentally took my plate while I still had a few bites left (granted I was looking down at my phone, voting on my meal). Despite this I was extremely happy with the service!My only complaints about this event (other than you better not be a vegetarian!) were that the tables are extremely crowded with ten seats around and that the event is VERY commercialized. Everything has a sponsor and they have to name them off several times through the night. It interrupted our conversations and seemed sorta intrusive and annoying near the end. If you can ignore those two issues (which come with events this popular) I am sure you will have an amazing time with this dining experience!"
2015-02-05,5.0,"Wake Forest, NC",Lee’s Kitchen,My favorite Jamaican spot! Great food but it's only take out. A very busy place but still friendly atmosphere. The best oxtails & jerk chicken!
2015-02-05,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chuy’s,"I stand by my extreme like for this place, as does Husband (who requests to go often).  Our big like always includes sitting in the bar area...we have been lucky to almost always get a comfy booth there.  Made especially likable when we do so during the 4-7 free nacho bar time!My consistent fave here is to get one of their awesome chile rellenos combined with one of their awesome enchiladas (I love the veggie one).  I like a spicy kick, so my sauce choice (and how many places give a choice???) is the Hatch Chile one.  Husband is a burrito kinda guy and is always happy with that here.

2015-02-06,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Poppyseed Market,"A group of eight of us had dinner at Poppyseed Market on a week night. My dish was good, but not great. I had the butternut squash lasagna which is topped with a ""creamy four cheese sauce."" The dish was drenched--overpowered by--the cheese sauce. I love cheese, but this was a little much. The lasagna was good, but not $15 good. I would have preferred the noddles to be closer to al dente. Instead, everything in the dish was the same consistency (mushy). My salad was fresh and tasty, and everyone else at the table was happy with their food. I'll give Poppyseed another try, not in a large group, and see if maybe I ordered the wrong thing or hit it on a bad night."
2015-02-06,4.0,"Madison, WI",Cristo’s NY Style Pizza,"This place is so cute! I was craving pizza after a long day of work and am thankful that I followed my Yelp nose to this place. It's small and cozy - and I love the tiny bar up front. They had some really interesting beers on tap that I had never heard of before, and I thoroughly enjoyed my selection! For my pizza, I ordered the Grandma's to go and it was super yummy. Everything tasted really fresh, I loved the addition of the fresh basil. I think my pizza was done in about 15-20 minutes, but it could have taken longer and I wouldn't have cared (thanks to the yummy beer I was drinking)."
2015-02-06,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Cristo’s NY Style Pizza,Friendly service and quick turnaround on a pickup order. I thought the pizza was pretty close to NY style and I would return here again to order food for our office. Is pretty reasonably priced as well. If you order a topping like pepperoni they dont put a ton on your pie so ask for extra if you want a decent amount. The rest of their menu has some interesting italian food offerings that I would come back and try.

2015-02-08,5.0,"Cary, NC",The Point at Glenwood,"First time for each in our group of four.  Overall the food was very good, the service was good, the prices were very reasonable, and the parking was tough.........but the Five Points area is like that for most of the businesses there.  The server was very prompt with getting the table set for our reservation, getting water and getting drink orders.  Since we were all first timers we grilled him a bit on the favorites, and he was very knowledgable about the menu, and very helpful.  We all ordered something he recommended.  Started with the BBQ wontons - really good and next time I won't share mine!  Salads were good, nothing to rave about, but how often do you go someplace to eat their salads anyway?  I had the yellow tail tuna over jasmine rice.  It was cooked perfectly, the rice was really good, but I would have like a little bigger serving.  I need to lose 10 pounds so it was probably better that way!  The steak medallions got a rave from one of us, as well as the salmon, and the flounder in parchment.  The wine and beer selection was very good also, with two getting a craft beer on tap, and the other two getting wine.  Definitely a very good experience for our first time and will definitely repeat, maybe trying to get in some, music next time, along with one of those awesome looking pizzas coming out of the wood fired ovens."
2015-02-09,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Players Retreat,"I cannot say enough great things about this bar and restaurant.  Best burger in Raleigh.  What's more, they serve food late into the night! It gets busy early for sporting events, but it's worth it!!"

The pizzas were so much more expensive and much worse quality. The flavors were gross ( had the buffalo chicken pizza and one other I can't recall) and the cheese and toppings slid right off the thin, slimy crust.Do yourself a favor and go to Trophy's instead. ALWAYS."
2015-02-10,3.0,"Clayton, NC",The Players Retreat,"This place used to be great.BUT, they have raised the prices about every 3 months for a couple of years now and it is no longer great. It's OVER PRICED!If you are going to pay top dollar bar prices you might as well go to a nice, new bar that is not 50+ years old and has not been remodeled ever. Sorry PR.

I asked if they were pre made or made fresh and the waitress told me they were fresh... ok great then I will have mine with NO Onions... The waitress said NO, we wont do that!  I thought this was strange but figured maybe she meant they were made fresh daily (as samosas are pre done sometimes)  so I just got one.  Then when it was time to order the main dishes once again (most of their dishes have onions) we asked for our dish to be made with NO Onions.  The waitress said NO we wont do that (not cant but wont!!!) authentic Ethiopian is made with Onions, but you can order another dish that is not made with onions in it!!!   I am sorry but what if someone was allergic???  I am not but I am sure as heck not going to eat something I nor my boyfriend like in my food, especially just because someone refuses to just simply LEAVE THEM OUT!!!  I even had her go ask the manager (who would have come over them selves to see what is wrong in any decent establishment) but just sent her back with the same answer ... so we got the check and paid for the one Item we got and left!!!  Never have I been told what will be in my food and I have no choice in the matter... so I took option B.... leave...

Grits, sesame bread, Spanish cured meat, tomatoes, feta, 2 eggs. I was also particularly hungry this morning- but my partner loved it too! We also had the fried chicken hollandaise- one of the signatures here. Wonderful tri colored potatoes.They open early at 6am & that's a plus for us.Good for early risers with hungry tummies!"

I ended up going with the salad- good choice! You choose your greens, then your protein and the remaining add ons. All items were fresh and you have a lot of items to choose from, different cheeses, veggies and even almonds, walnuts etc.. I was really happy with the salad and the service and will definitely go back the next time i work in Raleigh."

2015-02-14,5.0,"Woodbridge, VA",Babylon Restaurant,"My husband took me to Babylon yesterday for our Valentines Day dinner and here is what I thought:1. It's winter time so we weren't able to sit outside. The inside of the restaurant feels very cozy and warm, a romantic place for couples or out with friends. 2. Food was good not recommended for a cheap dinner though. Don't recommend the tapas as the name says it's tapas (small plates) and if you are new to it you might come to a surprise. Drinks in the other hand were very small for the price. 3. Seating: most of the tables are close to the wall which they have a built in bench seating. This  was very uncomfortable, I had to Switch seats with my husband because my back was hurting bad. So FYI if you have back problems you might want to request a chair not the bench seating. Also it's winter and they didn't have a rack or a hook for your coats so you either sit on top of your coat or put them on the floor.4. Last, service was great! Our server was very tentative and was very knowledgeable about the menu ( great for newbies like us). I  do will like to go again but in the summer time. I'll write a review then. Happy Valentines Day all!"
2015-02-14,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tacos Y Mariscos Vallarta,Good place to get your late night Mexican fix at and they carne asada was pretty good. I also got the tripa tacos which were ok although I didnt care for the chorizo. They had a mariachi band setting up which we werent late enough to be around for but I will definitely have to come back to check that out. Its a good late night place but theres other options close by during normal house.
2015-02-14,5.0,"Durham, NC",Abyssinia Ethiopian Restaurant,Went to Abyssinia for lunch.  We ordered the meat platter and Abyssinia Chicken Tibs. The injura was good but the meat curries were just OK. We could taste the raw turmeric powder in the Chicken tibs. The turmeric wasn't cooked well. It is good to experience a different cuisine but the portions are pretty small for the cost(45 for all the food in the picture and 2 drinks) and the ambiance. I would not recommend this place for any occasion or if you are too hungry. Every dish resembles an Indian curry but the Indian curry has a fullness or a complete blend of spiciness to it. The waiting staff is nice and friendly.
2015-02-15,5.0,"Charlotte, NC",Papa’s Pizza & Subs,Great food. Very fair prices and friendly service. Small venue but nice and clean.  Got the 2slice and a drink for $5.  Great price for big slices.   We'll be back.
2015-02-15,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",El Tapatio Mexican Restaurant,I've been meaning to update my review. El Tapatio has improved tremendously!  They added more menu items and the food and drinks have improved overall. They have great specials every day as well. I would venture to say this is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Raleigh!
2015-02-15,4.0,"Arlington, VA",Sullivan’s Steakhouse,Sullivan's is overly accommodating. Super nice employees providing super great service.  It's got great vibes and seems to always be alive when I visit. I believe there is live bands on Thursdays with good drink specials. Knockout Martinis are to die for.  Mushrooms as a side dish are delicious.
2015-02-16,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Poppyseed Market,Food was good; a bit pricey for what you get.  My friend's pimento sandwich looked a little gross - too much cheese compared to size of bread.
2015-02-16,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mo-Te Vietnamese Restaurant,"Yum yum, what a great little Vietnamese restaurant! We went to Mo-te at 7 on a Sunday night, and were not undeterred by 1) the fact that the heating was turned off and it was 25 degrees outside and 2) we were the only people there.We feasted on pork spring rolls, Viet coffee, Taro bubble tea, combination pho and bbq plate. Everything was fresh and made to order, and the couple making the food were nice. I found the spring roll sauce to be extremely salty and would definitely have preferred the shrimps rolls had there not been a shrimp allergy in the party. The pho a bit sweeter than normal, but it was also my  fave in the triangle so far because you could smell the spices in the broth. The bbq pork was cooked and flavored extremely well.Oh and, we had never before drank viet coffee, and were impressed by the strong, rich flavors. All in all, the food is definitely worth it, as we paid only $30 and everything was freshly prepared. Just don't expect your typical dining experience and you'll enjoy :)"
2015-02-17,4.5,"Raleigh, NC",Got to Be NC Competition Dining,"We really enjoyed the NC Competition Dining and can't wait to go again. It is a truly unique experience dining experience at a fantastic price point.Things you should know before you go:You will be seated at tables of 10 and the room is packed tight. This is not a romantic, six course dinner for two. It is like attending a wedding with really good food where you don't know anyone else. But, you are all there because you love really good food and that gives you so much to talk about. We had a great time with the folks at our table and it appeared everyone around us did too.You will eat late on a school night. The first course starts at around 7:30pm and finishes up around 10pm. It's just the nature of the event. Thankfully there's spacing between each course.Each table has a server and the service is excellent. A full bar and local brewers and spirit drink specials are available throughout your meal.It is busy. There are a lot of people in the room, an MC introducing chefs and sponsors. Others have complained that it is very heavy on sponsorship and we agree, but if that's what it takes to pull off this fun event, it is fine with us!You will have no idea what you will be eating until you get there, so if you are picky, vegetarian  or vegan, this is probably not the event for you. If you love trying new, super creative flavor pairings, you will love Competition Dining.You will use your smart phone to judge each course. You will download an app (there's an IT guy circling the room to help) and go from there. The app is very user friendly and allows you to take screen shots of the ingredients so you can remember dishes later.Get tickets early- it sells out!"
2015-02-17,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Pearl Chinese Restaurant,"Surprisingly there aren't many Chinese restaurants that delivery near my boyfriend's house so we settled for take-out on a lazy Saturday evening. I volunteered to go pick it up and was told a reasonable amount of time till our food would be ready (15 minutes).  I left with the intention of walking in after it had been 15 minutes which was a mistake and left me waiting an additional 5 minutes in the restaurant. Which is my fault, I was overly eager for food!As I waited, I looked around and it was really dim inside and almost seemed a bit dirty but that could have been the lighting and the table I was sitting at which wasn't clean. I will admit that I was excited for my food once I saw there were a good amount of people dining in. It was a good mix of groups of people so I was hoping it would be worth the drive out there and back. Once my food was ready, I quickly drove back to eat the Chinese goodies and they were good for take-out food. I'm pretty easy to please when it comes to Chinese take-out but I always appreciate when extra condiments are in the bag and ready to go which Pearl did. I ordered the general tso's chicken (my usual) and appreciated that they actually had a bit of a kick to them. I love spice and heat and most places advertise this dish as hot but never deliver. Now, just to clarify, it wasn't the heat I wanted but with a bit of sriracha I was good.I'm disappointed there aren't any nearby Chinese restaurants that deliver, but the next time I want Chinese I'll make the drive out to Pearl."
2015-02-17,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Point at Glenwood,"I think this place has by far the best pizza in Raleigh...the cheese is delicious, the crust is perfect (not soggy at all) and it does not get weighed down by the yummy toppings.   We ordered it for a large party and everyone raved about how delicious it was. We do take out and also dine in.  The service is not great, but the food makes up for some of servers."
2015-02-18,5.0,"Clayton, NC",The Players Retreat,"I can't believe it has taken me this long to grab lunch at the famous PR.  It was worth the wait.  Service was efficient and friendly.We all had burgers.  It's nice to get them cooked the way you want. Mine was  a perfect medium rare, nice an juicy.  They have a nice selection of toppings.  I had a side of onion rings and they were a bit over cooked.All in all, a pretty good stop for lunch."
2015-02-19,5.0,"Durham, NC",Alpaca Peruvian Charcoal Chicken,"I am no expert on Peruvian cuisine, but the rotisserie chicken here is really fabulous.  Every bite is juicy and the meat falls right off the bone.  They provide yummy dipping sauces, and a nice spread of sides.  My partner and I really like the sweet plantains and the chicken soup, which tastes like it's home-made!  We've also tried the Peruvian style fried rice (Arroz Chaufa) and it was delicious too.  Everything is fresh, and made from scratch.   On top of all of this goodness, the food is really cheap too (a full meal for under 10 bucks).  Cheap, simple, fresh, very tasty...it's hard not to go with five stars for this place!  Oh...there is an outlet in Durham too, if you live there."
2015-02-19,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Alpaca Peruvian Charcoal Chicken,"Delicious, affordable, fresh, great quality, friendly service yet efficient. Not done of ambiance or atmosphere. However, this place is a jewel! I haven't been to the one on Wake Forest Rd. but no need now that this one on Capital Blvd opened. I for see it staying open and bringing business to mini-city area for years to come. Can't wait to visit again!"
2015-02-20,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Thai House,"I have eaten dinner and gotten takeout from Thai House multiple times over the course of the last two years. I cannot recommend the chicken massaman enough! I've never been disappointed in their service or food, but I have noticed that they sometimes give me the wrong spiciness level."
2015-02-22,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Night Kitchen Bakehouse & Cafe,"Pretty good baked goods. I liked the bread pudding, which was more like a popover than any bread pudding I've ever had. It was okay, but nothing I would need to have again. My wife had a gruyere croissant that she thought was quite good. A little bit of an odd space, with a lot of emptiness and a very small case for baked goods. Would have to try more things before I could really recommend it to anyone, but it was a good first impression."
2015-02-22,5.0,"Apex, NC",Oakwood Café,"Meh. I was excited to have some tasty Cuban food, but what I ended up with was average.  I ordered the picadillo and I've had better. The seasoning was just lacking for a normally very flavorful dish.  The side of black beans and rice were pretty standard.  With that being said, the plantains were delicious!!!  The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful, which was great!"
2015-02-22,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Randy’s Pizza,"Our favorite spot to get take-out from!!!!  The subs are phenomenal and so reasonably priced.  I highly recommend the meatball parm and the chicken philly.  They're big enough to save half for the next day and they don't skimp on toppings like most places.We got one of their ""extra large"" specialty pizzas (had chicken, jalapeños, bacon, pineapple) and weren't too impressed.  If I got pizza again I will just stick to pepperoni because the last one wasn't memorable and seemed overpriced.  Not enough sauce or more importantly, toppings, for a 'za of that price and size.Try not to modify your order too much, attempted to add mushrooms to a sub twice now and have been charged for them both times without actually receiving them on my food.  Regardless, Randy's is my take-out savior!!"
2015-02-22,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",ORO Restaurant & Lounge,"Oro never disappoints! 8 of us had drinks and dinner there last night. The food was DELICIOUS, and the service was wonderful. I can't wait to go back!"
2015-02-23,5.0,"Durham, NC",Red Pepper Asian,"I always get lost coming to Red Pepper (it is located in a weird shady looking strip mall), but the food is worth it!  Everything my partner and I have tried is delicious!The trick is to order the Chef's specialties, which are authentic Malaysian/Singaporean/Asian food, instead of ordering from the Americanized menu (which is really poor in my opinion).The paper-wrapped chicken, Singapore rice noodles, Chow fun and Pad see ew are our favourites.  Only minus is that the food is slightly greasy."
2015-02-23,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chuy’s,"Went on a Monday just about noon for lunch.  Enjoyed the colorful entrance and was promptly seated. Nice decor with lots of ""family"" photos and bright colored walls.My guest ordered the Chuy's Special EnchiladasAn authentic New Mexican recipe. Homemade blue corn tortillas stacked with freshly-roasted, hand-pulled chicken, cheese & Tomatillo sauce, topped with sour cream (info from the website)  I ordered the Custom Enchiladas with ground sirloin and their Deluxe Tomatillo sauce.Our meals were delivered sizzling hot and with a minimal wait.  Loved the flavor of my dish.  Great flavor without heat - as I prefer.Thought the price point of the meals was reasonable."
2015-02-23,2.0,"Knightdale, NC",Abyssinia Ethiopian Restaurant,"Amazing food, and amazing dining experience! The food comes out on a large metal dish, with each serving in a tiny mound atop their yummy injera bread. It's meant to be eaten with your hands, specifically your right hand (using left hand to eat is considered impolite). It takes a minute to get used to, but you get the hang of it quickly. My boyfriend is Indian and grew up eating this way, so he was able to give me some tips. You basically tear off a piece of the bread (harder than you'd think with one hand), and use it to scoop up one of the dishes.We ordered the meat combination with Doro Wat (chicken), Yebeg Wat (lamb) and Yebeg Alicha (lamb), and the Abyssinia Chicken Tibs. For sides, we got collards and lentils. The lentils were just ok, but every other dish was spectacular! My partner and I were both smiling throughout the entire meal!I will say, the portions seem quite small for the price, but we had a gift certificate, so it didn't really matter to us. We also left completely full and satisfied. Regardless of the price, we are definitely coming back here! The food was tasty, fresh, and had that unique made-with-love/grandma's kitchen quality to it."
2015-02-23,5.0,"Durham, NC",Abyssinia Ethiopian Restaurant,"My partner and I visited this place over the weekend.  It was our first time trying Ethiopian food and we were quite simply blown away by the food.We ordered a mixed meat platter, which came with chicken and two varieties of lamb, to which we added lentils, collards, and a serving of Chicken tibs.  All of the dishes were served on Injera bread, the Ethiopian version of Indian dosa, or western crepe.We loved everything.  Someone mentioned that they tasted raw tumeric in the Chicken tibs, but we didn't.  Our chicken tibs were delicious and spiced all the way through.  All of the curries were really delicious.  I can see the resemblance to Indian food, but they are spiced quite differently and more mildly.  The Injera bread was also really tasty.I suppose our only real gripe is the price of the food for the serving size... the portions are small, but the Injera bread is really filling.  If you go to restaurant.com and get a deal you can shave off $15 from your check and it makes it much more affordable.We could tell that the food here was prepared with pride and we left feeling very satisfied.  We will definitely be back!"
2015-02-23,5.0,"Durham, NC",Sawasdee Thai Restaurant,"My partner and I have been here several times for dinner and we've never been disappointed.  The food here is definitely very authentic and well prepared.The appetizers are really good!  The shrimp cakes, fish cakes, and chicken satay are what we usually get.For entrees, the Drunken noodles and Pad Thai Woon Sen are our go-tos.  The flavour in them is incredible!  We also like the Crab fried rice, which tastes very fresh and light, and has nice chunks of real crab (not crabsticks)!They have a warm coconut pudding which is our favourite dessert there.  The staff are also very friendly and the service is fast.  Definitely check this place out if you love Thai food!"
2015-02-24,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Saint Jacques,"First, the only thing taking this review from 5 stars to 4 stars is the space.The services and food were absolutely incredible - no complaints here, only praise.The small things were so thoroughly thought out:As soon as I sat down, the waitress noticed I was wearing a black dress and was kind enough to go get me a black napkin without me having to ask, so that the white wouldn't clash with my outfit. As soon as I opened my menu I was also surprised at the old-school move to give me a menu with no prices, whereas my boyfriend was given a menu with prices. Such a classy, old-school touch. Just made you think ""wow"" they are so thorough in trying to ensure that this meal is special, and that they care.Everything from the amuse bouche, the incredible entrees (I had the duck, and it was mouth-watering), the dessert, and the wine services was spot-on. Their sommelier was incredibly helpful at helping us select a wonderful bottle that paired nicely with out entrees.Again, everything was fantastic, but the fact that this spot sits in a strip mall right next to a Harris Teeter is a shame -- what a WONDERFUL restaurant. I wish this would move to a flashier/classier location closer to downtown more worthy of service and food. It is now one of my favorite restaurants in Raleigh."
2015-02-25,3.0,"Durham, NC",Alpaca Peruvian Charcoal Chicken,Great food friendly people chicken is really really good and the sauce is amazing!!!!
2015-02-25,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Despina’s Cafe,Really friendly service and great food. Had a wonderful spanikopita for lunch.  Great flavor and lots of spinach. All the pastries look wonderful. The atmosphere is inviting if you want to stay awhile and the free wifi is convenient.  I will definitely be going back.
2015-02-27,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Aggie’s Grill Station,I eat here all the time and their food is delicious every time. Great customer service. Their food selection is very versatile and diverse. I recommend this place for anyone looking for a restaurant that is top notch at a value price. Keep it up
2015-02-27,4.0,"Columbia, SC",Anvil’s Cheesesteaks,Closest thing to a real Italian Hoagie in the Raleigh area. Can't wait for our next visit!
2015-02-28,5.0,"Morrisville, NC",Lee’s Kitchen,I love this place. I have tried everything and have never been disappointed. My favorites are the Brownstew chicken and the smothered turkey wings. The collard greens and Mac and cheese are the best around this area. You have to catch the potato salad because it sells out quickly. I love the red velvet cake it tastes very similar to my mom's recipe. I don't think you can go wrong with any meal here. They are a distance from me which is a good thing because I would probably go daily. They also have a food truck that has been in the Morrisville area lately. Check out their facebook page for details.
2015-02-28,3.0,"Durham, NC",42nd Street Oyster Bar & Seafood Grill,"I haven't actually been back to 42nd street to eat lately, but felt the need to do a quick review and upgrade to five stars. The main reason is when I visit other oyster bars in the area, I feel they don't measure up to the 42nd street experience, and I often mention that in other reviews. In short these are the best oysters you will find in this area, period!Oh, and the five stars is strictly for sitting at the oyster bar. Make sure you do that at least once. I have ordered their steamed oysters, oysters on the half shell and baked oysters such as oysters rockefeller...all of my oyster experiences here have been excellent."
2015-02-28,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Casa Carbone Ristorante Italiano,"I grew up near a ""little Italy"" outside Philly and this place brought back memories of ""Martini's"" in Devon where we ate regularly. Casa Carbone is a simple, multigenerational Italian restaurant with classic dishes with great red sauces, smiling service and good prices for families on a budget. Son had great cheese pizza, wife had wonderful baked ziti and I had beef braciole. Great hot bread with  olive oil & herbs along with house salads accompanied. Our waiter was out of the Godfather and was perfect. Atmosphere a bit dated, but definitely recommended for hearty comfort food with fresh ingredients and excellent red sauces. We will definitely be regulars now."
2015-02-28,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Piola,This place is fantastic.  I had the BRACCIO DI FERRORicotta cheese and spinach -pizza. It was excellent! My husband had the Diavola-spicy pepperoni and it was also excellent. We had a Caipirinha cocktail that was spot-on. The service was good. My new favorite pizza restaurant in Raleigh.
2015-02-28,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Randy’s Pizza,"Perfect little place for a Saturday lunch. Clean, friendly staff, priced right, quick service & good pizza."
2015-02-28,5.0,"Burlington, NC",Oakwood Café,Good simple good. I like how cozy and intimate it is. I had the pulled pork and rise and beans and it was good. Plantains were really good. Would definitely go again.
2015-03-01,2.0,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",The Daily Planet Cafe,"I didn't have the food here, but I did have a latte (a few lattes, to be exact). A-maz-ing.First, I didn't realize The DP was based in a museum, but it is. It's right across from that big giant globe in downtown Raleigh. Disclaimer, I'm a Jersey transplant, so excuse me if I don't know all the right names for Raleigh sites!I will say that my chai tea latte was really fantastic. It was with 2% milk and sugar free vanilla syrup. It was amazing. I've had really good chai lattes before, I've had really bad chai lattes before. I would say that the chai latte at the DP actually beats the chai latte's I've had at Starbucks. That, to me, was kind of weird!The food is also really reasonably priced. $7 for angus burger. $7 for 5 blueberry pancakes and 2 eggs. That's super reasonable.It's VERY clean in the DP. I actually sat in the cafe for 3.5 hours doing work, courtesy of the Museum's free WiFi. It's super high speed wifi too, even during peak hours, so that was also a pleasant surprise.Also, in my opinion, the cashiers were VERY friendly! I think I found a new lunch favorite :)"
2015-03-01,4.0,"New York, NY",Oakwood Café,"The food here is delicious!  I wanted to try Argentinian food and was pleasantly surprised by this gem.  We got the fried cheese, yucca, empanadas, sausage and tres leches cake.  Everything was delicious and cooked to perfection.  The atmosphere is intimate and cute too."
2015-03-01,4.0,"Durham, NC",Cameron Bar and Grill,"These guys went above and beyond in service. My wife called ahead to let them know I had very strict diet needs. When we arrived, the manager and chef met with me to discuss options they could prepare for me. They prepared a delicious chicken salad for me that met my dietary restrictions and I was stunned at the very reasonably priced, special meal for me. I can't wait to return and eat something from their menu."
2015-03-02,3.0,"Cincinnati, OH",The Point at Glenwood,First visit to the point.  Service was fast but only somewhat knowledgable.  The food (i ordered a salad) was terrific.   Go.  It's worth it.
2015-03-02,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Jimmy V’s Osteria & Bar,"I enjoy coming to Jimmy V's a lot! It has a great atmosphere and friendly waitstaff.I recently came and started with the calamari - delicious!I also order the Roasted Chicken Saltimbocca - it was amazing! Tender, juicy, flavorful! It was the perfect dish! I used to order the Short rib pizza before they took it off the menu, until the other day I was having a hard time finding something else I liked as much as the Short Rib Pizza, but glad I have finally found something!"
2015-03-02,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Casa Carbone Ristorante Italiano,This recent visit saw me bring a guest who had never been here before.The service and the food were an exact replica of my first visit here.  My guest was extremely impressed and expressed a desire to return soonish!  She was surprised when I mentioned how long Lora had been working here and got a chance to talk to Lora herself as to why the longevity and received some background information on the history of Casa Carbone.On the way out a server I had not seen previously stopped me.  He told me that he had just served a table of patrons who specifically mentioned my review as the motivation for checking out Casa Carbone.   Now that's an awesome Yelp interaction!  I wish I had a chance to find out who they were but they apparently had already left while my guest and I chatted post-meal.I love this place.
2015-03-03,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Cariokos Rotisserie Chicken,Fresh and tasty! Now they have added fried chicken to their menu. I love the friendly staff. The restaurant is very small seat about 20.
2015-03-03,5.0,"Broadway, NC",Aggie’s Grill Station,"The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because I've only been here once. I reserve the right to upgrade my rating!  I had the beef wrap for lunch at the recommendation of the chef or manager (don't know). He told me how fresh all the ingredients were and described the dish to me to a T. It was outstanding, and I will happily go back for more.  Some people complain that they have an identity crisis. Well, I can see why they say that, but there is a huge variety of cuisines on the menu, so there is something for everyone. It's not a fast food joint, so don't expect your meal to come flying out. That doesn't mean they are particularly slow either. I was in and out in maybe 40 minutes or less."
2015-03-03,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Despina’s Cafe,"4.5This is a little gem of a place. I stopped by after several days of being sick because I knew I had to eat, but I wanted something kind of light. I got the Caprese Panini, and it was very tasty, I fully enjoyed that. I also got a vanilla latte, which was very good.I brought home some chicken salad for the next days lunch, and that chicken salad is something special. I absolutely love it. I also brought home some pastries, a bogatse and baklava. OMG!!! That bogatse is heavenly. Not too sweet, just perfect! It's like a little phyllo burrito with lightly sweetened ricotta rolled inside and dusted with some powdered sugar. The baklava is also among the best I've had.I've been meaning to try this place for a long times, but my work hours and their business hours don't seem to allow me much of an opportunity to stop in. But I will certainly be back when time allows."
2015-03-03,4.0,"Cincinnati, OH",Pam’s Farm House,"We were passing thru town, found Pam's on yelp, and decided to give it a try.   I wish we had a place like this were I live.  LOVED the atmosphere.    Servers and staff treat you better than Disney trained employees.   Friendly, helpful and always calling us ""Darlin'""   Oh...the food...wonderfully southern.  Perfectly prepared and delivered with a smile!   I highly recommend Pam's."
2015-03-04,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mami Nora’s,"I'm not sure how this review has fallen by the wayside, but it has. I spent a few weeks in Peru last year and I did so, in part, because of how damn good this place is. I don't need to tell you that it's the best chicken in the Triangle because you already know that. I also don't need to tell you that it's opened a second location on Capital because it's the best chicken in the Triangle. All you need to know is get here (not during the lunch rush), order anything on the menu (sans Inca Cola) and you'll love it."
2015-03-04,5.0,"Cary, NC",Randy’s Pizza,"One of my favorite Italian places to eat at. My co-workers and I go at lunch once a week. They have a great incentive for buying combo's in that you get a punch on your card every time you buy a combo, and after 10 punches you get a free extra large pizza. Their spaghetti plates are amazing, their subs are fantastic, and the service is fast. Nick is one of my favorite people that works during the lunch crowd. The pizza slices are huge and made fresh."
2015-03-05,5.0,"Denver, CO",Cafe Tiramisu,"Cafe Tiramisu is pretty average when compared to restaurants in the DC area, so perhaps I'm being a tough judge by not giving it a 4. My main qualm was that the veal tasted more like pork. Even my uncle had the same comment. The veal was tough and chewy, not tender and thin like it usually is at other places. I was impressed that they make their own spinach pasta in house; however, they overcooked it. If it had been al dente, I might have given 4 stars. The food just seemed more Americanized than what I'm used to when it comes to Italian cuisine. However, about half of my family enjoyed the meal and the other half said it was just eh, so overall no one hated it. My Italian grandfather was in the group of people who enjoyed the meal. But he likes to eat mushy food covered in sauce."
2015-03-05,4.0,"Marietta, GA",Moonlight Pizza Company,"My wife and I went last summer using a Groupon for a meal. Seating was limited due to a large party they were saving most of the tables for (which never arrived while we were there), so we ended up sharing a table with some random patrons with a dog. Serving staff was friendly, and nothing to complain about.We ordered a specialty mushroom pizza, and we were not disappointed. We enjoyed the pizza very much, and if it wasn't so far away from us, we'd definitely have come back. I think we'll go again this upcoming summer, and maybe explore more of Raleigh as well."
2015-03-05,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Casa Carbone Ristorante Italiano,"Been a couple of times and food has been really good, carbonara was awesome last visit! My wife and daughter also loved it. It does get crazy busy so best to arrive early. Will be going back again soon!"
2015-03-05,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Oakwood Café,"After hearing a lot of hype about this place from friends in the neighborhood, we were finally able to try it, and it did not disappoint. Their lunch menu offered many great choices, and we settled with both Cuban and Argentinian faire. The best thing I can say is they take the ingredients and let them speak for themselves, rather than try to overcomplicate them, and the results are great. I barely took a breath while devouring the pulled pork, fried yuca, and sweet plantains. Now just looking forward to trying their dinner selection."
2015-03-06,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Oakwood Café,"Sad to say but if you know good Cuban food, you will not like it here. I went for dinner and the meat was dry and flavorless, kidney beans tasted like the tomatoes they were cooked in, yucca was not fresh, and the portions were sooooo small.

2015-03-07,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Char-Grill,"Sometimes, you find yourself in a food mecca and starved at a weird hour. These times are fortuitous. Other times, you find yourself in Raleigh. After deciding that I've had enough MSG for a lifetime at Shanghai Express, I decided to look elsewhere to answer the call of the beast. Yelp suggested Char-Grill, so Char-Grill it was.Similar to places like Which Wich, place your order by checking the items that you want on slips of paper that feature all of their menu selections. I ordered a half pound hamburger steak with all the toppings, fries, and a drink. I was satisfied with what I thought would be a moderate price until I noticed the fact that every single topping is an upcharge. I'm not surprised that things like cheese and bacon cost extra, but lettuce also? Are you kidding me? They feature these ghost upcharges on the opposite side of the menu where you're almost certain to not look. This is frankly only a step above not advertising these upcharges at all. They should also list these upcharges on the order slips, but that would be too honest of a practice.Fortunately, the burger was very good. Even with the limited and decidedly non-premium nature of the toppings, I enjoyed the taste of my burger. The fries didn't quite measure up to the burger. While the portion is very good, the taste was not. I must be psychic because I requested salt and pepper before tasting a fry. Sadly, the cashier disregarded my request. I thought something that simple would be easily obliged, so I didn't double check that she put it in the bag. Sucks to suck.3.25 stars - had the cashier not ignored my request, I would've likely given this place 4 stars. I am not happy about their somewhat deceptive menu, but I've experienced worse. Char-Grill features a great burger, sub par fries, and average service. It is a great choice for late night, and a passable choice otherwise."

2015-03-07,1.0,"Cary, NC",Anvil’s Cheesesteaks,"When I first noticed this restaurant when we drove by and mentioned it to my husband, his hunger for a cheesesteak was born (or maybe it was already there, and it was now awakened!). He kept mentioning trying this place, and then one day we didn't really want to go to a 'usual' spot for anything in particular so we thought we'd finally give them a shot! And, I was pleasantly surprised by this spot! Even my toddler approves - haha! We ordered a chicken hoagie for our toddler because it seemed the most like something she would enjoy, but she eyed my husband's cheesesteak the moment he started to eat. He was nice and shared, and she devoured all that she could! As parents, we were surprised that she took to it so much, and were happy to see her eat something! I had a meatball sub (I was surprised and pleased to see non-cheesesteak items on the menu!) because I had a disappointing meatball meal recently and the itch was never really scratched (and we figured the toddler may eat this if she turned her nose to her sandwich). We ordered it with less sauce and I wish we hadn't because it really could have used more sauce - now we know! The meatball portion was generous, but a bit more cheese would have been nice too.Overall, my husband thought it was a little under-seasoned, but I thought it was fine (I prefer less salt). Honestly, I'm game to try more of the menu and look forward to my husband's next cheesesteak craving!!And that craving DID happen before I posted my review written to this point. I decided to have a cheesesteak on our most recent stop here. I do agree that the meat did not seem to be seasoned at all. I'm not sure if this is standard procedure for cheesesteaks or not, but to us we think all food should be seasoned well. /shrug We also tried the potato salad this time. It is on the sweet side, but seemed to have a nice flavor and was seasoned well. I'd order it again!"
2015-03-07,2.0,"Durham, NC",Abyssinia Ethiopian Restaurant,"I love Ethiopian food. But this particular restaurant did not meet my expectations. We ordered the Doro Wat (chicken) and the goat curry. Firstly, the quantity is less for the price for each entree. The goat curry did not have much flavor. The Doro Wat was just OK. The ambiance is really shady (poor lighting, bad interior). I normally wont care for the ambiance if the food is great. I read a lot of positive reviews here and decided to try this place. Unfortunately, it did not work for me."
2015-03-07,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",ORO Restaurant & Lounge,"If Sweden had a K&W Cafeteria it would be ORO, Oro for gold and the Mac & Cheese is golden! It was one of the best I've ever had. The portion was tiny (Unlike the one at Taste and Humble Pie) but it was great. The Spring Rolls were good, as was the Flat Bread with cheese and so forth. Yes, we know the portions here were Tapa size as the waitress explained but Tapas in Spain are usually quite filling at ORO they were not. Well, they are if you order 3 or 4  and share. Thank god I wasn't hungry otherwise I would've swiped someone's meat ball. The place got crowded fast and the clientele does not look the same as they did when ORO first opened, it was like an airport. I like that you can order 2 oz of wine. The sweets were very good, Creme Bru-haha and a bananarama pudding very tasty. ORO isn't one of those places I'm dying to return to, it was good but with so many choices you can experience this place once and that is enough."

2015-03-08,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Casa Carbone Ristorante Italiano,"I don't usually take the time to write reviews, but this experience was so bad, I couldn't help myself.  I've been here before and repeated the visit only because my boyfriend likes it.  He doesn't know any better having never been to Italy where there is no such thing as bad food.  This time I ordered the linguine and clams and was so disappointed to see my noodles swimming in a pool of oil; to the extent that I could not eat without it splattering all over my clothes.  The dish reaked of garlic (don't get me wrong, I love garlic) so I decided to pretend I wasn't hungry for the rest and took it home.  My teenage son will eat just about anything.  My waiter although very courteous and attentive came across as so fake and practiced that it just felt ingenuine.  Lastly, I have to mention that the restaurant decor is so dated, I don't understand how do they dare charge the steep prices AND get away with it. I don't mean to throw cheap shots, I can tell the staff is working hard, this review is meant for insightful and hopefully constructive criticism.  It's  time the owners recognize that no matter how well you are doing, there's always room for improvement.  Switch out those tacky flower table cloths and replace with white. Spray paint the cheap looking oak picture frames.  I could go on and on.  I think you get the point."

It's located right off of Glenwood ave in a small strip.  The owners are very accommodating and ensure their food is top notch. I've been here numerous times and can't resist ordering the Irish dip every time.  I'm sure the rest of their menu is delicious, but I'm a creature of habit!  I recommend Omailys to anyone wanting a nice place to grab a cold drink and some good food."
2015-03-10,5.0,"Hillsborough, NC",Los Cuates,"My 4 stars for Los Cuates is based primarily on their Carne Asada Fries, which should illustrate how good these fries are.I first tried the concept of Carne Asada Fries at Alberto's in Southern California and was taken away by such a simple, munchies food. Ever since, I've had perpetual cravings for this late night snack but have been unable to satisfy this need.Enter: Los Cuates. This place is hidden in the North Market shopping area, and provides a simple, clean environment with super legit Mexican/Latin American dishes. Although I only had the Carne Asada Fries, I could immediately tell from the menu that this place was the real deal.The fries were incredible, as I made sure to do it SoCal style by adding guacamole, sour cream, and hot sauce. You NEED to try them. For good measure I also had their horchata and caramel filled churros! The horchata was fairly good and the churros were cooked fresh and were delicious. I'm very pleased with Los Cuates and am looking forward to eating here again to try their other dishes, with the hopes of adding one more star to my review."

My number one lunch place, every week.  Menu has numerous choices from sandwiches (hot and cold) subs, pizzas, salads, soups and stews.  The have a refridgerated cabinet up front with goodies like Butternut Lasagna, salads & dinner entrees. Their daily specials are really hard to resist - very unusual combinations of flavors, meats and veggies.   Soups are fabulous!  Very very generous on portions.  My lunch usually lasts 2 days.Well worth the cost.  Try it  - you won't be sorry.  She knows what she is doing."

It was an amazing experience! Our server, Austin, was very knowledgable about the food and the beer selection and he was also very attentive. I had the jambalaya and it was the best jambalaya I have had in a restaurant. My daughter had the chicken fingers and waffle fries. The fries were extremely crisp and delicious! We will definitely come back again when we are in this part of town."

2015-03-11,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mami Nora’s,"Ok. I've tried this place twice now so I feel like my review is pretty accurate. This spot does chicken well. It's the closet thing I can find to my beloved pollo tropical in Miami. The chicken here is very moist and flavored well. There's a smokiness that is unmatched in ur average rotisserie chicken. Every bite is an explosion of flavor. The rice and beans have great flavor and are not over cooked. You will get one tiny sauce per order. Additional sauces are 25 cents. The green is jalapeño based and the yellow is a mayo/mustard combo. Both compliment your meal exceptionally well. If you do not purchase an inca cola you are missing out. It is literally liquid bubblegum. Just off the free way, mami noras is in a convenient location and worth the trip !"

Came for the coffee....Stayed to enjoy a Greek Frappé (chilled coffee), Italian soup and the best ever panini (caprese w/ balsamic chicken & basil)!! The beautiful cakes and variety of baked goods are lovely..! All made each morning by a smiling little old Greek lady - Despina!

2015-03-11,3.0,"Morrisville, NC",ORO Restaurant & Lounge,"We headed to this place on a Sunday evening, after hearing some great things from friends. To begin with, the ambience was really cool. It reminded me of restaurants in New York and I was getting excited about this dinner. Though I didn't get to try them, their cocktails selection seemed good. We ordered four entrees....rock shrimp tempura, seared scallops, jerk chicken flatbread and fish tacos. I tasted the scallops & it was amazing. I loved the sides they gave with it & drizzle of olive oil was so good. From there onwards, everything else went down hill. The flatbread was okay and I felt it was overcooked. I was hoping to have coconut shrimp kind of thing, but I didn't get a hint of coconut taste. It seemed like the chef didn't know how to do tempura. It was clearly spoilt. Fish tacos...again bad tempura & poorly done compliments.At the end of the meal, we were hungry & were too scared to try desserts & spoil our appetite further. Their service should either be more consistent or need to be improved soon."

Seeing all the good reviews on Yelp, we decided to give Kadhai a try and we were not disappointed. For two, we had vegetable samosas, naan, butter chicken, baingan bharta, rice and mango lassi. We ate till we were stuffed, but we didn't even make a dent in the dishes. We had enough left over to make two takeout boxes -- each with rice, chicken and eggplant. I know what's for lunch tomorrow! Service was pleasant and attentive enough but not intrusive. My water was regularly refilled. We came for dinner around 7:30 on a Saturday,  and the dining room was pretty quiet with only two tables seated. You can hear each table's conversation but that didn't seem to make anyone feel self conscious at all. The prices may seem high but we're essentially getting two meals. So yeah. Writing this review is making me hungry again."
2015-03-15,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Red Pepper Asian,"Sunday night and Husband actually uttered the words that he was hankering for Asian (not a common occurrence)...so I went with it, fast!  Searched ""best Asian"" here and was drawn right into reviews and pics from this place.  Off we went, unsure of where exactly.  Let me clarify:It's at the corner of New Hope and New Bern Avenue.  From the Beltline (New Bern Ave exit), it's less than a mile heading away from town, on the left in a strip center that has Carly C's and Hamrick's.  It is indeed small and when we arrived around 5:30 we got one of the last two open two-tops.  And there were people waiting for take-outs.  The whole time we were there, people were coming in for take-outs.  (understandably so!)No alcohol options.  Get over it.  I had to.  Unsweetened tea for me.  Diet Pepsi for Husband. Menu is full of pics that are quite helpful and drool-worthy. So is their website! TIP: the ""traditional"" menu that others have spoken about was not on the back of both our menus.  It does exist...Husband had it, and I was thrilled to find what I had seen Ron W post a pic of:  Malay Sambal Shrimp.  Husband opted for Hunan Beef.   We both wanted to try the Spring Rolls...one for me, two for Husband. Spring Rolls were served after several minutes, piping hot, with clean squeeze bottles of spicy mustard and sweet sauce.  Menu mentioned ground beef in them, but there wasn't any spotted. Didn't matter as the veggies were good and the wrapper was crisp.Entrees  arrived shortly after we finished the rolls and were as yummy-looking as they tasted. (see pics)  Both were served with bowls of rice.  Shrimp dish had red bell peppers, onions, lots of string beans and good-size plentiful perfectly cooked shrimp.  Very slight spicy kick. Husband was quite happy with his beef dish that was full of mushrooms, which he loved.  Also had broccoli and carrots. I traded a shrimp for a floret and it was a fair trade. Prices...very reasonable for the quality, quantity and expertise!  My shrimp dish was $12.95.  Husband's beef dish just $9.95.  Spring rolls $1.25 each and drinks $1.75 each.  A little over $30 before tip.  So worth every penny!Service just right, and even the fortune cookies were crisp and tasty.I will add that everything else we saw come out of the kitchen looked incredible, and everyone dining seemed quite happy.  And yes, you have to ask for chopsticks if you want them.  Loved that they don't waste them needlessly."

We shared the pick 2 wood-fired scallops and oysters and they were good, we just weren't overwhelmed overall. Lettuce wedge was just okay as well.

2015-03-19,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bida Manda,"Love it! Keeping with the other reviews here - Bida is great! As the reviews show, everyone else agrees with me so you definitely need a reservation several days out. I booked a Friday night reservation over a week in advance and they only had 9pm available!My wife and I came here for the first time on her birthday. This was also the night of the St. Patrick's Day parade ON THE SAME STREET! For that reason, parking and wading through all the drunks took awhile but once inside, it was peaceful and nice. As I said above, our reservation was for 9pm and I called every day to see if someone canceled an earlier reservation. Finally, the day of, we got a 730pm spot!Wait staff was attentive and super friendly. We took our time ordering and really enjoyed it.Drinks - best way to kick off dinner! I had the Marlon - it's pretty manly! They make strong drinks here so if you're ready for some hair on your chest, this is it. I'm a beer lover so I also had the Brewer's Old Fashioned and it was ok. Also will put hair on your chest!Appetizer - Had the crispy rice lettuce wrap at the recommendation of the waiter and it was glorious! Absolutely recommend!Entree - Settled on the Basil Stir Fry. It was good but by the end I was sweating. I'm ok with a little heat but this escalated quickly. Wife had the beef larb which was really good. If I came back I'd get that or the Pad Thai.Overall, definitely would come back again, just try something different. It earned 5 stars because the environment and staff more than made up for the couple of things I'd change about my order."

This place is no fancy dine in- it's a quick fast food spot.So yeah, I was not happy eating wings that took forever and tasted like ones I could buy pre-cooked at a grocery store and warm up myself.Oh and the garlic knots were lukewarm on the outside and cold on the inside. Bonus, they were rocks.....At least their fries and pizza are consistently good.Also, whenever we asked the workers about the rest of our menu, they replied as if we were in the wrong.Overall, I have learned the hard way that they can't handle crowds. They can try but it'll result in grumpy workers and unbelievably long waits."

My sister and I decided to try it for lunch today. Wow! I think that's the best Reuben I've ever put in my mouth!  The homemade chips weren't bad either!O'Malley's doesn't necessarily have curb appeal ( it's in a strip with several nondescript places ) but it's got lots of charm and my first experience was great. Will definitely go back!"

2015-03-23,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Taza Grill,"I've been going to Taza for a VERY long time. It is one of my family's favorite places to get a quick bite and we know that we're going to get great food and excellent service every time. First of all, the people who work at Taza are THE BEST. They always greet the customers as ""Boss"" and they remember our orders no matter how long it has been since we were last there. The food is always made to order and comes out quickly. When I was younger and before I broadened my food horizons, I ordered the steak and cheese combo which was good, but now I order the Gyro combo which is even better. They don't ever skimp on the meat or the toppings and there is lots of flavor. The combos come with fries that are cooked to order with the rest of your food so they are piping hot. The fries aren't anything special, but you should definitely add their fries seasoning that they have out by the register for a flavor boost. We often come to Taza just to get delicious pita bread to go, which we use to make so many other dishes at home. These pitas are way better than you would find in your typical grocery store and can really transform a meal.As for the price, I think it is a good deal for the amount of food you get with the gyros and sandwiches.  It is not any more expensive than your typical sandwich lunch spot (it might be even a little cheaper) and I always leave full and happy. The location may not look like much in terms of décor or seating, but the service and food make up for it."

2015-03-24,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Borough,"After reading Michaella K's review, I felt the need to interject. I do not have friends there, and I have to say this is one of the best places downtown, and definitely one of the best places for late night quality food. The staff is very attentive, friendly, and the food is on point all 4 times I've been there. Maybe that lady needs to stick to Applebee's or whatever the hell she's into, because her review of this place made her sound like a dumbass. Keep up the great work."
2015-03-24,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Moonlight Pizza Company,"Pretty good place - came on a date with a Groupon and got calzones (which were more than enough).

Hope to be back to try more, Groupon or not!"
2015-03-24,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Flying Biscuit Café,"Needed to grab a quick weekday brunch. My waitress (Tracie) was the best - super sharp, fun, and snappy, originally from NY (like me!).  I usually get the Southern Breakfast Bowl here but when she mentioned the pork belly sandwich with an egg over easy... no-brainer.  This was the best possible decision; that sandwich could not have been a fresher, tastier, more satisfying experience (although I did throw in a bit of Cholula to mix it up a bit).  I ordered grits but I couldn't eat them - I was too full.That said, I could get full just off of the buttery, flaky biscuits that they bring out to you first, with a side of delicious apple butter.OH and they have fresh squeezed orange juice, which is essential to any satisfying breakfast or brunch experience."
2015-03-25,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Brookside Market & Deli,"This place is great for takeout and very reasonably priced. So far I've tried a couple of their sandwiches and desserts. Everything has been GREAT. The chicken panini is amazing and huge and I will be ordering it regularly. Have yet to try the pizza but it's next!The market with groceries is pretty overpriced, but since it's less than a half mile from my house, it's very convenient when I don't want to make a trip to the store. They also have a good selection of beer!"

We went there for dinner tonight. We had a server, Emilie, who was so personable, knowledgable about the menu and went out of her way to give us exceptional customer service. We had the crab cakes, spaghetti and meatballs and fish tacos. Everything was delicious and there was a great selection of wine. the lighting in the restaurant and the decor gives the restaurant a great comfortable feel for date night or just for catching some dinner with friends. We will be back!"

2015-03-26,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar,"Almost 2 years.  That's how long it has taken me to get Husband back here for our second visit.  Not that our first was bad.  Just that I liked it more, and any time we attempted to go back, it was way too long of a wait to get in.Secret to get in: get there before everyone else does...so go early!   (as we did on this Thursday around 5:30)  They have indoor and outdoor seating.  We were given al fresco (which is covered) and a charming efficient Server.  I enjoyed a smokey Malbec, while Husband did a Bad Penny draft.  Previously Husband had liked a Bleu Cheese Burger okay, so this time he tried the Boursin Bacon one with shoestring fries.  Having done a Bento Box the first time (and very much liked it), I wanted to try something I would never attempt to make myself:  The Taste Explosion Roll.  If you get this very cool sushi/burger fusion, do not ignore the fresh ginger!  I soon learned that the spicy fresh flavor of that ginger made this roll indeed explode!  Until then it was quite good, but needed something to take it over the top.  The ginger did that.  Meanwhile, Husband was again just okay with his burger.  Felt the boursin got to be too much after awhile. Said he ""just hadn't found the right burger there yet""...sigh...hope it doesn't take me another 2 years to get Husband back!"
2015-03-27,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Piola,Visited this place through a happy hour/networking event. The pizza is delicious but the ravioli is extremely tasty. The wine selection is great and they have my favorite wine (malbecs). Great place to dine!
2015-03-27,5.0,"Brooklyn, NY",Bida Manda,"BEST Raleigh restaurantWhite people spicy? NO!Lao food like Thai foodVery fantastic food and amazing bar service. The bartender who doubled as our waitress was one of the best waitresses I've come across at a place that is by no means Michelin rated. (Although it totally should be just considering the food.)Get the coconut curry chicken wings, the pork belly noodles, and the sweet purple sticky rice with coconut milk. Wow everything was so flavorful and absolutely amazing. They were booked solid the entire weekend and we were only able to get in because we sat at the bar."
2015-03-28,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Despina’s Cafe,The almond cake is amazing taste all organic. The coffe is smooth and doesn't have that burnt taste like starbucks over all i enjoy it. Would probably go back to try out more of these wonderful cakes!

2015-03-29,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Point at Glenwood,"We passed by this place while traveling somewhere else but decided to stop for dinner. We had good appetizers, my husband had the pork barbq and coleslaw egg rolls and I had the blue shell crab dip with pita. Good flavors. The entree my husband had was beef tenderloins with a baked sweet potato. It needed a flavor boost but was tasty. I ordered the lasagna and it was awful. It was a huge bowl of greasy mess with very little sauce. I love Italian food but I could NOT eat this dish. When I called it to the waitress attention, I was told that thats the way lasagna is and they refused to take it off my bill. I took two bites. I told the waitress I was unhappy and the took off half the price of the greasy mess and an apology. I Will NEVER go there again. Too Expensive on top of everything else. Ugh!"
2015-03-29,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Abyssinia Ethiopian Restaurant,"I decided to check this restaurant out after getting personal recommendations from friends and aquaintances. My experience  definitely loved up to my expectations! I shared the meat combination and the vegetarian combination with my dining partner. The food came out on a giant plate, each dish in individual piles. We took bits of the thin pancake like bread to scoop up our food, as is traditional. Each dish was delicious! I am more of a vegetarian than not, so I especially love the red lentils, cabbage,  and collard greens. The sauces for our chicken, lamb, and beef were full of flavor and the meat cooked perfectly: not raw, not overdone. The staff were very gracious and attentive  and best yet- incredibly thankful for patronage. Conversely, we were thankful for such delicious dining experience!!"
2015-03-29,4.0,"Wilmington, NC",The Players Retreat,PR's is one of my favorite places in Raleigh. Their burgers are a must try. Great beer and outdoor seating are a good combination anywhere but add their food and you've got a winner for sure.
2015-03-29,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",NOFO At the Pig,"This is not the first time I've eaten here, but it had been quite a while. My wife and a friend of ours decided to try it again on a Friday evening. I arrived first, about 7:15P and after a few minutes was able to get a seat at the bar. Another gentleman took the other free seat next to me. After a few minutes the bartender asked the guy next to me if he wanted to see a dinner menu. He said yes, and I asked to see one as well. About 7:30 my friend arrived and as I waved him to the bar, the bartender brought one menu for the guy beside me, but not for me. My friend and I chatted for several minutes while at the bar. About 7:45 I caught the bartenders eye as he had not waited on us yet, although he had been out chatting to people in the dining area several times and was able to get drinks for all of his regulars at the bar. When I got the bartenders attention, he curtly said ""I SEE you. You've been talking"" and walked off to the floor again. About 8:00 the hostess came and told us our table was ready. We were both pretty unimpressed by now and were thinking of leaving. However the waitress was nice and got us drinks and and an appetizer. My wife arrived and we ordered dinner. The food was OK, but nothing spectacular. My wife had ordered the fried green tomato appetizer as a dinner and we were surprised that it contained only 3 pieces of tomato for $7.  I know that this place is well liked in the 5 Points area, but this bad experience will make me try other places downtown."
2015-03-29,5.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Pam’s Farm House,"This is a hole in the wall if there ever was one! It's in the middle of nowhere and could easily be overlooked as a rundown business. BUT STOP. Take a moment to drop by and get some good OL' southern lovin'!There's an open parking lot in the back that has plenty of space. You have to go through a couple of doors to get to Pam's but there are signs so don't worry!When you first walk in, it's a little awkward because it's probably not what you expected. It feels like an old school cafeteria - lowkey, a little dingy, dimly lit, rolls of paper towel at each table, cafeteria chairs, etc. Don't let it change your mind. Commit! Commit!!We were seated immediately and a sweet southern grandma waited on us. I LOVE IT. Elderly-friendly, in terms of waitstaff and patrons. We weren't entirely sure what to order or what the process is even like. (It can be confusing because there are a lot of different menu items with different combinations). Our waitress patiently explained our options and her/customer favorites. We ordered the BBQ chicken with hot sauce and sides of fresh cole slaw and rice and gravy. The hot sauce wasn't very hot (4/10 but I'm asian and eat spicy foods regularly so ...) and tasted a little sour but in a good way. The chicken was SUPER tender like slide-off-the-bone-and-melt-in-my-mouth tender. The cole slaw wasn't too heavy and tasted clean and fresh. The rice and gravy were like uncle ben's rice with some gravy in the center, but I think that's just southern rice and gravy for ya.We also got the hamburger steak with real creamed potatoes and sliced tomatoes. The hamburger steak was a little chewy, but the gravy was good and had a little smoky flavor. The tomatoes were warm (I'm not a fan of warm tomatoes) and the creamed potatoes tasted fresh from real potatoes and not too salty or buttery with small chunks of potatoes.Both dishes came with biscuits and hush puppies which were really good! The biscuits are amazing.As she served us our entrees, our waitress said: ""Hope ya enjoy, sug"" :'))) I'm from California and after three years in NC, I'd never heard anyone say that to me so it was heartwarming to say the least!Like other reviewers have noted: no frills here. Nothing but simple southern lovin'!"

2015-03-30,3.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Pam’s Farm House,"My family and I have been coming here since I was born; it hasn't always been Pam's but I don't really remember it being anything else. In my humble opinion the standout dish here is their hot cakes - thick, browned, flavorful, substantial (and their syrup's delicious too). I have not yet found a better version and I can no longer tolerate your standard stacks of pitiful flavorless pancakes because of this place. I always get a hot cake and a side of eggs, bacon, or sausage (and a glass of sweet tea, of course) and I'm always happy. I usually can't finish the whole cake. My dad often gets the same or French toast which he's always happy with. Lunch is good too - I have to admit I always get hot cakes, but my mom usually gets something off the daily specials menu which is usually freshly prepared southern comfort food. I always try some and it's always decent. I also love their hush puppies and grilled biscuits that come as a side with the specials. If I wasn't so obsessed with the hot cakes I would be all over the specials. Another thing my mom often gets is banana pudding (if they haven't run out) which is also consistently delicious. The other thing I love about this place is the atmosphere - southern charm. You will likely be called ""honey,"" ""sweety,"" or ""darlin."" I've never really prided myself on being Southern (even though I'm a native North Carolinian) but I love it here because it's not an in-your-face, gimmicky kind of Southern - instead it's very casual and authentic. This remains our go-to breakfast/lunch place because of its consistently good, fresh comfort food, all day breakfast, low cost, good service, and casual atmosphere."

2015-03-31,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Abyssinia Ethiopian Restaurant,"I felt like I had the true ethiopian dining experience. The food is served on massive plates with traditional injera bread serving as your spoon. I got the Doro wat chicken dish and it was delicious. It's kind of hard to describe the taste but there was plenty of flavor with all the different spices. It was not spicy. My only complaint is that it only came with one drumstick and the chicken was so good, I definitely wanted more. On another note, the collard greens side was the best I've ever had. I went with a large group and there were a variety of dishes, all of them looked tasty. One person ended up picking something that was too spicy for her. During the week it seems a little slow in terms of the amount of customers, so that might be nice if your looking to avoid a crowd. Prices are reasonable considering it's an exotic meal. Staff was friendly and attentive."

I have only tried the pizza, but I have been with friends who say their sandwiches are fantastic. The staff has aways been super helpful and top notch. I have also been in the restaurant when firemen, police or the military have entered and they have always given a little discount. Hats off to Randy for looking out for the guys that look out for us."
2015-04-02,5.0,"Cary, NC",Saint Jacques,"I knew by all of the Yelp and OpenTable reviews that this place would be great. I took my boyfriend here for dinner to celebrate his birthday, and from the moment we stepped inside, we were not disappointed. First, I have to say I was nervous driving up because the restaurant is located in a strip mall, and you would never know the hidden gem inside if it weren't for sites like Yelp. As soon as we entered the restaurant we were pleasantly greeted and someone took our coats. We were escorted to our table which was tucked away in the second room of the restaurant along the far wall. I always commend restaurants for seating diners away from other guests, and this is exactly what they did. For most of our evening we had the whole corner entirely to ourselves which made our dinner that more special.They called to confirm my OpenTable reservation a couple days in advance. At that time they asked whether we were celebrating any special occasion, and when we sat down for dinner our waiter told my boyfriend happy birthday!After promptly taking our drink order and providing me with a wine menu, someone came over to take our wine order. I had several questions, and the waiter did a fantastic job describing the types of wine and pointing me to something I would like. He continued to come by at the perfect moments to refill our glasses as needed throughout the evening. We had a separate waiter who tended to us for dinner (Jodie/Jolie I think?). She was fabulous. We started with the Fois Gras. My boyfriend has always wanted to try it, and I will say it was amazing. For dinner I ordered the Sole and my boyfriend got the Duck. I was tempted to get the Sea Bass, but being at an authentic French restaurant, I thought I should try something different. The sole was very good (shrimp and crab mousse roll), and it's exactly what I imagine it should taste like. I'm glad I had the chance to try it but next time I will get something different. The duck was delicious. We ended our evening with a glass of port and the chocolate mousse. The dessert was so delicate and melt in your mouth wonderful - which was exactly how we started our meal with the fois gras. All the way through to the end, we were impressed and can't wait to plan our next trip back.I think the things we appreciated most were attention to detail and how delicious the food was. We really enjoyed the surprises when our waiter came out with a surprise from the chef. One was before our appetizer and it was a little bite which had all the perfect tastes (I still can't remember what it was called...) but it woke our taste buds up and got us excited for our appetizer. The second was before our entree and was a lavender peach sorbet to cleanse the palette (exquisite!) If you're a guy dining here, you should know that they provide all of the women with a menu sans pricing. At first I thought they meant to give my boyfriend that menu since I told them it was his birthday in advance, but nope - ladies only! Also, you should know that they only serve beer and wine here.I think the restaurant would have an even more European feel if it were in Lafayette Village or somewhere similar. I would recommend a few updates to the decor to refresh the dining rooms a bit, but regardless, we will keep coming. It's not about the pictures or curtains anyway but rather the exceptional food, attention to detail, and wonderful service that we received dining here."

2015-04-04,1.0,"Durham, NC",Casa Carbone Ristorante Italiano,"I had heard many great things about this place akin to it was seriously legit Italian.  Went here with my family for a special occasion and pretty much instantly fell in love.  I love the ambiance,  the reviews are right,  this is a throwback Italian restaurant and extremely cozy.  I had high hopes and they were definitely exceeded.  The service was friendly and top notch just like the food.  We started off with salads and calamari,  I just had the calamari but did try some of their house balsamic dressing,  yeah it rocked.  The calamari was perfect not chewy at all and the marinara was great.  We got a carbonara as a appetizer too for us all to try and it was pretty good.  If you like Fettuccine Alfredo or Carbonara you will love it.  For entree I had to get the Shrimp and Lump Crab in Lobster Sauce.  Apparently it's a Sunday special and it wasn't on the menu, but they still made it anyway even though it was a Saturday.  So delicious,  I've never had a cream sauce like this one, it was very rich and this dish had big shrimp and a ton of crabmeat (like I can't believe they put this much in here).  I tried someone's chicken parm and it was absolutely one of the best I have ever had.  The prices were extremely reasonable  (I'd say really cheap for what you get) the portions were huge, nobody finished their entrees.  I took a lasagna to go cause I had to try that!  I actually tried a bit when I got home cause it looked so good.  Excellent,  perfect lasagna,  the sauce was delicious and there was pretty much more meat then ricotta.  This place truly deserves a 4.5, way better than any chain Italian place I've ever been,  so definitely stop by sometime."
2015-04-04,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Alpaca Peruvian Charcoal Chicken,"Hands down most delicious char grilled chicken around.

Take out is available and widely used.  The customers come from every walk of life but all have in common a  love of good food!  This new location is not yet as crowded as the older ones, but it will be when word gets around.  Oh yes.. try the sauces.  I like to blend a little of the green hot into the sweeter yellow."

It takes me a while to finally find it. Food: When I first stepped into the place, there were only 2 huge tables with 8 chairs. And I went straight to order some bakery. Bostoki, bread budding and that's it.I dislike bread budding. It doesnot have much texture and it tastes like breadish jam with some sugar in it. Not what I want. Bostoki is good tho. Although I wish almond could be more crispy. Service: serve yourself babe. Overall: I am not a fan. I noticed that BREW Coffee is really close and seem like be more people there. Yeah, the problem with this store is that a good bakery needs good barista as well. But here, I cannot see any sign of barista and not a lot of coffee choices. In addition, the place is not well used at all. Seats are limited but there are plenty space to use. And bakery is not outstanding compared to Boulted Bread, the downtown expensive one and even yellow dog. I am disappointed."
2015-04-07,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Square Rabbit,"This place is the bomb! I work downtown so I frequent this place often. They have so much to choose from and a variety of entrees that change each day. The prices are great and I never spend more than $5-$6 for a decent portion, sometimes saving half for dinner or lunch the next day. I highly recommend the square rabbit!"
2015-04-07,5.0,"New York, NY",Despina’s Cafe,"I have been longing to come here for a pastry festival for a long time. And here I am.Location: the location is North Raleigh, where I hardly ever will come. The store is besides a FedEx store. It is not hard to find but not easy either.Atmosphere: Lovely place with lots of seats and soft for you to seat on. A huge front counter desk for bakery selections.Pastries: I had Bogatse; Spanakopita; almond cake. Bogatse is amazing. I am not a cheese person but the crispy shell absolutely covers the smell of cheese but better serves as a carrier for taste. Spanakopita is made of spinach. It's like a spinach tart. I love anything with spinach, but this one is so far the best I have ever had. Still, a cripy top later with a dense spinach tart bottom. The spinach is mixed well with the shell, and I just cannot get enough of it. ATTENTION: ALMOND CAKE IS DA KING! I have not had such a good delicious and well-balanced cake for 4 years. I hate dense layer American cakes and I prefer soft layer cakes. And this is exactly I wish I could have for a long time. I can taste the shredded almonds moistured with the cake. The cream is not dense and overly used. In the middle, a soft pudding kind cream transfer the cake back to the taste of almond. HEAVEN! Service: Really nice. They asked me if I wanna warm up my Spanakopita and Bogatse and told me that it would take about 5 minutes. Thanks for the heads up! OH, PLEASE WARM UP Spanakopita and Bogatse . PLEASE! OTHERWISE, IT PROBABLY WOULD TASTE LIKE NOTHING.Price: almond cake is about 7; Spanakopita is about 5 and Bogatse is about 4.The portion is huge so I would say not bad!Overall: IT'S A FIVE STAR BAKERY. I wish the location is more accessible but I guess they do not have much choice. I think I will stop craving for donuts and switch to almond cake."
2015-04-08,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mo-Te Vietnamese Restaurant,"Came back here the next day. Craving bubble tea again! Seems a little hit and miss with the consistency. And by that I mean the thickness. I like my bubble tea smoothie style and they were very runny this time. Also the flavors we tried this time were not as good. We tried the Jackfruit and the White Chocolate. I would not order either of these flavors again. I will try this place one more time and hope to get the amazing experience I had the first time. If not, I will be looking for a new bubble tea go-to.  Too high priced to not be more consistent of a product. About $5.00 each."
2015-04-08,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Guasaca,"After my first bite at Guasaca, my immediate thought was ""Where have arepas been all my life?!"" I never knew what I was missing! There is not another place like Guasaca in the Triangle. The ingredients are fresh and bursting with flavor!WARNING: Grab a fork and a handful of napkins, because it will get messy!I created my own arepa, consisting of shredded beef, slaw, plantains, and onions. PERFECTION. They also have their signature arepas that you can select if you don't want to create your own. Guasaca has several sauce options to add a variety of flavor to your arepa. My favorites are the ""green/cilantro"" and the mustard. If you are looking for more of a kick, then the red sauce is the way to go. They have not charged me extra when I have requested extra sauces, so try them all out to find your favorite. We also ordered the chips and Guasaca sauce. The chips have a hint of lime and are addictive. And the Guasaca sauce is awesome and similar to guacamole. It costs extra, but it is worth it.Another plus to grabbing a bite here are the prices. They are incredibly reasonable for such fresh ingredients and amazing flavor. One arepa and some chips to share is filling enough for me. But on a couple of very hungry occasions I have ordered 2 arepas, putting me in a food coma.Don't let long lines discourage you from getting a meal here, because the service is extremely fast. During peak hours it can be hard to find a table, but there is also a great courtyard in the back where you can enjoy your meal.Try it out and you won't regret it! But beware, you might become addicted!"

2015-04-09,5.0,"Washington, DC",Guasaca,"Love it! Had the shredded beef bowl/salad. You can add as many toppings as you want (chipotle style). I got the plantains, braised onions, tomatoes, and Guasaca sauce (this is extra but worth it!!!) Guasaca sauce is like guacamole- has avocado, tomatoes, etc. Tried the green cilantro sauce and red hot sauce on the side which were good too but didn't even need it because the bowl was so flavorful already! The meat was tender and flavorful, and so delicious w all of the toppings. Plantains so good! I loved this place because though everything was delicious and full of flavor I didn't feel heavy and super fat afterwards!! There's so many different options & arepas so there are options for everyone! It's chipotle x 1000000 better!!!! Ps. There's a groupon!"
2015-04-10,5.0,"Cary, NC",The Daily Planet Cafe,"I really want to love this place. I work down the street from DPC. It's fast, convenient, the price is ok for a Downtown restaurant. However, the food is so inconsistent. I first fell in love with Local Brie sandwich. It was so good. I've tried twice since then and they were not nearly as good as the first time. It got so greasy and stingy with bacon and chutney. The bread was not really grilled. They were bad.I've also tried vegetable quesadilla for four or five times. Some are better than others but these were more consistent than other menu. Someone reviewed the vegi burger here and I agree. it was really good. I've tried a Byson burger and it was good as well (but nothing special).My biggest disappointment and the reason that I decided to take time to write a review is their NEW grass fed Angus beef burger.  They were featuring burger that was made from local beef. I was suspicious when my burger came out because it was too fast. Normally I have to wait for 5-10 minutes when they are busy during the lunch time. However, it was ready in 2 minutes. The burger was so hard and overcooked. The bun was dry. It was worse than Wendy's burger. I was so disappointed.It seems like I get disappointed by the food 70 % of time, 20% of time I go meh, and I get really impressed 10 % of time.I might go back there again because it's so close to work. Otherwise, I will not bother take a chance to get disappointed again."

Useful practical advice on menu items, no pretension at all.The food was SPECTACULAR. It was well seasoned, well presented and well portioned. We had a 3 course meal. being picky...the pate could have had a little more kick to it and some music...or slightly louder music would help with early evening ambiance. I certainly don't want loud music but a little touch would be nice.Highly recommend...go here right now!GO!"

2015-04-11,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Thai House,"A colleague of mine told me at work yesterday that ""by the way, Thai House is the best Thai restaurant in the entire triangle."" Since my wife and I both love Thai, I read up on it and after seeing so many others give good reviews too, my wife and I had to check it out ASAP so went their last night around 8:30 pm. It was medium busy but we were waited on and seated quickly. The staff was superb, very young, polite, and pleasant. We loved our food and give it 5 stars. The decor was lovely too, very clean yet more Thai folksy then trying to have a highfalutin look. Summer rolls to die for, delicious yum nua, red curry chicken soup to die for, and Thai basil duck (our waitress' favorite and her recommendation that we took) that was off the charts. I have been staying away from fried Thai but my wife ordered (fried) spring rolls and they were both a) not greasy at all, and b) the best tasting I have had. They slice them at an angle and expose wonderful greens and are accompanied by a delicious sauce that is easy to spoon over them.We'll be going back soon and regularly."
2015-04-11,5.0,"Wake Forest, NC",Vinos Finos Tapas and Wine Bar,"What a great find in Lafayette Village!  Although the outdoor tables were all full (@7pm on a Friday night in April), we had no problem getting a table inside (Note:  the restaurant only accepts reservations for groups of six or more).  The decor at Vinos Finos is smart and upscale, and of course the setting at Lafayette Village is charming. We tried four of the ""small bites"" on the menu:  Goat cheese stuffed Pequillo peppers with basil olive oil; Herb-marinated grilled shrimp with Peruvian yellow pepper sauce; Seared tuna on tortilla chips with wasabi aoli; and Herbed foccacia crostini with roasted vegetables and melted cheese.  All were terrific; we especially liked the shrimp, but everything was really, really good.  The small plate offerings (there were about a dozen on the menu) range from $4 to $9.Wine flights are ~$14-$15 and each offers a 2oz. taste of 3 different themed wines.  The wine list itself isn't extensive, but there are some nice bottles and most glasses are $7 to $11.  We tried the Chilean Undurraga Pinot Noir; it was $7 per glass; bottle price was $26.  An interesting point is that Vinos Finos is also a wine retailer.  The Undurraga was priced at $15, if you wanted to purchase it.  For a comparison, I checked this bottle on Wine Searcher, and prices ranged from $16.22 to $19.47, so Vinos Finos' pricing was very reasonable!  Also of note is a Thursday night 1/2 price wine promotion (on bottles), which would definitely be worth taking advantage of.  If you don't finish your bottle, they'll re-cork it so you can bring it home.Finally, I should note that Vinos Finos also offers a half dozen or so regular entrees and a couple of specials.  Most entrees seemed to be priced $12 to $14; the specials were a bit more expensive.  Our dinner - 4 small plates, two glasses of wine - was $50 w/o tip.  I should note that one of the glasses I tried was $11 (Bread and Butter Chardonnay), which inflated the bill a bit.This would be a great place for date night, or fun casual dining with friends.  The food was uniformly excellent.  We'll definitely be back!!Edit - 4/13/15:  it appears Vinos Finos does accept reservations for smaller parties, as the Yelp reservation app appears on its Yelp page.  I based my comment above on what our waitress told us.  Sorry for any confusion."

2015-04-12,1.0,"Honolulu, HI",Babylon Restaurant,"I went here for brunch with on husband on Easter Sunday - this was not my first trip - I had come for brunch with some girlfriends in the fall and absolutely adored the outdoor seating and the unique menu and I was excited to share that with my husband.We had a reservation at 11 am and we showed up and found out that it was buffet that day. The buffet was ""not ready"" so we waited. And waited. Eventually the buffet was open and I was disappointed that there were only a few basic breakfast items that were overcooked, undercooked, cold or just ill prepared. After we got out first plates of food, our waitress finally showed up and asked if we needed anything to drink because she ""noticed"" we were sitting in her section. At this point, the restaurant was not very busy at all.Overall, the food was awful. Our service was even worse. I should never have to be asked what I would like to drink after I've waited 20 minutes and after I have gotten my food. One other waiter was working the outdoor section was helping everyone but our table, even after he noticed we were not being helped, and we ultimately had to ask him for the check.Sadly, I will not return to Babylon anymore. I haven't had to have such a terrible restaurant experience in a while and for what we paid, the food and the service were just too awful. There are a few days a year restaurants need to be on their A-game for brunch and this was one of them but Babylon completely failed."

Restaurant is upstairs, and if you get a table by the window, you get a nice view of the surrounding area. Food is absolutely excellent with plenty of healthy options. Great for vegetarians and meat eaters. Service is ok - they seemed to be a little short staffed for the amount of lunch business they had during our visit."

I asked the lady behind the counter if the cookies were soft because i do not like hard cookies. She said oh yes, they're soft. I bought a dozen based on her word. What a mistake!!! The cookies were hockey pucks to put it mildly. The owner should be ashamed of their self selling this crap. There was nothing you can do to eat them. Milk wouldnt even soften them. I had to trash the entire dozen. If i didnt live 2 hrs away i would take them back and throw them at the window. It would surely do some damage!! Dont waste your money here"

This place still offers the finest chinese takeout and family-sized portions.This restaurant is out of the way for me but I wanted to take a mini trip out here to see if their food is still as good as I remembered it to be.Yup their portions are still massive, prices are cheap, and food is absolutely delicious.Their Singapore noodles have so much flavor with pieces of pork/shrimp/chicken in it and it was cooked flawlessly!Their general tsos was yummy but some of the pieces of chicken were a bit dry. Also, I wish their general tso sauce had a bit more heat to it.Anyhow, their fried rice isn't anything special but it's just a side that comes with their entrees so can't complain! Their entrees ALSO come with a huge egg roll. Note, there is no ambiance here. The place has plenty of tables and seats but it's not a place to go for a fancy date or anything like that. It's definitely a casual take out place.You might not leave with the bikini body you've been wishing for but you'll definitely come out with a 100% satisfied tummy."

It's what I'm used to and I don't get why there aren't more places like this in Raleigh if they're tryin to be cool. Bottom line: Great food. Crazy big portions so if you're like me there'll be leftovers. Grocery prices are a tad high but ya gotta forgive that - it's a small place, and this isn't where you buy your staple groceries every trip.

2015-04-17,3.0,"Clayton, NC",ORO Restaurant & Lounge,"I read the reviews and still went in with an open mind. I'll break down the review further below. I don't like to give 1 star unless a place is really bad, so I have it a respectable 2. The short of it, I don't recommend this place and won't be going back.Restaurant/service: 2 stars. Observations about the restaurant itself...it seems that they are trying to portray an upscale chic dining experience. The restaurant itself was nice although very loud inside just since its open and 2 stories. Not a big deal for us, but some might find it problematic. The staff weren't presented very well. I don't expect fancy, but for example, the host was wearing cargo khakis and a baggy denim shirt. They just didn't seem very professional. Again I don't like pretentious, but I do like professional and sociable. Our particular waitress was not very engaged and just seemed to be in a rush. She stood at the end of the table and expected everyone to know she was there and give her undivided attention. We had a group of 8 and they will not split checks. This is completely ridiculous given they have a computer to order. Really?  It took us longer at the end of the meal to hassle with splitting the checks than it would have taken them. WAlso, they added a 20% gratuity. She deserved 15% max....Food: 3 stars. Most of what we got was average in taste. The short ribs were excellent, the truffle Mac and cheese was really good but the tempura was ok,and the fried artichoke hearts were bad. The brownie was really good but for $8 it should have been a lot larger...more on the value later. Others had very good dishes and all enjoyed their food. But it just wasn't very memorable. Value: 1 star. Small plates to ""share""...that's their motto. I guess each person could have a bite. But the prices of the dishes are what you pay for an entree elsewhere. As others noted, we spent exactly $70 ( no drinks...just food) and left hungry.Try some other Raleigh restaurants, unless you want to pay a lot to feel ripped off."
2015-04-17,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Alpaca Peruvian Charcoal Chicken,We love it here. The wake forest rd location is the best but the food is consistent. It's a great place to stop by and get dinner on the way home. The smokiness of the chicken takes the meal to a whole different level. The rice is always tender and the beans are yummy. The green and yellow sauces are great and they have inca kola ! Stop by here for a quick dinner !
2015-04-18,4.0,"Hillsborough, NC",Guasaca,"Countless times have I been to Guasaca, and countless times have I left satisfied. The only problem I have is that I am consistently torn between keeping their beloved arepas to myself and yelling their praises form the rooftops.Guasaca has become such a fan favorite because they appeal to everything a customer looks for: quality, speed, and value. Every trip to this Chiptole-esque restaurant has me complimenting their food and shaking my head in disbelief of their prices.I am fond of their avocado chicken, but you can't go wrong with any of their meats. Even the tilapia. I do suggest getting an arepa rather than a rice bowl on your first trip, just so you'll know what they're like (spoiler: they're like heaven)DO make an effort to try this place, and I'm willing to bet my cat that you'll leave satisfied."

Im in heaven. I ordered the Greenhouse effect and much like that phenomenon, it made me feeling hot...in the best way possible! In addition to the delectable toppings (olives, mozzarella, tomatoes, spinach, garlic, and don't forget the lemon zest), the dough and especially the braided crust were just a perfect combination of flavors in my mouth. Also, I love it when pizza places don't charge for ranch. And it was a generous amount! Also huge kudos to our server who wiped down our table before we ate outside. It just rained and no one else was eating outside but they went out of their way for my small town dreams of eating outside with the view of downtown raleigh. Also felt like I was receiving princess treatment from how attentive and nice the staff were. Thank you for a great experience under the moonlight!"

The flavor is sweeter and more tamarindy than what I'm used to. It didn't taste super greasy though which I liked.Food comes out super fast and the lady was really nice. Mom and pop family business. Their dinner menu is actually pretty pricey for thai food -- it's like NYC/SF prices."

2015-04-20,1.0,"Columbia, MD",Thai House,"Tortured at the Thai House....Sunday was a rainy day, and I found myself craving chicken Pad Thai. I visit Yelp for some info on my local options. I had heard Sawasdee was good, but Thai House was closer, and after all, it had 4 stars! What could go wrong? 92 reviews and 4 stars, it has to be good, right?Wrong. Very, very wrong.The exterior was charming enough, with unlit Christmas lights dangling loosely from the front edge of the roof. I entered to a tastefully appointed dining area, and was greeted by a young hostess/waitress, obviously Thai, with only a rudimentary grasp of the English language. This excited me, for it spoke of authenticity, and I eagerly awaited a delicious and spicy thai experience.As I was seated, however, a problem become very apparent: the music. It was so damned loud. Let me begin by stating that they have a very well-equipped sound system. It is unfortunate, then, that they had it turned up to 11, and blasting Eminem rap music followed by other modern pop music at full blast the entire time I was there.So nerve-jangling. I wondered if they could really be so tone-deaf as to subject the customers to this, and as I contemplated saying something, a brave table of four people, four heroes, really, requested that very thing. The waiter (a male Thai fellow, the only other waitstaff in the restaurant, which unfortunately meant that my waitress had to double up on hostess and takeout duties in addition to waiting my table. one can imagine the level of service I received.) obediently turned the damned music down.No sooner had he turned it down, then an elderly Thai lady whom I can only assume was either ownership or management emerges from a cleverly hidden door to an office right by the speaker and the front door. She looks around, cocks her head to the side, and then rushes to ramp up the volume of the music again. The following comical scene, faithful to the events that occurred:(Male Thai Waiter, rushing towards the front desk): ""No! No! The customer requested it. It's too loud for them!""(Elderly Thai manager, with a confused and angry look on her face) ""WHAT!?! But can no hear! Too low! They no like music?!""She was magnanimous enough to turn it down to half thje deafening level of before, while shaking her head in a puzzled and angry manner. I mean, how DARE the customers think they have a right to comfort, how DARE they think they're right. It's not as if THEY are the reason the business can exist in the first place. Obviously the lady never heard the phrase ""customer service"". What a joke.And as an aside, if you're going to be in the Thai restaurant business, please, PLEASE, just play the generic Thai karaoke muzak that no one understands but everyone can easily and pleasantly ignore. NO ONE wants to listen to Eminem, Maroon 5, Whitney Houston (I know I know, it was the unholy mixture of 90's soft pop and early to mid2000's radio hits) and other tripe at club-level volume.Enough about the music/service. What about the FOOD????NOW, onto the Food:First I noted just how freaking expensive their dinner items are. $12.99 for a plate of Chicken Pad Thai?!?!?!?!?!?!?!This must be amazing food, I thought to myself. Surely it must be mind-blowing at the cost for what amounts, really, to Thai street food.Well I must assure you, it was, by FAR, the worst Pad Thai I have ever had at a restaurant.Now, this is not to say that it was blatantly OFFENSIVE in taste and texture, but rather, that it had NO TASTE....none whatsoever. Instead of a spicy mélange of Eastern flavors and aromas, I was greeted with a steaming platter of sweet, mushy, sticky noodles, with some limp, flavorless chicken bits and bean sprouts laid on top, and a wedge of lime.The plate was an enormous amount for one person, but still, $12.99??And I must repeat, it had ZERO heat. None. It lacked any flavor. I have had frozen chicken pad-thai from the supermarket that blows this restaurant's excuse for pad thai out of the water. They could have at least offered some Sriracha or chili sauce, anything to provide some flavor to this dish.I took two bites, decided enough was enough with this restaurant, and waited for my server to appear so that I could request my check, pay it, and then go get some sushi.Oh yeah, that's right, she's also the hostess, and the take-out girl. Silly me. The restaurant had maybe 5 tables. I do not understand why she chose to bus mine. I was her ONLY table. The Male Thai Waiter could've easily added me to his roster, what with the restaurant being so sparsely packed. But no, they chose the most awkward arrangement whatsoever. She got a stream of take-out people coming in (which I just don't understand. What is wrong with you, my fellow peoples of Raleigh? Have you no taste buds? We can do better than this.) I was never asked how it tasted, offered more water, just barked at in clipped English by the hostess after I finally flagged her down for my check. Pure Torture."

They respect that service is a critical part of the dining experience, take it very seriously, and routinely go above and beyond to provide guests with the best experience possible. For example, the chef has made me special, nut-free desserts (completely on the fly) on two different occasions when the entire dessert menu featured nuts (even though I said I was fine and didn't request it) since the rest of my party was enjoying dessert and they didn't want me to feel left out. You can count on thoughtful, professionally executed service at Betski's. -Notes: They serve the best pierogies you'll ever have, and their often-unique combinations never disappoint. Oddly enough, though, as much as I love and respect Betski's, there's something about their menu copy that just doesn't entice me quite like other restaurants, and I've met several other people who feel the same or who have even noted that reading the online menu is what held them back from visiting even after people suggested that they go and told them how amazing it is. Everything that comes out of that kitchen is infinitely better than it sounds on the menu, though; so, if that's what's been holding you back, go. You won't regret it. -Cons: It's a bit pricey, but totally worth it.-Overall Rating: 10/10-Website: jbetskis.com"
2015-04-21,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Seaboard Cafe,This place is so cute and quaint. It's located in the trading store and the cafe is situated in the back near the nursery.I ordered the tuna with Swiss. It was a tasty sandwich that had cranberries on it and of course I had the fries too! The best thing about this place is the view of the nursery and being surrounded by all of the gorgeous flowers.
2015-04-21,5.0,"Atlanta, GA",Aggie’s Grill Station,Awesome service! Great half and half tea! I had the bourbon chicken and my friend had the Mango salmon. We both agreed the food was great and fresh! Definitely some of the best fried rice EVER. And to think we were going to end up at Mayflower seafood! Also very cute and intimate location. LOVE the music and vibes of the restaurant. :)
2015-04-21,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Backyard Bistro,"Pre concert. Great logistic choice for food. If you want to get a buzz before concert, know that they short the mixed drinks big time. I ordered seperate shot to complete drink.That's ok. 5% tip made up for it."
2015-04-22,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Oakwood Café,"This delicious little restaurant made for a lovely lunch outside this afternoon the Cuban roasted pork, tostones and yuca were so yummy! I look forward to coming back!"
2015-04-23,4.0,"Durham, NC",Brio Tuscan Grille,"The atmosphere was great, the server Jacob was middle of the road, but friendly.The dirty martini was served a little clean but came out quick which is an ok trade off.  The bruschetta quatro was good. My chopped salad was soggy and room temperature. My sister who ordered the chicken sorentine off the special menu was served with cold tomato sauce and the medallions that I ordered had the texture of ground beef and the gravy seemed made from Heinz. For dessert the chocolate ""molten"" dessert tasted like a little debbie cosmic brownie topped with gelato. The food, which I give a 4 out of 10 generously would have been tolerated being I had a great time with the people I was with. However, the manager on duty that I did not get the name single handedly made myself and the others I was with resolve that we will NEVER come back to Brio ever. We split the bill three ways and there was a complication with my card and the charges were declined. To avoid making it seem like I am just trying to get revenge, we will just say that my card was declined. The manager brought me to the POS, in front of other guests and staff and told me to swipe my card myself so that I could see for myself that it was declined. Completely unprofessional. In an already embarrassing moment for me, he made it worse by coming out to the table and saying to the people I was with that I was rude to him. I have been in the restaurant business for 15 years and I have never seen anyone treat a guest in this fashion. If the food was at the least good it would be difficult for me to not go back there, but since the food was sub-standard its an easy choice to never go back."
2015-04-24,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Flights Restaurant & Lounge,"For a hotel restaurant I was pleasantly surprised. The staff from the hostess to the server were exceptionally friendly! This restaurant takes a slightly chic approach to its decor with its high back chairs, pillows and over sized windows. I would love to dine at night. I had breakfast here and it was delicious. Everything from the Mixed Berry shooter that's provided before your meal, to my OJ and bacon! For entree I ordered the Carolina Cakes (batter mixed with Nutella, bananas and blueberries) not usually a fan of sweets but this was a pleasant surprise for my taste buds! The cakes were hot and fluffy and the consistency of the batter was perfect! If hubby and I stay here again I'll definitely order these again. Oh - quick note for my bacon lovers - the bacon was hot crispy and you get lots of pieces with your side order! My server was so sweet and timely with water and everything else. Five stars for this hidden hotel restaurant!"
2015-04-24,4.0,"Hillsborough, NC",The Roast Grill,"I've had better hot dogs in my life. Maybe even a better hot dog here in Raleigh. But the Roast Grill truly does it right, and has been, for the past 75 years!As you've probably heard, this spot was featured on Man v. Food, but the Roast Grill carries a reputation that transcends that. Inside this hybrid house/building-thing, a man and his wife run an old-fashioned hot dog joint. With only 4 things on the menu, they stick to their guns.Each hot dog is $2.50 with your choice/combo of mustard/onions/chili. The slaw is 25¢ extra. The hot dogs here don't have that distinct ""snap"" to them as I'd prefer, but the whole thing just melts in your mouth. Before you know it, you've eaten 3-4 hot dogs like it's nothing. The chili is fantastic, and I do suggest trying their mayo-less slaw.Try not to come during rush hour, and you're golden. Oh, and no ketchup!"
2015-04-24,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Randy’s Pizza,"I have been coming here since they opened a few years ago. The slices are huge! 2 slices and drink for under 7 bucks. It's definitely the best pizza that I have found in Raleigh. Closest to north Jersey / NY pizza that I have found. The place is clean, staff are friendly. They even remember my name. You will not be disappointed at this pizza place."
2015-04-24,4.0,"Hillsborough, NC",Brio Tuscan Grille,This has got to be one of my new favorite Italian restaurants. It was the first time me and a few fellow nursing students tried the restaurant. The only down side was that service. The server wasn't as attentive to our needs but we did come at lunch so that could have played a huge factor on the Quality of service. I would definitely recommend this restaurant
2015-04-25,4.0,"Greensboro, NC",MoJoe’s Burger Joint,"Burger places are popping up all over the place these days and it is getting more difficult to separate the beef from the chaff. I had looked this place up previously to taking a trip to the state's capital city. It was a rainy day and we arrived right around 12:30 and at the time it was pretty dead inside...I was surprised considering it was a weekend and it was lunch time. It also seemed like there was a way over abundance of staff lingering around...another bad sign, or so I thought. There is an outdoor seating section with umbrella covered tables and then a covered and heated patio area which serves as a dining area before you make your way into the main dining area which is tiny and could be cramped when crowded.The menu is straight forward with colorful burger names such as ""The Inferno"", ""The Carnivore"", ""Pork Pile"" and ""The S'mush"" to name a few. One cool thing is that each of these burgers can be ordered in your own config - don't like beef? then order a veggie Inferno. Don't like veggie burger? Then order a chicken S'mush or Turkey burger S'mush. The rest of the menu is standard pub fare with sandwhiches, salads, wings, etc. The beer list is extensive with many local brews and big name national brews. There is definitely enough selection for anyone. They also have iced tea and they serve Coke products. I ordered the ""The Inferno"" which is a 6oz burger with blackened Cajun seasonings, grilled onions, grilled jalapenos and pepper jack cheese. My friend had the same but, had it in the chicken configuration. We also split a basket of cheese fries.Let me state that all the staff that I thought was lingering around turned out to be a well-oiled machine. Efficient with refills and checking to see how the food was. They were johnny-on-the-spot and the service was very good. The food arrived in about ten minutes after placing our order. Everything looked good enough to eat. The burger was cooked all the way through and I was not asked how I wanted it cooked so, I was stuck with well-done as I did not see any pink inside my burger. This made the burger a tad dry and the jalapenos did not appear to be grilled all that much but, in the end it didn't matter because the burger was very tasty. The cheese fries were of the crinkle cut variety and served hot but, the cheese stuck to the top of the fries and because of that there was no cheese on the fries at the bottom of the basket. This was bummer because they don't use cheese sauce and it was tasty. The fries were seasoned just right and along with the burger they disappeared in short order. Upon leaving, the once nearly empty place was nearly full and bustling with activity from the finely oiled machine of the wait staff. All in all, my experience was pleasant and enjoyable. While not the best burger I have had, it certainly wasn't the worst either. I still would go to Bad Daddy's before MoJoe's but, my real preference would be the Wooden Nickel in Hillsborough."
2015-04-25,2.0,"Durham, NC",Casa Carbone Ristorante Italiano,"I was very excited to give Casa Carbone a try. I did not read the reviews beforehand but saw that it averaged four stars. I had high hopes.After my dinner there, I truly do not understand why it has four stars. I would never return.First, the decor. A couple of people have commented on how old and outdated the decor is. Yes, it is truly old and needs to be updated. The entire restaurant needs a make over. But I could live with outdated decor if the food was good.Before we get to the food, let's discuss service. I was with a group of six. We were seated promptly. However, we didn't see a server for at least five minutes. When I say we didn't see one I mean we didn't see anyone. No one was around for awhile.Our server did show up and was ok. He was able to answer questions about the food but was less helpful when it came to drink orders. He just didn't know very much about the wine and didn't offer to find someone who could be helpful. Food came out promptly and once it did he disappeared. There was someone who was coming around and refilling water, but once we got our entrees that person also disappeared. We were back to being all by ourselves.Now, the food. I had a Caesar salad and it was pretty bad. Another reviewer noted that the salads seemed pre-made. I'm going to agree with that. The salad was definitely not fresh. Lettuce was edible, and I'm gonna leave it at that. The Parmesan cheese on the salad was probably Kraft from a bottle or something similar.Next up I had the spaghetti with tomato sauce. What appealed to me about this dish was that the menu said the sauce had been simmering for hours. I checked this out with the waiter before ordering it, and he confirmed for me that this was one of THE dishes to order.I got plenty of spaghetti for my money (8.00). But in no way was there anything fresh about this meal. The pasta definitely came from a box, and the sauce came from a can. To be fair, the menu never claimed that anything was fresh just that the sauce had been simmering for hours. It was very bland.They do not put parm on the spaghetti. When I inquired about it, the waiter informed me there was a bottle of cheese on the table and that this was, ""not the Olive Garden."" I guess the Olive Garden is a step up? Not sure what he meant by that except don't expect any freshly grated cheese in any format. I struggled with giving this one star or two because the food is technically edible. But since there is no way I would go back here I decided to give it one. I am not sure how this place manages to stay in business given the awful food and old decor."
2015-04-25,4.0,"Salem, VA",Poppyseed Market,First time in Raleigh and heard from a friend about this cool little spot! Had the salmon special with spaghetti squash and a cold tomato cucumber salad. Absolutely delicious! Great wine selection and craft beers. Be back for sure!
2015-04-25,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Cameron Bar and Grill,"Nice casual atmosphere, but still fine dining.  I really wish this could become my regular spot. I keep coming back even though service and food are variable.Most recent visit. Ordered risotto, rice was undercooked, and too heavy on cream. Salmon was perfect.  Friend had chicken which was extremely moist (oddly enough, too moist); the more standard options are the way to go here.Service was slow even though it wasn't busy."
2015-04-25,2.0,"Tampa, FL",Sawasdee Thai Restaurant,Very mixed reviews from fellow yelps yet we decided to check it out.Price is very reasonable unlike some mentioned of the pricy concerns.Lunch special was under $10.00 with choices of side dishes.Green curry and pat-thai tofu were our choices. Curry was so watery and lacking to cover ver-portikned rice and lacking the flavor. Pat-thai was nothing but soy sauce and very salty. Make the story short: I ended up throwing up twice within 30 min. Please avoid this place unless you are stranded and about to die with hunger
2015-04-25,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Rockford,"Wow, it's been a while since my last visit to the Rockford but this Raleigh classic is still knocking out some great food.  I popped in for a lunch time visit and the place still has a slightly boho chic look to the space but refreshed.  The hipster staff is still here but the menu has changed up some more.  Sandwiches in the $8 - $10 range with sides at about $3.  I order up a farmer's plate (3 sides) of zucchini straws, fried broccoli and mac n cheese.  A Little Piggy sandwich for my main and we are ready to eat!  The plate of sides is beautiful, generous portions of each.  Loved the fried broccoli which are seared with some savory spices and the mac n cheese was amped up with some middle eastern flavors.  My sandwich was excellent: thin-sliced pork with aioli, jalapeno on a sweetened brioche bun, yum! All I can say is that the Rockford continues to surprise me in a good way.  Usually a restaurant this long-lived gets stale over time but not this place.  While the value isn't quite as amazing as it used to be (sandwiches don't come with a side), the overall quality of what they're dishing out is still excellent.  So rock on, Rockford!"

My other half enjoyed jerk chicken, mac-and-cheese and greens for lunch. He also purchased a dinner entree with smothered turkey wings and the same sides. I cook some amazing turkey wings, so he said those at Lee's were just okay. He explained they needed a bit more seasoning. Otherwise, we were happy campers and neither of us had to cook. ;-)"
2015-04-26,5.0,"Miami, FL",Randy’s Pizza,"Perfect NY style pizza!  We had cheese and pepperoni slices (huge!), garlic knots and cannoli.  The pizza was thin, crust was crispy and sauce and toppings were delicious!  The garlic knots were soft and practically floating in olive oil and garlic, and the cannolis were fantastic as well - we tried one chocolate and one regular.  This will be our go-to pizza place from now on!"
2015-04-26,3.0,"Fayetteville, NC",Midtown Grille,First time visit to this gem. The pre-dinner Manhattan was expertly crafted. The food was amazing. The service was on point. The CAB fillet was excellent. The oysters were tremendous although I could have taken more of the cucumber kimchi on the side. This gets put on the go to list. Just a great restaurant!
2015-04-26,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tarbouch,"SIMPLY THE BEST IN RALEIGH. This has become our favorite go to place for lunch and dinner. The food quality is quite amazing- fresh, delicious AND AUTHENTIC!  With every single bite of anything you select from this menu, it just gets better.  I am going to have a hard time not eating here or ordering delivery everyday. Also, the owner is really just the nicest person you ever want to meet. He delivered food to our home after I had been traveling for work for a solid month, it honestly tasted as if he had prepared right here in our kitchen. Do yourself and your palate a favor, don't pass this place by."
2015-04-27,4.0,"Pope Field, NC",Alpaca Peruvian Charcoal Chicken,"This was delicious. I wish I had two stomachs right now. I mean seriously, nice big portions. A quarter chicken with two sides easilyyyyyy fed myself, my husband, and my one year old. I really can't wait to go back."

2015-04-29,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Roast Grill,"The Roast Grill is a museum, a time capsule that's open 6 days a week from 11:00-4:00. They've been in business since 1940 (75 years!), and dining at this establishment will lead the customer to consider what the outskirts of downtown Raleigh must have been like 75 years ago. The whole place reads like a timeline from when they first started (prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor), up until today. The register and bar look like they may actually be from 1940. I'm a tall fella, and I really had to contort my 6'4 frame to fit into the bar stool. The exterior looks like something out of the 50s, with no understanding from back then that ""Hot Weiners"" could mean anything but some grilled pork with chili. The grill honestly looks like it could be this old as well. The hand drawn menu/pricing looks like something from the 60s. I think the same could be said for the flooring. The old timey commerative Coca-Cola cans for various Triangle college team's successes over the years has a late 70s-early 80s feel. The adoption of a no Ketchup, hot dog only personality by the proprietor harkens back to a certain 90s episode of Seinfeld about a grumpy soup chef, as well as echoing the determined unflexibile nature of Cheese Steak joints on South Street in Philly. And the documentation of reality shows visiting the place all over the back wall brings memories back of reality shows from the oughts. Similarly, the fact that there's a gay bar across the street shows how Raleigh has changed over time. And just to bring it full circle, the suggestion to befriend the establishment on Facebook, or advertise them on your car with a sticker that just reads ""RG"" reminds you of the current decade. But there's something more here. All of this time passed, all of these artifacts, and it seems like the place is always run by a guy with a woman who I'm assuming is his mom. Neither are young. And if you are a sensitive weirdo wimp like myself, you may just feel the weight that is in this tiny restaurant. This isn't only a job for these people. This has been their life. Eating at this restaurant is liking poking your head into the life of two people that have been doing this same thing every day. It's touching, wistful, and everyone in the area should check this place out at least once. It's like the movie ""Boyhood,"" except it would have to be titled ""Hot Doghood"" instead. For example, do you miss your grandparents? Go here, and you may just feel like you're in your grandparents kitchen for a little while. Got baby boomer parents who wish things were like they used to be? Go here, and let them wallow in that fantasy a while. For the non-sentimal non-weirdo types: the hot dogs are good. The chili is good. It's cheap. 2 hot dogs and a bottled coke only cost $6.00, there's a hot dog place downtown that charges more than that for one hot dog. If you're from Chicago or Germany, then you probably won't be too impressed by them, but they're perfectly fine. I can't wait to bring any family member that visits Raleigh to this living museum. Let them enjoy the old-fashioned ambiance, giggle at the grumpy hot dog slingers, and learn that a hot dog don't need no damn ketchup."
2015-04-29,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sawasdee Thai Restaurant,"Thai cusine does not mean over powdering spices. Their dishes almost hurt my stomach. Overall food is too saulty and too sweet. Peanut sauce was watery, very sweet. Thai tea taste bland. If this is the best Thai place like other Yelpers saying, I will hold on to my crave for Thai until I travel other cities."
2015-04-29,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Vivace,I dined here with a friend for lunch and we both ordered the house salad with salmon. The salad was so delicious I scarfed it down without breathing. I can't believe how good it was. I am still thinking about that salad now. The salmon was seasoned well and the lemon vinaigrette didn't drown out the other ingredients on the salad.I know they have other things on their menu and I will try them at some point after I grow tired of the salad...:-)
2015-04-30,4.0,"San Francisco, CA",Char-Grill,"Well, hey y'all. Jamie Dubya and I finally arrived in Raleigh from the Left Coast pert near midnight, and we was starvin' 'cause all we had was a squeeze tube of hummus and a few crackers on the plane ride over. Sho'nuff, pickin's were awfully slim for us after we checked into our room at the Red Roof. Even the night clerk there was catching some winks while he was checkin' us in. I found word about Char-Grill not on Yelp but on Roadfood.com where they identify all the greasy spoons you may want to stop at as you travel the highways and byways in this great land of ours, the good ole U.S. of A. It didn't take us more than fifteen minutes to get there, and what we saw was a very retro-lookin' drive-in, completely empty of customers like something out of ""The Twilight Zone"".I mean the original, black-and-white Rod Serling version where the gremlin was chewing on William Shatner's airplane wing. It turns out Char-Grill was born in 1960 at this very location, so I wasn't that far off. The current owners, Mahlon Aycock and Ryon Wilder, have had it since 1975, and you can tell they don't mess around with a formula that works for them. It's quite an eccentric albeit self-protective ordering system out here. You take one of their long forms, check off what you want and slip it through a window slot and down a chute where the cook takes it and starts making your order. I ordered their classic, the $7.99 1/2-lb. Hamburger Steak Burger with Cheese that comes with Fries and a Medium Drink. Flames were shooting up to the ceiling as he was grilling my order (photo: bit.ly/1QN9mtd).Jamie got all domestic on me and ordered a two-fer - the $2.89 Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato Sandwich served on a hamburger bun and the $2.09 Grilled Cheese on an English muffin bun (photo: bit.ly/1ETF0SW). Both were homespun good for fast-food options. Mine hit the spot at the midnight hour. Certainly meaty enough and not overly greasy since there are ridges on their grill to let the fat flow out. It was slathered big time in mayo which acted like glue for the mounds of lettuce epoxied to the sesame seed bun (photo: bit.ly/1Ajn78C). Oh I get it, that was the slaw. Nothing like a $1.39 Deep-Fried Apple Pie to finish the meal (photo: bit.ly/1EEMyH8). We were eating at one of the red picnic tables when it started to rain in a torrential downpour. We waited for it to lighten up as they were fixin' to close the place for the night. Welcome to North Carolina, y'all!FOOD - 4 stars...it's all in the grillin'...burger is like a deluxe version of a WhopperAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...well, it's a drive-in so it depends on your own nostalgia...mine included A&W drive-ins so I was at homeSERVICE - 4 stars...actually quite friendly through the windowTOTAL - 4 stars...not sure if this is the best burger in those parts but for a midnight craving, it works in a pinch"
2015-04-30,5.0,"Durham, NC",Casa Carbone Ristorante Italiano,Food was nothing special.  I'm not a great Italian cook but felt like the food was no better than what I could make. Atmosphere is very dated with very uncomfortable booth seats. Will not be returning.
2015-04-30,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Cameron Bar and Grill,"We wanted a spot in Cameron Village for drinks and an appetizer before an event at Broughton.  We sat at the bar and ordered drinks- nothing special. A positive- I do like that they have nightly specials, like $3 drafts on Thursdays.We checked out the menu and settled on chicken nachos. This is the first time we've ever ordered food here. First, it is a small portion. Don't look for a heaping plate of cheesy nachos here. In fact, the cheese was practically non-existent.  The chicken, which is chipotle braised, is very spicy, understandably, but wasn't shredded. We had a couple of chunks of chicken on our chips, which we ended up shredding with two forks.  Also there was dozens of pickled jalapenos and no sign of the Cholula cream. We asked for sour cream to cut the heat. The bartender said no problem but never returned with it or checked in again. Over all- blah. I'd like to say we'd try again and update, but why? There are too many good restaurants in Cameron Village to bother with a less than mediocre experience again."

2015-05-02,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Rockford,"The Rockford has an amazing location and a mediocre menu.  I went there last night with my husband and another couple.  We were sat immediately and served caramel drizzled, yet spicey popcorn!  Nice start.  We had several different cocktails and beers- the cocktails were slightly overpriced but in par with most places downtown Raleigh.  I ordered a burger with a fried egg (special of the night) with no bun.  We were charged $2 as ""Food Prep"" for the bun to not be served on my plate.....interesting.The food was 4 out of 5 stars.  Great mac and cheese.  Delicious BBQ, greek salad, and zucchini straws.  DO NOT GET the kale salad.  It was inundated with onions, had little to no dressing, and was served with chopped red peppers that added no flavor. Pretty disappointing!  Oh and we actually ordered a dessert dish, the Lemon Tarte with raspberry cream.  It was like a small angel food cake that tasted like it had been made about a week ago and left uncovered.  We told the server it tasted old and he apologized, and it was still on our tab.  Oh well.....I don't think we'll visit The Rockford again.Great location with great views, but all else is underwhelming."

They were so flexbile and able to accomodate us even when our group grew from 15 to 27! We were asked to do a fixed menu, which made me a little nervous since I knew I had some vegetarians that were going to be dining with us, but even that was accomodated with ease. Now, on to the food - I had the salmon, but tasted the chicken and lamb as well and all I can say is that I will be back time and again for celebrations and date nights...food was SPECTACULAR and cooked to perfection. Many, many thanks to Chad and Steven for helping me make my sister's birthday extra special!"

2015-05-05,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Jimmy V’s Osteria & Bar,"Good food but wasn't super impressed with the service. My boss and I arrived for lunch on Friday around 12:30PM and was told there would be a twenty minute wait despite the fact that there were plenty of free seats (isn't that a no-no for places that specialize in working lunches? After all what business lets you have THAT much time for a lunch break?). We shrugged it off (maybe they were understaffed?) and took a seat in the connected hotel and waited....And waited....And waited....No one ever filled all those empty seats so after about 35 minutes I went to the hostess and asked how long it would be. She gave me a 'oh crap we forgot about you' look and quickly ushered us to our seats (one of the previously unoccupied tables). After that we waited about ten more minutes for someone to come offer us drinks. Admittedly once we got our drinks things sped up a bit. Our waitress was by no means extraordinary (she basically did the bare minimum and was absent the rest of the time) but we received our meals (pizzas) pretty quickly, and they were actually very good! I really enjoyed my fig and pear pizza, as it was full of flavor and crispy (just how I like it!). We also decided on a few dessert items which consisted of the tiramisu and fruit and cream. The tiramisu was very good but the cream with fruit was almost sickingly sweet. I ate about half before the sugar jitters kicked in and I had to stop. The fruit was all very fresh though! Also random note: I don't know if we didn't get it for some specific reason but they never seemed to offer us any of the bread that everyone else seemed to have...We probably would have declined thanks to our already carb-full meal, but I just noticed walking out that everyone else seemed to be enjoying it. Odd..All in all, unless work is paying I don't think i'd come back. The service was just not there."
2015-05-05,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Rockford,"I have tried getting to-go food here twice. I took their recommendation and got the ABC, which was HORRIBLE. Why would you put french toast as the actual bread? It was hard to eat, soggy and not enough cheese. I got the mac n cheese for a side, the noodles were overcooked and the cheese sauce was broken. The second time I ordered to-go wasn't as bad as the first time. I got the grilled romaine, not grilled and mac n cheese to see if they had improved since the first time. The salad wasn't so bad, except the romaine had not been washed and there was not enough dressing. The romaine had been precut so it had turned brown by the time I went to eat it. The Mac n cheese was a disappointment, again. Different style of noodles, still over cooked, broken sauce and under seasoned. Maybe it was disappointing because I got the food to-go but I work a block away, so it shouldn't be that bad. I think I am going to stick to 1/2 off hotdog day at Snoopy's."

While Night Kitchen may be hard to find since it's tucked away at Seaboard, definitely make an effort to seek out this place if you're in the hood.  It's a worthwhile addition to the Oak City food scene, who can resist a sweet temptation every now and then?"

I really like their pizzas and salads. I'm not a big pasta eater and enjoy that they have a lot of variety on the menu.Eating out on their patio is fantastic, now that the weather is warm this is the first place I think about when dining al fresco. The service is always superb and I feel well taken care of. I stopped in for lunch on the patio today and our server made sure we had everything we needed. I couldn't believe how fast our food came out this is a go to place for a quick lunch.I ordered the house salad with salmon. A very generous portion of fresh greens, tomatoes, red onions, ricotta salata and a light lemon dressing. The salmon was cooked perfectly and for $12 I think this was quite a deal.The bread they serve with hummus which is such a nice change from the usual butter. I recently tried their mushroom flatbread as well and it was really tasty. Vivace puts out some quality food in a great environment. Get outside and enjoy this nice weather on the patio before it gets to hot."

We were happy to see him so happy. Our food was as good as it could be in the given situation. I even had a few spoons full of the chocolate milkshake. If I hadn't been so sad, it would have had more of an impact. But, it was really delicious.I've been to the other locations and the food is just as tasty.

My husband and I are always on the lookout for good places to eat that don't break the bank, and O'Malley's is a welcome addition to our list!The restaurant is located in a plaza, so it's hard to find if you're not looking for it. The dining area is pretty tiny -- low ceilings probably don't help. We came here for the first time on a Saturday night. The place wasn't too crowded. There was a live band playing, which was nice. We picked a booth away from the bar. O'Malley's has great service and an impressive beer list -- lots of crafts. I had a couple Fat Tires.For dinner, I had the fish sandwich with sweet potato fries. My husband had the shepard's pie. My sandwich was delicious -- and it was only $8! What's not to love?! The sweet potato fries were seasoned perfectly. I could taste the brown sugar/cinnamon, but it wasn't overpowering. I had a few bites of the shepard's pie, as well. Small portion, but very hearty. I think our total bill (dinner for two, four beers and two shots) was under 40 bucks.We'll definitely be back!"

2015-05-10,5.0,"Apex, NC",Donatos Raleigh,"I was hanging out at Brew Coffee when my stomach started growling. The Yelp app found for me the nearest pizza place and off I went. The reviews were staggering. Having never been to a Donatos, I felt I was in for a real treat.Placed my order for a personal Hawaiian Pizza. It featured shaved ham, pineapple, almonds and cinnamon - and a Pepsi to top it off. The place was empty so I had my pick of seating while I waited. They get a plus for nice lighting and relative cleanliness. Then the minus for the seating, which is more of a petty nitpick from me than anything else. I had merely noticed that the tables have two arrangements: wayout in the open public or shifted far into the corners, away from all civilization. As I said...nitpicking.Fifteen minutes of Angry Birds and my pie arrived. The lady behind the counter was sunny and helpful. She offered hot pepper and a cup of ice, neither of which were on my mind so it was nice to kinda be ""reminded"" that I wanted them. Good customer service.I'm no stranger to Hawaiian pies, but they're not my favorite. I only picked it because a couple people on this site raved about them and it had been awhile. The crust was thin and a little crunchy, which I never like, ever. And the presentation wasn't beautiful. The toppings tried to make up for it all with wonderful flavor. I loved the shaved ham and the pineapple was thankfully underpowering. But whoever had the idea to include cinnamon utterly failed me here. It seriously didn't do the good vibes any favors. Should I return, I'll request that they kibosh the cinnamon."
2015-05-10,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Daily Planet Cafe,"The Daily Planet Cafe is a gem.  A diamond in the rough.  A needle in a haystack.  A quality fast food spot tucked away in a location easily accessible by two gastronomically underserved populations: beleaguered museum-going families and long-suffering state employees from nearby government buildings on the periphery of downtown Raleigh's food orbit.There's just so much to love about this place.  The menu selection (and daily specials) are on point.  The food is appealing in that straightforward, good-n-greasy manner you come to expect from a grill joint, but with superb culinary flourishes (the delicately flaky tempura, the infused aioli, the lovingly caramelized onions) that demonstrate the care with which the lead chef develops the menu and operates his kitchen.  The fried items are fried clean, without that old-grill-oil taste typical of other institutional snack bars.  The ordering and pick-up process is relatively quick and efficient, even during the insanity of lunch hour.  The folks at the museum have accomplished a rare feat-- hosting a quality eatery in an environment where they have a natural monopoly and lack any real incentive to provide good food.  I say more power to 'em, and more business for that matter."

I'm not usually a burrito person but I decided to try the carne asada burrito after reading great reviews on here and I've got to say, it's pretty dang good. It's pretty much just steak, guacamole, and pico -- so simple yet so good. Their plain churros were also the best churros I've ever had in my life. The Mexican soda was awesome, too. This place is very authentic and reasonably priced. Definitely recommend!"
2015-05-10,5.0,"Wilmington, NC",Mo-Te Vietnamese Restaurant,"This has quickly become one of my favorite places in Raleigh. This authentic Vietnamese restaurant is not at all modern or chic, but rather a place that you go for legitimate food and not so much for the ambiance. With that being said, their chicken Bahn Mi is phenomenal and their bubble tea is one of my favorite things in the world. Their selection of boba is insane and is sure to satisfy any craving you have. I love the family that owns this place too, very sweet people and will remember you if you're a regular.  I highly recommend this place!"

My sister made a reservation, so we had no problem being quickly seated. I can't remember our waiter's name, but he was great and attentive our entire visit. The Bang Bang Shrimp were delicious as always. 3 out of 4 of us ordered the California omelet, while the 4th had the egg burger. While the taste of the omelet wasn't bad at all, it was surprisingly flat and lacking in the amount of filling. And I'm pretty sure my omelet had no cheese at all, when the other two did. I have a slight fear of sending food back to the kitchen, so I didn't mention it to the waiter. Plus my potatoes au gratin were cheesy enough to make up for it. With this being the first mishap I've experienced at this location I will definitely be back."

2015-05-11,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Saint Jacques,"I had an amazing dining experience at Saint Jacques on Mothers Day. The service was absolutely incredible and flawless.  There was so much attention to detail in how the food was served and how each course was properly prepped for. It was definitely some of the best service I've ever had from a high end restaurant. For Mother's Day, there was a three course meal for $55 a person. I chose the French onion soup, braised short rib, and chocolate raspberry marquise. Overall, the food was amazing with great depths of flavor in each course.  Although French food is known to come in small portions, I was very full after the three courses. I started off with the French onion soup, which only felt right at a French restaurant. The soup was awesome. The broth was so tasty and the onions were perfectly cooked and caramelized. The Gruyere cheese imported from France really brought the soup to another level. It was so good I had to get an extra piece of baguette to soak up the soup. My mom ordered the mussels in a white wine sauce, and it was also very good. The sauce was so light, yet had a great creamy flavor that really complemented the mussels well without overpowering it. It was a true French classic. For my entree, I had the braised short rib. The short rib was extremely tender, tender enough to cut with a fork. The sauce was really good and you tell they deglazed the pan with a red wine because all those favors were in the sauce. The carmelized onions on top of the beef made the dish. They were so rich in flavor and the wine used to carmelize them was incredible. The beef was served on top of a perfectly cooked risotto with a side of carrots. Overall, the dish was a great success and very filling. The chocolate raspberry marquise was extremely rich and delicious. It is basically a thick and rich dark chocolate mouse that was served over a sweet raspberry sauce.  The chocolate was definitely the star of the dessert end is perfect for any dark chocolate lover. I also tried some of the bacon salted caramel ice cream. If you love bacon, you have to have this!  The bacon flavor is incredibly strong. It literally tastes like you're eating bacon instead of ice cream.  You can really taste the quality of the bacon and how it was perfectly cooked and infused into the ice cream. I love bacon and thought it was a masterpiece. Overall, I would highly recommend Saint Jacques. It was a definite 5 stars and one of the best dining experiences I've ever had."

Inside you'll find that the place reeks of authenticity, patrons are mostly latino which is always a good sign to me.  The smallish lunch menu is the basics, tacos, burritos and more, I go off the usual path and do a mochaca con huevo which is basically a beef and egg scramble.  While the lunch prices at Tacos y Mariscos is a touch higher than I'm used to, when my plate comes out I understand.  It's a ton of food, lots of beef and egg, beans, rice, avocado slices, jalapenos and some tortillas to munch it down with.  The meal is really quite good and service excellent so I was a happy boy. So gosh, Tacos Y Mariscos Vallarta, I can't believe this is my first meal here.  As much as I still love Los Cuates, this place is another good option for Mexican in the area, don't miss out!"

2015-05-13,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",ORO Restaurant & Lounge,"Saturday night date night dinner. It could have been impossible so last minute, but thankfully Oro had room for reservations on Open Table so we pulled it off. We were taken upstairs where there was a row of two tops along the wall. I was impressed by the decor -- open spaces with simple white chairs/tables and hanging modern light fixtures, but not how closely these tables were crammed in next to each other. I'm a slim girl, but even me turning sideways to get between our table and the one next ours, made my dress/bag bump into the gentleman of the couple next to us. Oops. I apologized and was embarrassed even though it wasn't my fault because of that tight setup. It simply could not be avoided. In addition to water, we each had a nice adult beverage. He had a Malbec. As for me, it just felt like a cocktail kind of night so I had the Lady in Red: vodka, strawberries, rosemary simple syrup, and honey. $10. Lovely vodka cocktail.We started off with the Strawberry Salad and Duck & Waffles from the Chef's Features section of the menu. The Strawberry Salad is a vegetarian/gluten free item. It had mixed greens, feta cheese, and the balsamic vinaigrette was already mixed in with just the right amount of flavor. for $9. Superb. The Duck & Waffles was just that: 3 duck drumsticks and a half of a waffle with rosemary glaze and herb salted butter flavoring for $17. The flavor was fantastic and the waffles were absolutely wonderful, but we felt like the duck meat was a little sparse. Next, we shared the fish tacos and pork belly from the Sea and Land, respectively. For $12, the fish tacos came with 3 flour tortilla tacos. I'm pretty sure the fish was tilapia. The tacos had a real kick to 'em with the cucumber sticks, mango salsa, wasabi guacamole, and sriracha. These were really fabulous fish tacos with the way they were cooked and the flavoring enhancing them. If only we did not have the cut the third in half... The pork belly was carmelized pork demi. The sauce was really sweet and tangy, but the meat, served in little squares, was a little tough. Good flavor and temp, but too tough.Finally, I just had to have that Truffle Mac & Cheese from the Garden section of the menu. This vegetarian item was made with yellow & white cheddar cheese and fine herbs for $9. At this point, I got up to use the restroom. Throughout our meal, we'd kept our conversation levels very low because of how close in proximity all the tables were, but also because we're not extremely loud people when we're out dining, unlike some people. We could hear nearly every word from our neighbors, but I did my best to tune them out. As I was about to get up, I said, ""I'm going to go find the restroom."" The girl in the couple with the gentleman, I'd previously tapped, then took it upon herself to interject and tell me where the restroom was. I was astonished, but just nodded and walked away as I whispered into my date's ear, ""That was weird."" Nothing to write home with the bathroom. Same simple black and white design throughout the restaurant.Overall, I'd say our experience was okay. The food was really good while also lacking in some areas, as mentioned. See my pictures for more imagery with that delicious flavor! In both instances, I could have licked the sauces off the plates of the pork belly, waffles, and strawberry salad, but I contained myself.Oro tries to pack too many people into a space that already doesn't have great acoustics which doesn't prove for an outstanding easygoing dining experience. If I went back again, I'd ensure that I was downstairs in an area away from other tables, but even that would be tough. I've already actually dined down there, a couple years ago when I came with a couple other girls. The high ceilings with hardwood floors and too many people makes it awfully loud. Tapas isn't terribly cheap either. We enjoyed our dining experience overall and our server was very sweet though."
2015-05-13,4.0,"Cary, NC",Tarbouch,Great food and people. Come here often and never disappointed. Friendly service. Can't go wrong with their Gyros. The owner works very hard to make sure his customers are taken care of.
2015-05-13,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Backyard Bistro,"Went here with two of my girlfriends the other night.Service was top-notch- that gets a 5.  Our server was so sweet and attentive.The food was okay.The ""Battle of the Bands"" was happening and we were sitting outside watching.  We were really only there for the first band and they left a lot to be desired.   The crowd was a very eclectic mix. I think this is a good venue if you want to watch sporting events or special things like the bands that play here. But I'm uncertain you would come just for the food.  My friend was here Super Bowl Sunday and they really enjoyed it then."
2015-05-14,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Cariokos Rotisserie Chicken,"Excellent food, excellent service, a simple menu, and amazing prices. The rotisserie chicken is soo delicious. The tostones remind me of my Latin American heritage. I will be coming here often to sample everything they have!"
2015-05-14,5.0,"Denver, CO",The Borough,Strongest drinks in town. Best bar/restaurant in Raleigh. How do you beat half price apps every weekday...?! Always amazing. Giant portions. Great staff- always amazing. I worship The Borough.
2015-05-14,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tarbouch,"I yelped this place in a pinch while in the middle of a move, and its a great option for some healthy, mediterannean fast casual. Good greek salads and chicken, etc and its Mom and Pop run. Food is reasonably priced and made in a timely fashion."
2015-05-14,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",PDQ,"PDQ is the cleanliest fast food restaurant in the business.   Their chicken tenders are fresh and served hot.  They have very skinny fries that are pretty good with malt vinegar, and a little sea salt.  The made two extra chocolate shakes for another customer, and gave it to me free of charge.  The shake was thick and tasty.   The 3 piece tender meal is almost 8 bucks, but it's worth it."
2015-05-15,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Los Cuates,"I give Los Cuates 5 stars for being delicious, affordable, family owned and accommodating. This is a walk-up food counter, and your chips and food are delivered to your table. This is my go-to spot for catering large group dinners. They sell absolutely delicious made-to-order carnitas, ceviche, and guacamole (and I'm sure more items as well) by the pound, and they supply  all of the necessary fixings to allow you to skip the grocery store (tortillas, chopped onion and cilantro, chips and salsa, even cutlery and napkins if you need it). When I'm not ordering 3lbs of carnitas :) I absolutely love the quesadillas, fish tacos, and burritos. I'm not sure what they do to their carne asada and chicken -- but it is so flavorful! Great people, great food, unparalleled convenience."
2015-05-15,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",PDQ,"Large open dining area. Lots of seating, booths and even stools at the eating bar. Staff if friendly and seemed to like their job! We got the chicken strips and club sandwich. Both were very good, fresh and loved the fries. We'll be back for more."
2015-05-15,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mura,"A friend and I decided to dine here since she heard that Mura's had the best sushi in town. The service was great and the sushi was ok. I made a reservation in open table and when we arrived we were seated immediately. The menu gives a diner the option to go the traditional sushi route or a selection of entrees. I ordered the vegetable tempura roll, dynamite roll, and cucumber roll with brown rice. The food was served quickly and they provided plenty of wasabi which is a plus in my book.The wine selection wasn't that great but I'd done here's again. This is a great place for a date or hanging out with friends."
2015-05-16,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Saltwater Seafood & Fry Shack,"My yelp app helped me find this wonderful hidden treasure. This place is absolutely amazing. My first time visiting and as soon as I walked in I was greeted by employees. When I pulled in parking lot,I wasn't sure if I was in right place. So many people entered in and out. On one side you have fresh frozen seafood and on the opposite side they have the take out window. Prices are good for portion size and they have some great menu options. You can also see and pick your the fresh fish up close and person.I ordered shrimp and tilapia with green beans and coleslaw. Fish and shrimp was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious. Plan to take your order to go. No inside dining which is ok with me. We will differently be returning."
2015-05-16,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tenko Japan,"Tenko has great, cheap hibachi and teriyaki stir fry. I think this is the best quality Japanese food at this price point in Raleigh. If you're trying to lower the sodium content, they will cook your food without soy sauce upon request, and the chicken still comes out juicy! They've recently started charging for extra sauce, so don't get crazy with it."
2015-05-16,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Cameron Bar and Grill,"This place has been around for a while and I am astonished that it's still in business.  The location keeps it relevant and I guess they have enough clientele to keep them afloat and operating.  It's a nice atmosphere and the service is good.  The food on the other hand is terrible and I have stayed away from the place for about 3 years until tonight.  My wife wanted to try something different from our usual take-out and she said Cameron B&G had a new menu.  I was skeptical because every time I have eaten at this restaurant or its similar and equally as terrible cousin (Northridge Pub) the food has been very disappointing.   Time heals wounds, but time can't fix poor quality as long as that is what management decides to offer customers. I got the southern pork nachos and the chips were soggy, there was barely any cheese on the chips and it was covered in low grade pork with a side of the worst BBQ sauce I have ever had.  Seriously, this is NC and you come to the table with that weak ass pork BBQ!!!  The lady that took my order over phone said it was a large portion and it could feed two people.  I consider myself a moderate eater and I hate you tell you lady friend put the portion size would leave two people starving and ordering a pizza, or worse ordering more food from your restaurant.  It was an appetizer but come the fuck on...  My wife got the Cobb Salad which was an extremely small portion and was unimpressive.  It looked like a side salad that cost $9.50.My advice to management is pay a bit more attention to detail, buy better quality meat, produce, etc and adjust your portion sizes.  Oh yeah, and take some pride in what you sell even if it's take out!"
2015-05-16,3.0,"Germantown, MD",Sawasdee Thai Restaurant,Delish! Good quality ingredients and great flavor! Plenty of options on the menu.  Cute decor.
2015-05-17,2.0,"Virginia Beach, VA",Vivace,I would have rather gone to golden corral.  The spaghetti tasted like golden corrals.  Plain and simple.  Over cooked by chefs om cell phones.  The veal was also over cooked and tasteless.  Mushy pasta along with it.  Ten dollars a glass for wine thats ten dollars a bottle other places.  Come on Raleigh dont you have better to offer than this!!!!
2015-05-17,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Vivace,"Yum.  Any restuarant that can make brussel sprouts taste amazing is a place everyone should try!  The fig and prosciutto pizza was delicious. I am very discerning when it comes to good food, I usually end up unhappy and wishing I were back in Chicago so I could find good food. However, vivace was a great find and the food and stmosphere was very nice. The wait staff was amazing. Its a great plae to meet friends. Get there early as the outdoor seating fills up quickly.  I cant wait to go back again."
2015-05-17,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Capital Club 16,"The only restaurant I have and probably will ever give five stars. I ate here literally once a week for my last fall and spring semesters at NC State, and I was only disappointed once and they allowed me to get a different entree. The food is really freaking good, especially for brunch. I always recommend the specials or the schnitzel sandwich or the kale grilled cheese. Brunch on Sunday's are fantastic - get the meat plate, swear to god. I have eaten at literally every restaurant in downtown Raleigh. No lie, and this one is always bringing me back because of the atmosphere, wait staff and food. The fries are SO GOOD. I am moving in the fall and this is what I'll miss most about Raleigh"
2015-05-18,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Babylon Restaurant,"For the atmosphere Babylon is 5 stars all the way. You will not find a better outdoor patio the at Babylon. It reminds me of a hotel bar in LA and you definitely don't feel like you are in Raleigh. I've been to Babylon several times now mostly for cocktails and once for a Yelp event. I came with a group of 6 this past weekend for dinner. We made a reservation for 8:15pm. They had some large parties that night and we were eventually sat around 8:40 but was super happy that they were able to get us an outdoor table then sitting inside on this beautiful night. The French 75 cocktail is delicious and I also sipped on a nice Rose throughout the night. Our waiter was very good and made sure we were taken care of well. We started off with the mushroom bruschetta which was absolutely delicious I would definitely order it again, My friend ordered the vegetarian couscous and the tuna which they both enjoyed. My BF and I tried the lamb skewers and chicken tagine. The flavor of the lamb was great and I really liked the dipping sauce, I think this dish would have been great if the lamb was cooked properly but it was overcooked and pretty tough to eat. The chicken tagine was just ok I probably wouldn't order it again.I really think Babylon is one of the most unique spots to dine and drink in the Raleigh area and it's definitely worth visiting. For apps and drinks I'm all in but not my first choice for a full meal. I do want to check out the brunch which I heard is really good.If the weather is right don't miss out on this beautiful patio, it's quite a treat."
2015-05-18,3.0,"Orlando, FL",42nd Street Oyster Bar & Seafood Grill,Great airport food from a local seafood restaurant. I was recommended this location by a colleague and was pleasantly impressed with their delicious food. They have an excellent seafood bisque and I was amazed at how good it tasted. Definitely will stop by here for dinner again with my work travels.
2015-05-19,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Papa’s Pizza & Subs,"Papa's has been pulling me towards it for months now. Last Thursday, Mom had a craving for pizza so I suggested we try out Papa's Pizza & Subs. Located in Greystone Village, it's got tons of parking and sits between the bustling Gonza Tacos y Tequila and the new Bottle Revolution 3.Papa's has a more extensive menu than I anticipated! They have pizza, subs, pastas, salads, ice cream, calzones, and more. It's traditional and it's gourmet Italian food. They've put a lot of attention to the design of their menu. The back of the paper lists all the specials and has some coupons. Mom and I opted to get the 12"" Medium Pepperoni Supreme pizza. Triple Pepperoni, Double Mozzarella, and Cheddar Cheese. I just asked them to add Italian sausage to half the pizza and then we were set. We placed our order and the wait wasn't too long for the pizza to come up.The people behind the counter were friendly, attentive, and thorough. We got settled at a picnic table just outside since the weather was so nice. Mom gobbled down half the pizza. I paced myself and really enjoyed the flavor of every bite. I EVEN.ate.the.CRUST. I never eat the crust. This is definitely more Italian pizza than NY slices. It seemed family owned too. They even said to us, ""Let us know what you think."" I think I'm a fan!"
2015-05-19,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tacos Y Mariscos Vallarta,Food is tasty. I don't think it is super authentic like Los Cuates. The girls are very friendly and they have great drink specials!!
2015-05-19,2.0,"Cary, NC",NOFO At the Pig,"This was our first time here. Came in and loved the homey yet modern feel. Our server was great. Friendly and knowledgeable. We started with Caesar salads with obviously homemade dressing. Delicious. My wife had the Trout and I had Shrimp and Grits. Both dishes were hot, fresh, and absolutely delicious. Bottom line here is FRESH FRESH FRESH and made with great skill and care. If you have to crawl to get here your effort will be rewarded."
2015-05-19,5.0,"Wake Forest, NC",42nd Street Oyster Bar & Seafood Grill,Terrible salad.  Goat cheese strawberry pecan salad with raspberry dressing¼ of lettuce was wiltedOnly  1/2 a strawberry!Almost no goat cheese.   Included a slice of lemon (WTFIWT?)Eat anyplace at the airport but here for lunch.  Cheaper and better places to go.
2015-05-20,5.0,"Virginia Beach, VA",Anvil’s Cheesesteaks,Great people that are super friendly. The Cheesesteak was just alright. It wasn't bad but it wasn't anything to write home about either. I will continue to frequent this establishment though due to how friendly everyone is. I'd rather spend my money at a place like that than a place where people are rude or don't go out of their way to be kind.
2015-05-20,5.0,"Virginia Beach, VA",Backyard Bistro,"Great food. Great people. Their parking lot is kind of a gag if it's full. Otherwise, it's a great place to grab a drink and watch your favorite team play."
2015-05-21,3.0,"Sylva, NC",Thai House,No good :( the pad thai is not good all all. And the sauce that came with the summer rolls literally taste like licorice.
2015-05-21,3.0,"Troy, MI",Assaggio’s,Was good. Those jumbo shrimps were huge. Oh man. Pretty good price with 2 sides. Gotthe shrimp fra diavolvo ($18). That dessert was $3.50. First time trying it. Was good. But I'm not much of a cream cheese person. Too much for me. Too much sauce in the shrimp fra diavolvo but thats just me. Maybe some people prefer a ton of sauce. Friendly waiter and host. Clean place. Was new to Raleigh and haven't had Italian in a long time. Pretty good salad with 1000 island sauce.. Interesting.
2015-05-21,5.0,"High Point, NC",Clockwork,"As soon as you walk up to the door, you can tell that Clockwork draws inspiration from Anthony Burgess's classic novel ""A Clockwork Orange"" from the 70s furniture to the funky futuristic wallpaper. Cocktail drinks were delicious and unique, however I wish at least one signature drink with milk or something like ""The Moloko Plus."" Love the spot, love the drinks, love the food!!"
2015-05-22,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Taza Grill,"Fantastic food! Fast, fresh. The owners and the staff are incredibly nice and you're welcomed like family. The cucumber sauce is off the charts! Lamb is done perfectly. Fry seasoning is on point! A hidden gem with a nice outside seating area. Highly recommended."
2015-05-22,3.0,"Smithfield, NC",Donatos Raleigh,Bad delivery experience. First of all I ordered a 2 liter drink and also paid extra for ranch to go along with my pizza. I had my pizza delivered to my hotel and not only did they FORGET to bring my drink and my ranch but the pizza was burnt. You could not even tell it was a cheese pizza because the entire surface was black. I'm going to post a picture up here as well......

2015-05-22,5.0,"Fuquay-Varina, NC",Pearl Chinese Restaurant,"This place is ok. We had never been to it so we decided to give it a shot. It has a good atmosphere. Aquarium, a live turtle tank, house plants and a television.  They have a decent sized menu and the staff is very friendly.  However the food wasn't as good as other Chinese restaurants I have eaten at in the area. Would I come back? Yes, but it will be one of the last places I suggest."
2015-05-23,5.0,"Cibolo, TX",Flights Restaurant & Lounge,All the food was very delicious!  Was made aware of this gem via Groupon.  If you dont try this place with that extra bonus. you are missing out.  Kudos to the Chef!
2015-05-23,5.0,"Knightdale, NC",El Tapatio Mexican Restaurant,"My family has been coming here for years, and the very first time we didn't really love it, but we gave it another chance and everything was great, I think as the years go by the food just gets better and better.    I bring my family and friends here when they come from out of town to visit and everyone loves it!"
2015-05-23,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tacos Y Mariscos Vallarta,My favorite Mexican restaurant! My husband swears by the shrimp cocktail and I love the steak.
2015-05-23,5.0,"Philadelphia, PA",Taza Grill,"There are a few Mediterranean places like this one that basically compete on very few things such as food quality, speed of service and authenticity.Taza wins on all of these fronts, not to mention the warm welcome newcomers and old friends will receive from Sam as he loads heaps of delicious hummus on your Lamb Platter (my favorite).The decor is simple, but thoughtful. Decorated with pictures of Lebanon and authentic music to match, this place is fantastic and worth a try for fast casual lunch."
2015-05-23,5.0,"Carrboro, NC",ORO Restaurant & Lounge,"We had attended an event at ORO once previously so we decided to try it out for dinner last weekend, before going to see the NC Symphony. We live almost an hour away so we budgeted an hour and a half to eat and walk to Memorial Auditorium. We were seated upstairs and it was almost ten minutes before a server spoke to us. We ordered drinks and that took 10 minutes to deliver to the table. We wanted to ask questions about the menu but it was 30 minutes from the time we sat down until the server came to take our order. In the end, we sat there for an hour and a half. In that time, we had a small glass of wine each and we only shared a couple of appetizers. We never got the chance to have entrees or even second drinks. Finally, we had to leave but out server was unavailable to check us out. We walked downstairs and asked for our check. We explained why we were leaving. They still charged us for the wine and appetizers. We didn't ask for anything. We paid and left. This was the worst dining experience we have had in some time. We went to the symphony hungry and later had to find late night food to eat because we never had dinner. I don't see us returning."

2015-05-23,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mura,"I have ordered twice from Mura. Once was to go and the second time I dined in. I wasn't really impressed with their sushi but the calamari was wonderful. The service was also great both times. I'm mainly giving three stars because of the sushi, but the atmosphere is great for big groups and it is in a great location. I would give it another try for something else on the menu."
2015-05-23,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mura,"Service was nice but the food was sub par. Since when does tepanyaki come with boring under done steamed vegetables and burned broccoli? we also ordered the bento box with filet mignon. The steak arrived nearly raw. The seaweed salad was coated in mayo. The wasabi relish was off putting. The sushi was fine. The tempura arrived cold. The shrimp firecracker was inedible, with a mystery mush that I later was told included scallops, shrimp and cream cheese. The fried rice was served under my raw filet, mushy, tepid, and tasted like garlic flavoring not authentic fried rice. The Manager tried to make things right which we appreciate but with such positive reviews I expected a more positive food quality experience. Meh."
2015-05-23,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kabab and Curry,"Kabab and curry is a winner!  The food is fantastic and atmosphere is really nice for a college area restaurant.  Although it's not a perfect science, I tend to grade most Indian restaurants on the quality of their ""Butter Chicken"" dish.  This is usually the most popular dish at most Indian restaurants.  Overall, these guys made their version of the Butter Chicken very well!For the spice lovers, Kabab and Curry can kick it up a notch.  With a scale from 1 to 10, I went with an 8...which was perfect!  Spicy enough but still able to absorb all the other succulent flavors of the dishes.  Go try it out!"
2015-05-24,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Frank’s Pizza & Italian Restaurant,"Ate there while in high school just down the road. Still going 35 years later. Best pizza in Raleigh!! The location has aged around it, so you will not be impressed with that, but once you're inside it's old school retro Italian."

2015-05-24,5.0,"Port St. Lucie, FL",Mura,They had a great selection of sushi and vegan items on thw menu here. There is a veggie rattatouie and some neat veggie rolls.

This was a Tuesday night so deff not busy!! Then the salad comes out just a pile of spinach on a plate, she forgot dressing, didnt come back for another 10 min dressing was olive oil and actual vinegar u had to pour on separately. Then meals came out they were again not correct and forgot my sons meal and then forgot his mashed potatoes which we never got. The chicken was dry could barely cut had sent back and yet again dry and could not eat. They put my meal and my sons mashed potatoes on bill expecting us 2 pay for something we never got and then had the audacity to give us a scratch ticket to try and get money off next meal. REALLY!!!

I always order Lobster Ravioli and or Shrimp Alfredo Pasta. Today is Monday, I ordered the same meal (LobsterRav) Friday and received two completely different meals. Todays rav is hard, dry and unappetizing. I have to use a knife to cut them open so I can eat them. Usually I can use the side of my fork. When I opened the lid, all I saw was white, not a seasoning in site. I dumped some garlic powder and Mrs. Dash on it to try to stomach it.  I dont know if I will even finish this meal, I really dont want it. I'm so upset. This is my favorite restaurant. I don't even mind the 1 hour wait times even though I'm right next door. The food has always been worth it. Until today. I spoke with a manager and they've iffered me $5 off my next order.... I'm just not sure there will be a next order.Crisis Handled: Called and complained again. Manager remade my order and gave me a free slice of cheesecake. Thank you, sir. This remake is perfect."

2015-05-25,5.0,"Miami, FL",State of Beer,What can I say the numerous good reviews haven't the service is too notch and really friendly. They were delightful and really helpful trying to navigate the hundreds of beers. I tried the ghost pepper salami sandwich and it was so good. Spicy and savory without attacking your taste buds and numbing them.  The cheese plate and humus are large enough for a party of 5-6  if you don't want feel like a bite  there is plenty of beer for all .

Everything about it is charming. It is well decorated. They were playing some of the coolest music ever - a crazy eclectic mix of standards covered in foreign languages - think ""Hey, Jude"" in Portuguese.My waiter was efficient and extremely friendly - very interested in how I liked the food, how I discovered the place, etc. (Did I mention I found it through Yelp?).So how was the food - wonderful!  I'm posting photo of my wild salmon and fried rice - WILD, people! And probably the best fried rice I've ever had.(Funny thing about the menu - it's half-Asian and half American diner.)Good, good stuff in an unexpected place!  Thanks, Yelp!"

When you walk on the dining area is clean as a whistle and the kitchen is beautifully exposed. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwiches with French fries and I was impressed with non existent grease on the food. That is one of my favorite things about this place. I highly recommend this place to all. UPDATE: Corporate in Tampa contacted me about this review and thanked me for taking the time to leave a review and for saying good things about my experience. This really impressed me. Keep it up PDQ!"
2015-05-26,3.0,"San Francisco, CA",Pearl Chinese Restaurant,The food was average. We got crab Rangoon which were decent. I got Singapore rice noodle and it had no flavor. My boyfriend got general tsos chicken and the fried rice also had no flavor. The chicken was OK. The staff was friendly and a lot of space inside to eat. We sat outside which I enjoyed dinner the weather was nice.
2015-05-26,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bonefish Grill,"Took my Mom (and my wife) here for Mothers day.  The food and service were excellent.  I do not eat fish, and had a chicken dish - I was greatly appreciative that the chicken did not taste like fish (which often happens at seafood-centric restaurants) and was an excellent dish overall."
2015-05-26,4.0,"Knightdale, NC",Kabab and Curry,"Our normal Indian spot is quite a drive, but Kabab and Curry is so close and convenient. The restaurant seems clean, and the ambiance is nice but casual. You get crispy Papad and onion relish while you're waiting for your food to arrive, and it was quite good. The Chicken 65 is spectacular! Very garlicky and juicy...such a nice flavour! We would come back again and again just for that dish. The Mango Lassi and Masala Tea were also very nice. The Chicken MoMos are also very good. We had them in the MoMo soup, but unfortunately the soup itself was a bit bland. Next time we will just order the MoMo appetizer. The Mulligatwani Soup and Garlic Naan were also very good. The Naan was extra buttery and flaky. The Kashmiri Rogan Josh was also very good...the lamb chunks were tender and flavourful. The cuts of meat were nice and lean...no chewy fat in the dish at all. The Chicken Balti was also a pleaser, with a distinct flavor that must have come from the Afghani influence mentioned in the menu. We finished off with dessert, the Badami Kheer. It was cool and sweet, but also quite bland. Other versions we've had came with spices and shaved almonds, but this once just tasted like rice and condensed milk. Very basic and boring. One thing I must mention is that every dish was over salted. They even over salted the rice. Maybe this was an off day, but if you watch your sodium intake or just don't like a lot of salt like me, you may want to skip this place. All-in-all, it was a very good meal, and we will definitely be back."

2015-05-27,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kadhai The Indian Wok,"Some of the best Indian I've had in a long time, though I'll admit I eat it infrequently. Atmosphere was inviting and staff was very friendly. A little pricier than I'd hoped to spend that evening ($13-$18 entrees), but the portions were huge and delicious. Would highly recommend the Tandoori Chicken Masala special if it's available. Only four stars because the service was a bit slow - my girlfriend and I were the only two people there for an early dinner at 6 p.m. and noticed sizable waits between appearances of our server."
2015-05-27,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mami Nora’s,"I finally got to try Mami Noras!  This place is a little far from where I live. However, my husband and I were so tired of the same old options for a ""healthy meal,"" I was finally able to convince him to make the drive. I'm wishing I had reread the yelp reviews first b/c I was unaware that you get sauces w/ your meal, and now I feel like I missed out on that aspect. Oh well, another reason for me to come back!I ordered the quarter dark w/ rice & beans and tostones. I was afraid that I wouldn't get any of the raved-about flavor since I had to remove the skin for diet purposes, but the chicken was still very flavorful and smoky. I love rice, so the rice and beans were a huge hit for me. The only thing I wasn't that crazy over, were the tostones- not a whole lot of flavor there and pretty dry. And I hate to sound like a snob, but we stopped in during a slow time and not one table was clean. There was someone sweeping the floor, but they never bothered to clean the tables. Ehhhh. Anyway, the food was great. We'll definitely be back when we're on this side of town."
2015-05-27,3.0,"Durham, NC",Ole Time Barbecue,"I'm always on the hunt for some great BBQ and went to check this place out per a coworker's emphatic recommendation.  I was also promised that this place was the real deal and was basically in a trailer park.  I didn't take that part literally but to my surprise it was on the edge of a trailer park and I did take that as a good sign and got even more excited about the place (as opposed to my normal visceral fear of the unknown I usually experience when approaching a trailer park...but that's neither here nor there).   Anyway the restaurant is in a very cozy building, love how it looked inside and out, especially all the things up on the walls.  The atmosphere is very casual and there really isn't much seating but I really liked it and enjoyed the personalities of the staff.  I would actually give the food 3.5 stars but this place is just so cool I had to give it 4 (my local BBQ heartthrob is still Backyard BBQ Pit in Durham though).  This place does have excellent pork BBQ though and the food is a steal,  way better than a lot of places that charge a lot more.  You are served with delicious hush puppies right after your seated and my food came out about as quick after I ordered.  I had the Pulled Pork and Fried Chicken Combo with baked beans and Cole slaw cause this is the quintessential BBQ meal to me,  and I also just wanted some fried chicken.  Everything was good and it was a huge meal,  the pork was done right,  the fried chicken was crispy, the sides were standard (in a good way, tasty and traditional) and I even liked their house BBQ sauces.  I enjoyed myself here, the food just didn't go above and beyond for me, but this place is absolutely a solid BBQ spot and I would definitely recommend it."
2015-05-28,1.0,"Chicago, IL",42nd Street Oyster Bar & Seafood Grill,"Things I liked:Food was good and seemed freshHealthy choices with lots of steamed or grilled seafoodThings that I did not like:Very crowded Seemed understaffed. The person to my right and left had to rush. They had different servers who I saw working hard, so it seemed like a staffing issue.You have to commit to a half dozen oysters. Since I travel alone, I like just 2 or 3.Overall good food. A little pricey even for the airport but I'll come back for sure."
2015-05-29,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Poppyseed Market,"We love Poppyseed. They always deliver good food. We order from them a lot and often get sandwich trays and salad and chips. Everyone loves their food at the office so we get it a lot. When we go at lunch time it's usually pretty crowded because their food is so good. The only thing I'd ask them is to offer more salad options, like a special daily salad or just more than grilled chicken on greens. A lot of people would like salad entrees and they just don't really offer much."
2015-05-29,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bonefish Grill,I'm a big anti chain girl but bonefish was always an exception... Until now.   Ugh. I felt like I was eating at Applebee's- everything was just below mediocre.  They changed the bang bang shrimp somehow... I'm sure to save money... And it's not nearly as good as it used to be.  The potstickers were mushy and bland.  The corn chowder had a weird chemical taste.  The lobster roll also used to be sooooooo much better now its bland and weird.  The brownie dessert was grainy and odd tasting.  I guess this is yet another chain I won't be returning to.  The two stars are for the service and only the service which was excellent.
2015-05-29,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Imperial Garden Chinese Restaurant,"My wife and two sons and my grandson and I had Sunday brunch buffet here last week and we loved it. The food, ambience, and the service is superb, and they are very baby friendly too. My grandson made sure there was plenty to pick up off the floor when we left, but they treated us like gold and got a good tip accordingly."
2015-05-30,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Los Cuates,"I stand corrected.We went back a second time, again for the carne asada fries, and tried a chicken taco salad. Wow!!! Whole different experience! The carne asada meat was consistent with our first visit- well-seasoned, tender, and plentiful. The chicken reigns king, now, however!!!! Amazingly seasoned, to the point where we were both scraping around on the plate looking for the last morsels!! The taco salad itself was also very tasty and fresh. Maybe the best one we have ever had. I personally love that they don't put rice in it: just beans, meat, lettuce, cheese, sour cream and pico de gallo all inside that divine fried taco bowl.Seriously, I take back my two stars!! Even the service was much better and very friendly this time. Based on this, we couldn't help but wonder why there was only one other table there this evening. Prime time on a Saturday night!? So....Go there, now!!! You won't regret it!!!"
2015-05-30,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Moonlight Pizza Company,"As a Groupon junkie, I love to try new places. I'd give Moonlight Pizza a ""perfectly acceptable"". We ordered calamari, which looked good and the fried part was delicious. The calamari itself was chewy like a fistful of rubber bands. The pizza we got was a Greenhouse something or other, on paper it sounded incredible. The crust, great. They put lemon zest on it,  which seemed like it would be good but instead it was weird. The service was really good,  which is my biggest factor in whether I'd try a restaurant a 2nd time. That being said, it was so-so, but I'll probably go again"

2015-05-30,4.0,"Haleiwa, HI",Vivace,"Don't do it. Just don't. One word to sum this place up: bland. Started with a heaping serving of muscles that barely tasted the part. Their meatballs were mediocre at best, salad was full of lettuce that shouldn't be served in a restaurant charging what they do and the main course of pasta in a bolognese sauce that failed to impress. Then came the cherry on top... The bill."
2015-05-30,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",J Betski’s,"I like everything about this place. It was comfortable in an old world way, the service was excellent as was the food. I had the Fresh Kielbasa Sauerkraut with Spicy Mustard and the soup of the day which was a chilled creamy asparagus. The Kielbasa was perfect. It was dense but still very tender and full of flavor. The sauerkraut was just sour enough, definitely not sweetened. The spicy mustard added all the heat one could want. The soup was exactly as you would expect chilled creamy asparagus soup to be: delicious and refreshing. I asked for a beer reco and even that was spot-on!"
2015-05-31,5.0,"Coral Springs, FL",Los Cuates,"Really?!?  I don't know what all the raving is about.  Per Yelp reviews, I got the carne asada burrito.  It was...ok.  Certainly nothing deserving the praise from other reviewers.  The guacamole was disgustingly watery.  The salsa was just ok.  The atmosphere is non-existent.  It was just a sad experience."

2015-05-31,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Salt & Lime Cabo Grill,"After reading some of the other reviews, we decided to try this little gem.  This place is a great take on modern Tex-Mex.  We tried both the Chile Braised Pork and the Braised Short Rib Tacos (based on others reviews), and both were very good.  I was a bit reluctant about the Pork with the adobo sauce, as the sauce in many restaurants can be overwhelming, but I was grateful to find the adobo flavor was very mild and seemed to be only used during the slow cooking process.  As many others have suggested, the short rib tacos are hard to beat.For dessert we tried the Tres Leches Cake with toasted coconut, tequila apples & cinnamon ice cream.  Although it was not your traditional Tres Leches, it was nevertheless very good; but I'd call it more of a cake with some toppings.  We also tried the Molten Cake with blackberry sauce & chocolate ice cream.  The Molten Cake with the sauce was excellent, but the chocolate ice cream seemed more of an unnecessary after thought.I would definitely recommend trying this place if you are up for a refreshing spin on Tex-Mex. We will definitely be back for a repeat of these dish and to try something new."
2015-05-31,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Vinos Finos Tapas and Wine Bar,"This is one of my favorite spots in North Raleigh.   First, I really enjoy the atmosphere, which is cozy and friendly, never pretentious.  The service is always great, the owners and the staff are knowledgable, and the food is just fantastic. While there this past weekend, we enjoyed a really nice bottle of Valpolicella Ripasso wine -- wonderful from the minute it was opened -- and several small plates and a Salmon dish. We also had the tiramisu, and if you are a fan, it is a must have and worth every calorie.  I highly recommend Vinos Finos for a fun evening with friends or a relaxing date night."
2015-05-31,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kadhai The Indian Wok,"The lamb/chicken pasanda is INSANELY good.  We order this dish for takeout at least twice a month and crave it in between.  Can't even explain how immensely flavorful and tasty this dish is.  I hate to admit that we haven't really tried much else on the menu (when you find something perfect, why try anything else?) but their mango lassi is also delicious.  I hope Kadhai sticks around for a long time because it is a staple in our household!"

2015-06-01,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Cariokos Rotisserie Chicken,"I love Peruvian rotisserie chicken and this one did not disappoint! It's a cute little restaurant with friendly staff. The rotisserie chicken was seasoned and cooked to perfection and the yucca fries and blacks beans were wonderful. I'll be going back soon to try the chicken stir fry they also offer. This was a great choice over the typical fast food chicken usually eaten at lunch. The sweet tea was not our normal southern sweet tea, more lemony sweet than anything else which I don't prefer. Next time I'll go with soda."
2015-06-01,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Guasaca,"I've always been curious about this place so finally I got the $10 for $5 deal on Groupon and ventured over.  I'm a little directionally challenged so I did have to loop around the shopping center a few times before I found the place.  I got there right at 11 AM as they opened for lunch.  The place was empty so I got to take my time when ordering.  Based on all the positive reviews, I ordered the tilapia arepa and the shredded pork arepa.  The total came out to be a little over $8. First, I have to say I completely misjudged the size of the arepas.  They looks so small so I ordered two thinking I would devour them like appetizers.  Completely wrong! I was stuffed after one arepa! It was so amazingly delicious that I continued to pig out and ate until I was bloated.  The tilapia was definitely my favorite.  I was so surprised at how well flavored it was!  In fact, I don't think I've ever had tilapia as well flavored as it was here.  I'm super picky about my more ethnic cuisine options but I loved everything about my arepas.  The sweet plantains added the perfect balance of flavor to the savoy taste of the tilapia.  The shredded pork was delicious with the cilantro sauce as well.  By the time we left around 12:30, the place was packed!  The line was out the door, so if you're in a hurry, make sure to come earlier! The only negative I can think of is that there are a ton of flies to guard your food against if you choose to eat outside. In fact, I accidentally ate a fly, but the food was so delicious, I didn't scream or flip out but just calmly focused on my arepa."
2015-06-01,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Midtown Grille,Went there for my second time on Friday. Good food (slightly overpriced imo but good) and great wine selection. My husband ordered the steak frites and I got the salmon. Would return again.  Service was fine.
2015-06-01,1.0,"Apex, NC",Anvil’s Cheesesteaks,"I'm ruined. I can't eat a cheesesteak anywhere else now. I have been wanting to try this place for quite awhile but whenever I hit this shopping center I have a hard time resisting Barry's Café. My family decided to give Anvil's a try this last Saturday. I ordered the supreme steak, my wife got the mushroom steak and the kids split a grilled cheese. All of the sandwiches were fantastic and I have to admit I liked the mushroom sandwich the best. The sandwiches all had great flavor and the bread is amazing. Almost exactly the same type of bread you get in Philadelphia at cheesesteak places. That's why I gave this five stars. You won't find a better philly cheesesteak in the triangle area. The service is great as well. The menu isn't much but it doesn't have to be. The place is all about cheesesteak style sandwiches and they do it well. Why mess up a good thing?"

2015-06-02,5.0,"Louisville, KY",Salt & Lime Cabo Grill,"Salt & Lime has quickly become one of my favorite places for an awesome meal and amazing drinks in the Triangle! My husband and I came here for the second time last week and had a great experience.Since the weather was gorgeous, we got to enjoy dinner on the outdoor patio. I started off with a margarita on the rocks. One of my favorite things about S&L is that their cocktails are fresh and made with REAL ingredients. I hate the overwhelming sweetness of an artificial margarita -- S&L's cocktails are the real deal.You get free chips & guac with a Yelp check-in. The chips, guac and salsa are all amazing, just the right amount of kick. For dinner, I had the Island Shrimp Tacos. They were surprisingly spicy but delicious!Both times we've visited, the service has been kind of slow, but IMO the food and drinks make up for it.You probably won't find the place unless you're looking for it, but I'm telling you, it's awesome -- this was such a great find (thanks to my fellow Yelpers)! If you're not in a big rush and looking for an awesome meal, check out Salt & Lime."

She showed me my pizza - the supreme - & I couldn't wait to get it home! I ordered a small & I already knew it was going to be enough for three meals for me. Once home, I devoured about three slices. While the toppings were piled on - YUM! - the crust was thin - my favorite! The sauce was light. Plenty of choices in pizza & sub/sandwiches. Prices are very reasonable. Parking is limited."

2015-06-02,4.0,"Niceville, FL",Backyard Bistro,"My husband and I were visiting the area. We always ask the locals where to go so when the first two people recommend this place we had to go. It does have a sports bar atmosphere  and at first the prices seemed high to us but we decided to give it a try anyway.  Glad we did! We were extremely impressed with the food and service. I had the weekly special Shrimp BLT on a croissant and the Basil soup.  My husband had the Backyard Pork sandwich with the Cole slaw on it,  which was $2 off today, and the Basil soup also.  We both kept saying  ""wow"" as we ate. Both of us loved the flavoring.  Kudos to the chef!! We also split an Angry Orchid Cider beer for two reasons,  we'd never heard of it before  and it was only $2... We loved it.. And I don't drink beer. Though we were full after the soup and sandwiches we just couldn't pass up the Fried Moonpie with ice cream..... OMG... just fabulous!! AND for all that our bill total was $27. We highly recommend this place. Also a big thank you to Julianna for her patients in answering all our questions. Her service was perfect,  right on time, very helpful, never invasive, and she was very pleasant. Very enjoyable lunch."

Not much to say about this; it's as simple as it sounds. It is literally 3 different types of cheeses in between 2 slices of multigrain bread. The cheese tastes awful. Don't order this. However, I will say that the grill marks look fantastic!Grown Up Mac & Cheese - Unlike your typical yellow cheddar mac and cheese, this mac and cheese is covered in a white cream with slow-roasted short rib, red and green bell peppers, caramelized onions, and topped with a few sprinkles of cheddar cheese for $8. It's a little too soggy, and I could do without the bell peppers, but overall, it tastes good!Vegetable Quesadilla - This quesadilla tastes great! It includes roasted farmer's market vegetables (including spinach and mushroom), cheddar, salsa, and cajun sour cream for $7. Of the 3 dishes I sampled, I'd recommend this one!"

Well, look no further because Pearl satisfies those needs for those in the NC State area.I've had a couple of their dishes, and they definitely hit the spot. But there is a dish that I continuously order: Shanghai Chao Nian Gao. It is a delectable rice cake dish, stir fried to savory goodness with a meat and vegetable medley. Other Yelpers have raved about the dish, but I cannot stress it any further. You gotta try this out.Their great food along with their awesome-priced lunch specials garners a strong 3-star rating for Pearl. Disregard the awkward environment, cause the food is worth it."
2015-06-03,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tacos Y Mariscos Vallarta,Don't go here! I walked in on a Wednesday afternoon at 4 pm and even though the restaurant was practically empty I was seated in the back corner of another room like a leper. The salsa was terrible and like eating a bowl of ketchup. I had to add hot sauce to it so it at least had some flavor. The margaritas are good but that's about it. I ordered beef nachos but substituted carnitas and the pork was chunky with tons of greasy fat. The waitress disappeared for most of my dining experience and tried charging me double the price just to substitute pork instead of beef. I ordered take out from here before and thought I would give it another try....that was a mistake. Go to El Dorado instead. I would have if they weren't closed.
2015-06-03,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tenko Japan,I got the hibachi chicken entree and the chicken was pretty dry but ok flavor. The 4 star review however is because of the rice and vegetables. They were so flavorful and delicious and the fried rice was the best I've had from a cheap hibachi place. The price is great and the white sauce containers are huge so I don't mind paying the extra .35 to have 2 because that's all I really need (and I use a lot of white sauce). Will go back for sure! Just might try the steak or shrimp next time.
2015-06-03,5.0,"Durham, NC",Kabab and Curry,"Kabab and Curry is a fantastic authentic Indian restaurant that is really affordable.  My partner and I have dined in as well as gotten take-out from here.  We loved their chicken 65 and chilli chicken.   Their soups were also excellent!  We've tried 3 curries so far-- Rogan Josh, Balti (an Afghani curry), and Madras.  All of them were well prepared with generous portions of meat, although they were slightly oversalted.  We were also puzzled as to why there was quite a bit of salt in the Basmati rice.  This didn't really detract that much from our dining experience, though.  Their garlic naan is especially nice.  The best dish we've tried from Kabab and Curry has to be their lamb biryani.  It was perfect, and we were impressed by the amount of moist, juicy, lean chunks of lamb we got in our biryani!  The quality is definitely on par with our favourite Indian places in Cary and Morrisville, so this was a pleasant surprise for us.  We'll definitely be dining here again."

Firstly the place is a bit dumpy, but that was ok since somtimes the dump places are the best. The gluten free spring rolls are raw salad wrapped in rice paper and the gluten free pad thai with tofu was slimey and over powered with ginger. My wife couldn't eat it because it was so bad. When we sent it back they didn't want to take it off the bill. Then they offered 70 percent off. I had to tell them no, she didnt eat 30 percent of it, take it off before they would refund it.

I'd have taken a picture but I devoured it too quickly.Stopped here with my sister and my dog for some hang out time. Don't know why I haven't been here before the patio is perfect for the dog. Fully covered so she doesn't get too hot. Waitress brought out some water and she was a happy pup. I got the turkey burger and the tots. Burger was fantastic, tots weren't  bad either. I like them a bit more crunchy but that's just a personal preference. They definitely were not the greasy soggy grossness they can be at other places. Server was friendly and not overbearing. Overall this is a great burger place and we'll definitely be back!"

Looked up restaurants in the area, saw the reviews, took a chance and it was great. We had grilled chicken refried rice, a salad with shrimp and a champagne salmon dish. All were better than expected and better than they had to be! The place is eclectic and has a welcoming atmosphere. I'll be back."
2015-06-09,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Borough,"Breaks my heart to go from a 5star to 2star review (the ""signature"" drinks are the only saving grace now), but our last experience here was an absolute joke.Here with 3 other friends Sunday night.  Just ordering rounds of drinks until we decide it's food time.  My sister orders first; French dip add mushrooms.  Takes over 30minutes for basic sandwich to come out and the shrooms weren't on it.  Server apologizes, admits my bad, brings her a new, correct one within 4minutes.  In the time it took her food to come out, the other 3 of us order our food.The owner, Liz (slender, short, brown curly hair) was helping the server out, asking if anyone needed anything, etc, so we order through her.  Ask if I can do one of the mock chicken sandwiches but with real chicken and she hesitates and then suggests a different sandwich w actual chicken, that I didn't want because it didn't have cheese or the same sauce.  Asking that simple question was apparently a hassle, and I was made to feel like I was inconveniencing them so I picked a quesadilla off the app menu and she suggested the quesadilla that they had as a weekend special, I was just like ok, perfect whatever.The special was supposed to have onions and peppers in it and came out with neither.  Obviously let our server know and he brought out a side of grilled onions and peppers for me, and said that she (I'm assuming the manager/owner? as she was the only other person around who wasn't Bartending)  wanted me to know the onions and peppers were mixed in w the steak.  No.  They weren't.  Not at all.  There were none in the quesadilla and there certainly weren't any somehow stuffed into the tiny steak medallions.  Whatever.  My tab even said ""weekend special $7.50"" soooo...Considering this was the second thing wrong with our order, and that the food took a ridiculous amount of time to come out when the restaurant was slow, I expected her to acknowledge us more, or at least not throw her server under the bus, and have him be the messenger of BS news.  He doesn't make the food.  We had already spent a collective $75 on booze, so you'd think they might exercise a little bit more of respect or sincerity towards their customers.Long story short, the service has never been great, nor the food but for the price, you just take it as it is.  Only drinks here from now on."

We had no problem grabbing a table for four, though we loved that we could book a reservation through OpenTable. We ordered a few entrees to share, including the white pizza, beef ravioli and the chicken caesar salad. The 4-cheese pizza was phenomenal, the crust was fresh and brie added a nice kick to the 'za. The beef ravioli was ok, but the chicken caesar salad was crisp and delicious. I can't wait to come back again soon to try some of the different pizzas!"
2015-06-09,3.0,"Knightdale, NC",Tarbouch,"Maybe I came at the wrong time of day, but this place was not good. I ordered online over an hour before closing, and was told the meal would be ready in 30-40 minutes. I arrived exactly 30 minutes later and the place was a ghost town. My food was sitting on the counter, and when I got back to my car, I realized it was completely cold. The fries were soggy, the lamb skewers were very tiny and very dry and chewy, and the rice had a funny, stale taste. I wasn't given any napkins or utensils to eat with. The guy who gave me my food was not particularly friendly either (wish I could get back the $2.00 tip I paid online). I imagine my order came in and was ready within a few minutes, and just sat there to get cold. You would think if the website states a 30 minute minimum wait time, and they are especially slow, they would wait a few minutes to put the food in so it would still be hot when the person arrives to pick it up. I will say, the baklava and tzatziki are especially good, but that's not enough to bring me back to this place again."
2015-06-09,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Margaux’s Restaurant,"By far one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had.  We went on a Monday evening for the price fixe menu and had reservations.  We were seated promptly and our waiter asked for our drink order.  We weren't given a wine menu so he returned with one and it was about fifteen minutes later than he came back to take our order.  We ordered drinks and dinner at the same time.  Our appetizers came out promptly.  Unfortunately it was another hour and ten minutes before our entrees arrived.  Many tables around us that arrived after us received their meals first.  I told the waiter that I realize this probably wasn't his fault but that I would like to speak to a manager.  The portions were small, my order of scallops consisted of three.  My husbands medium rare steak was very overcooked.  He has never sent back a meal before, but did this time after the waiter told him to ""cut into the middle, it might be medium rare there.""  I again asked to speak to the manager and was told that ""some people don't understand that fine dining takes time.""  I said I would agree if the tables around us had not received their meals first.  He said ""different meals take different times.""  The table beside us had scallops as well and as I said previously, my husbands steak was overcooked.  We asked for the check and our desserts to go.  The manager never came over and we got tired of waiting for desserts and left.  This was my fourth time dining here and it will be my last."
2015-06-09,4.0,"Apex, NC",Chow Pizza Bar,"I went here with my Burger group on June 8, 2015.  I took a poll of the group and based on very subjective criteria I scored them in several different categories on a scale of 1 to 10.BUN:  7.2BEEF:  7.5CHEESE:  7.6EXTRAS:  6.9AMBIANCE:  7.7ACCURACY:  7.6SPEED:  6.0VALUE:  9.2OVERALL SCORE:  7.4if I equate the 7.4/10 score to the 5 star rating it becomes 3.7 Stars.This is a solid burger place.  They have a few options on burgers, and they have a great beer selection.  When you look through the individual scores, you can see the group dinged them on the fact their burger options were limited compared to many places we've been.  They only have 4 different burger options after you remove the turkey and black bean burger.  I thought what they had was good, but clearly the group subtracted some there.  Additionally it seemed to take a long time to both get our food, and when we were done to get our checks.  I think there were multiple factors that played into this, including some folks in our party arriving late and a waitress who confessed to this being her first night.  I would want to come back a couple more times before I pass judgement on their speed.   Lastly you can see they over-achieved on the value measure.  They have a Monday night deal that is any burger + a craft beer for $10.  It doesn't get much better than that!"

It is a quick serve place similar to Panera, where you order at the counter and they deliver your food. The location is convenient as well and helps to avoid the traffic. It's on the side with the Harris Teeter right next to Chuy's.I was very impressed with the food - I got a quinoa and Kale bowl, which was delicious! Our group only got the Southwestern one, but the others looked good as well. If you're looking for more protein, I suggest adding meat to it as it's vegetarian but extremely filling. If you go with the Southwest one, just know it is very spicy!Other people in the group got burgers, which looked very good. The fries are amazing!! My other favorite part about this were the drink options. They have Mexican colas and multiple varieties of teas and lemonades. Next time, I'll have to try the shakes since I missed out this time."

I got the sampler which included a bratwurst with mustard, a perogi with BBQ sauce on it, and some type of slaw (I think sauerkraut). It was excellent and exactly what I was looking for. I recommend getting the organic pilsner. It was refreshing and had a great flavor. For desert I had caramel ice cream in pastry cups with a chunk of toffee. Toffee was also crumbled in some type of cream drizzled around the plate. I loved the dessert! I was tempted to get the torte since so many others raved about it. Great ambience and friendly people. If I'm back in Raleigh, I will return!"

2015-06-12,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tarbouch,"Food: 3Service: 4Ambience: 3Date/Time: 6/12/2015 7:30pmThis Mediterranean place was a simple sit down restaurant with both indoor and outdoor seating and is next door to Harmony Farms on Creedmoor Road.  It compares closely to Greek Fiesta in that you order at the counter and sit down to wait for them to prepare it. Although Tarbouch has more variety on the menu, the taste of the food at Greek Fiesta, in my opinion, is better. The Chicken Sheesh Taouk platter comes with 2 chicken kabobs (4 pieces each) over basmati rice, along with 2 sides. The grape leaves are very good and the hummus is on the bland side but tasty. The special was Ginger Chicken over basmati rice which was good and somewhat spicy. Service was quick and the folks were very helpful and responsive with questions. The indoor seating was all laminated benches and tables along with metal cushioned chairs. Just a warning...the chairs have a metal back that hits the bottom of your back so sit forward or eat fast :-)Overall I'd recommend trying it to see how you like the food as it *is* good and fresh."

Not the usual suspects you'd find at every other bar. The bottle selection also leans towards stuff you can't find at just any old bottle shop. They have bottles of kombucha, etc. available as well as a couple wines by the glass for the gluten sensitive/non-beer folks.The folks working there have all been friendly. They also get some extra points for the music selection. Want to expand your beer knowledge? They even have a few books you can purchase!If you want something a little nicer than your typical bottle shop or neighborhood bar with a good selection, check out State of Beer.Mrs. B falls in the gluten sensitive category so not the beer drinker in the family and even she suggested going here one Friday night.

2015-06-13,3.0,"Cary, NC",Piola,"Let me start by saying that I love the pizza at Piola. I also love the profiteroles and let me get this out while I am on a roll...I used to go to Piola in Chapel Hill regularly and am very familiar with their awesome pizza selection, fresh and funky decor, and what Piola is really supposed to be. Sadly the Chapel Hill location no longer remains and NH is the only one in the Raleigh area. This has been my second visit to the North Hills location and my qualms are more around the operations and lack of service. We went to eat on a Saturday night before going to see a movie at North Hills. There was a concert going on a Midtown Park so there was no parking anywhere and we ended up walking from the Lassiter Mill side. No biggie and we worked up an appetite for pizza.The restaurant was empty and the hostess seated us a the table right in front of the door to the patio. It was the worst seat in he house because every time a server went outside to check on the patio, the 90 degree hot air blew in and knocked over the napkins and menus. The restaurant has such cute and colorful decor and many other places to sit yet we got stuck in the breezeway. Our server was not enthusiastic, never introduced herself and did not bring us bread nor tell us about any specials. I had to find out about the specials while in the bathroom where the daily specials are listed on the wall. Tuesdays look like a good day to come back because the drafts are only $3. The pizza is made right there and you can see the chef throwing up the dough and putting the pizza in the fiery flames.  The pizza is very delicious with all kinds of fresh toppings and thin, flame kissed crust. While the chef is busy making his creations, the servers stand around and chit-chat and check their phones. If I could give Piola a score based on the food alone, it would be a 4.5."

A large group like ours can be harder to handle however our waitress, Mary Clare, was excellent.   We couldn't believe the size of the portions of each course.  The  quality of the food was superb. My tuna was the best I have ever had. What a great experience !  If I had any concern at all it would be that even at our 6:30 reservation Nofo had only 3 of the chef's seafood plate of the evening left. If you are a seafood lover you might want to reserve it in advance."

Seafood is fresh and tasty. Gotta get the potatoes as a side. Service has always been solid. Great bar too.Only once in the dozens of times that we've been here has there been an issue with anything. The management went above and beyond the call of duty to make it right.

It wasn't amazing, but it was good and a great price, plus the service was solid.The watermelon gazpacho was my favorite part. It was surprisingly spicy but had refreshing chunks of watermelon and cucumber in it.My burger was... Eh. Fine. The julienned fries were cold and overcooked, like they had been sitting out. The house salad was pretty standard looking, and the taco salad was delicious.I wouldn't say this would be my first or even my fifth choice for lunch on Fayetteville Street, but if you happen to be passing by, it's an okay option."

I was really excited but it didn't meet my expectations (I think I'm picky). I would give this place 3.5-3.75 stars if I could.It was SO cold when we first sat down, they were blasting the AC, it was a bit ridiculous but eventually I think someone complained and it was turned down. I ordered the Garden Fresh Veggie Scramble and it was pretty good, but it was just overwhelming. There was a lot more veggies then eggs and it wasn't super flavorful. I think I should have gone with something off the griddle. I really enjoyed the biscuits and the apple butter, it is a nice touch to everything, I wish you were given more then just one. It seems like with the word biscuit in the name there would be more different flavors or getting a basket of biscuits for the table. Also, the menu was difficult to read with the logo on the back of it. It was covering a lot of the words, making it hard read over it. I would say they need to change that to make it easier to read. There is a ton of seating and the decor is very fun and inviting. My friends will recommend this place over and over, I am happy that I got to visit, but I think I would try another place if I am ever in the area."

The thai basil recipe has changed and tasted like soy sauce from a frozen meal. $59 down the drain. I am so shocked at how badly it has declined that I really don't know what else to write.

2015-06-17,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",ORO Restaurant & Lounge,"When you walk into this place it does not feel like you are in Raleigh. The decor is very modern and everything is white in color. It reminds me of Miami. It is the perfect place for a group of people because it is kind of tapas style but the dishes are not that small. All the drinks are super yummy but my favorite that I have tried is the white sangria. I have tried several dishes here and I have not been disappointed. They have plenty of vegetarian options as well. My favors is the miso corn! I really enjoyed the mushroom risotto, truffle mac and cheese, ribs and scallops. The desserts were probably my least favorite out of all the dishes we got. However, I did enjoy the smore's dessert which was basically a deconstructed smore that you used a candle to charr the marshmallow. The service was great and every time I have gone, I have had a good time."
2015-06-17,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",MoJoe’s Burger Joint,"I decided to go here after it showed up in a Google search for good veggie burgers in Raleigh. This place was near the top of the list, but I'd have to disagree with that.There was a $1.80 extra fee to switch the beef patty to a veggie burger. I have never seen this before. Usually, if places offer to switch a meat burger to a veggie burger, there's not usually a fee. I would think that the meat is more expensive than the veggie patty (however, I didn't ask what their veggie patties are made of, so that's an uniformed opinion). This being said, it's great that they offer the option to switch to a veggie patty with all their signature burgers instead of just having the one simple veggie burger option. I definitely appreciated that.The burger doesn't come with any sides, which I also thought was a little unusual, but not unheard of. You can add fries for $1.50, but if you're on a budget these extra charges add up (they also charge you for a side of ranch!). As for taste, my veggie burger was good, but it didn't seem like anything outrageously special.Big side note: The meat burgers might be fantastic, but I don't know. My whole review is based on a veggie burger!"

I appreciate State of Beer not only for its wide variety of beers on tap, but because of the expansive selection in coolers and on shelves. Have a question about a beer? Want to try a flight or sample? The friendly bartenders are always open to discuss beer, brewing, and even how to advertise -your- own homebrew with you. Their menu selection ranges from cheese plates, to salads and delicious sandwiches. My favorite is the one with the ghost pepper; watch out. It is SPICE. The atmosphere is so lovely when they open the side door and its the middle of a spring rain storm or quiet summer sunset. Great outdoor seating and usually a record spinning some chill music in the background. They also have books about beer that you can browse, provided you don't spill any bev on them! I go running next door on Thursday nights and treat myself to a beer here after. Great place for a date, a friendly meet up, or if you want to drink by yourself but not feel by yourself. (Not that I encourage that kinda thing..) Anyway. State of Beer is wonderful."
2015-06-17,1.0,"Greensboro, NC",State Farmers Market Restaurant,Stopped in here with a friend on our way to the beach. Loved that it was right off I-40 so it was easy to stop but definitely a much more fun and interesting pit stop than fast food. The restaurant was really unique- decorated with a lot of North Carolina memorabilia. The food was awesome - love that they serve breakfast all day. And the service was awesome - very wholesome southern comfort vibe!

The atmosphere is nice and cozy, but not at all pretentious. Then there's the food... I don't know how it could have been any better. I'm sort of picky when it comes to sauce and REALLY enjoyed the veal parmesan. My girlfriend had the chicken piccata and loved it. The portions are generous too. We WILL be back."

I visited one in Boston years ago and am glad the chain has moved south! Stopped in for lunch and grabbed a spicy avocado and lime bowl, made with kale, sautéed vegetables, black beans, corn, grape tomato, queso fresco, cilantro, chipotle puree, all finished with a red pepper vinaigrette. It was seriously good, and that's from someone who knows that too much kale can be a little overwhelming. All of the ingredients just seemed to go really well together. It was a very large portion, so maybe keep that in mind. The burgers and accompaniments I saw also looked delicious; I'll be sure to check those out next time. The soda fountain also had healthier alternatives, which I really appreciated. Great job!"
2015-06-18,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",P.G. Werth’s,"Six of us had lunch today which was overall good. Our server Jorge was very friendly, upbeat and professional. The bar tending for cocktails needs some upgrading---needed to look-up a ""sidecar"" also ordered a Manhattan and Pino Grigio but we are a very forgiving group. We ordered sandwiches which were all good....chicken salad, ABLT, and Oh My Cristo all quite tasty with  Sides all good particularly sweet potato and noodles and great chips. Deserts were good-the cheesecake very good and the pecan pie but needs improvement with the crust.  The ambiance was very chic and modern. An overall good experience. We will be back."
2015-06-19,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Shish Kabob,"Sometimes you need a quick and easy meal that hits the spot. You may also want this meal to actually be healthy. Shish Kabob perfectly hits the trifecta of [reasonably] healthy, cheap, and fast. Prices, selections, and portion sizes are all very comparable to other Mediterranean houses. For sides, I have only tried their salad, and I was impressed. Their salads have a delightful amount of ingredients.I have no real complaints about this place. If you work nearby, Shish Kabob provides a very good lunch."
2015-06-19,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Manhattan Cafe,"Manhattan Cafe offers sandwiches, soups, and create-your-own pastas and salads. I am always in the mood for a great Manhattan-style sandwich. Now, you may wonder what comes on a Manhattan Club, since that is not one of the sandwiches that is on display. Well, wonder no more - ham, turkey, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. I decided to order that, chips, and a drink - $10.Their food came out in a reasonable enough time. I was immediately disappointed by the size of the sandwich. Bite into it, and am I overwhelmed by the burst of flavors? Nah. Ham, turkey, and bacon are all cheap ingredients. I'm not opposed to paying a lot for sandwiches. Heck, I even spent $20 for a sandwich that combined quality and portion size at Katz Deli. Alas, that was in the real Manhattan. The price is the only thing Manhattan about the Manhattan Club, as it didn't wow me in terms of portion size or quality.My favorite part of the meal was the chips. They carry very cool potato chips here that I've never seen before, and I enjoyed the chips immensely.I'm sure I'll be back to try the salads or pastas, but I'm defintiely not impressed by the sandwiches."

The appetizers (like I knew what they were) were great.Ambiance is cool, agriculture themed in the dining area we were in.  Service was attentive, making sure our waters were kept filled and inquiring for more drinks as our wine/beer showed itself as empty.Dessert was also worth writing about.  Tempura cheesecake - mmmmm!  Great dinner at a great value!  Looking forward to doing it again."
2015-06-21,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Thai House,"It was hard for me to decide between a three star and four star review for this place because thai house isn't consistent in their quality. When it's good, it's excellent. On some days though, the quality is significantly lower than what it is on the best days. It's better than a lot of Thai options in this area even on it's weaker days but that's not necessarily saying much.the panang curry is my go to dish and it tends to be good even on Thai House's less than stellar days. The curry is rich, complex and they will actually make it spicy (many places here skimp on the spice). I get it with tofu which also helps with the sometimes hit or miss nature of this place. Ordering meat dishes is a little bit more of a gamble. This isnt a huge issue for me when it comes to entrees because I actually prefer tofu with curry but one of my favorite thai appetizers (the num tok) has steak in it. Sometimes this appetizer is delicious, sometimes the meat is tough, poor quality and over cooked. I don't order it often now since I never know what I'm going to get.Similarly, service is hit or miss as well. The owners are very nice, friendly people so I feel bad saying that but it's true. There gave been times I've come here with a big group and still been served efficiently but there are times I've come by myself and had to wait around an excessively long time while the waitstaff chats. You just never know.Part of me feels like I should've gone with  4 stars because I actually am a regular here, despite my criticisms but inconsistent meat quality is kind of a big deal. Also, the last few times I went here weren't the best so sadly, it's possible that the decline in quality could continue though I certainly hope not.Basically, i do recommend you give this place a try, especially if you like vegetarian entrees but be careful about ordering meat dishes and don't go if you're in a hurry!"

2015-06-21,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",J Betski’s,This is one of the premier restaurants of Raleigh if you enjoy German/Polish food. Everything from the sauerkraut to the sausage to the gnocchi was made fresh in house. I could taste the quality in every bite.

2015-06-21,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kadhai The Indian Wok,"I would have given 4 stars out of 5 if the prices were better. We got takeout. The food was good and we did have leftovers, but I have had similar quality food at other Indian restaurants (in Cary - maybe because there is so much competition) for a better price. The sauces were distinctly different - good thing. More naan for the price would have been appreciated. I will probably go back as it is closest  to home but will need to feel I can splurge."
2015-06-21,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Vivace,"The food here is phenomenal. The only reason it doesn't get five stars is because the service did not match the quality of the food. The waitress might have been new or having an off night. Either scenario is completely understandable. It's a good thing the food more than made up for it. I will be back. Although, I hope to get better service."
2015-06-22,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bonefish Grill,"Had Sunday Brunch at the Six Forks Location. Both the food and the service were lacking. First the food. I ordered the Omelet Oscar. This omelet contains crab and asparagus. Mine omelet arrived in a pool watery butter with 5 or 6 very tiny morsels of crab (way less than an ounce totaL) drizzled on top of the omelet. There was NO CRAB in the omelet, and very little of the other ingredients. Service. We were promised bread, none was delivered to the table. We asked for a coffee refill, our server had another server bring us our bill instead, to avoid serving us a refill on coffee. The whole experience was very mediocre .. we will not be going back."

2015-06-22,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",NOFO At the Pig,"Went to NOFO for restaurant week. Hostess couldn't find our reservation and had an attitude. My party ordered from the appetizer/entree/dessert special menu. I got the beet and kale salad, prime rib with baked potato, and key lime dessert. The beet salad was lovely! Prime rib was a little fatty and chewy but the loaded potato was huge. Dessert seemed like an afterthought, not horrible... Satisfactory. Didn't get a chance to go to the store as it closed before we finished eating. Overall the meal was enjoyable but a potato and beets is not a dinner. Oh and the atmosphere, how could I possibly forget? The kitsch overwhelmed the restaurant... I get it, they converted it from a Piggly Wiggly supermarket... Can we focus on the food a little more and the decor a little less please?"

2015-06-25,3.0,"Charlotte, NC",MoJoe’s Burger Joint,"With my extensive addiction to burgers I just couldn't resist checking MoJoe's off my list. We were just stopping in for a quick bite so after a couple of seconds looking over the menu we decided to go with an Oreo milkshake, some jalapeño poppers, and of course... a Burger.The milkshake was delicious and probably had the highest Oreo to milkshake ratio ever attempted. There were so many Oreo's crushed up into the milkshake I thought for a second it was a chocolate milkshake. The jalapeño poppers were pretty damn awful unfortunately. For $1 a piece I was expecting these things to be laced with something pretty special. Instead what I got was crappy US Foods frozen jalapeño poppers.And now for the burger... I can't say anything bad about my burger. The grilled onions were good, the patty was cooked well, the toppings were all right, but as a whole there was nothing special about the burger at all. For being such a popular burger joint I was waiting for the moment of realization but it never came. I might be wrong but nothing about MoJoe's Burger Joint seemed like anything worth recommending. I'm guessing its a popular hotspot for late night drinking and not for good eating."
2015-06-25,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Person Street Pharmacy,"Yay loving this lunch spot in Oakwood. I walked in early afternoon this week after hearing a lot of buzz about the newly updated spot. Man this place was packed full of hungry lunch patrons, ranging from young professionals to families and retirees. I love the soda fountain type restaurant feel. There aren't a lot of tables in the place so get there early if you want to sit and eat. You order your food at the counter and they will call your name when it's ready. We ordered the BBQ sandwich and the special kale salad. Everything they make in house and is super fresh. They definitely have some hurdles to work through with getting the food out, but hey they are new and the place was really busy. One bite of that BBQ sandwich and you will be glad you waited I only had a bite but it was really good. The kale salad was awesome and I would definitely order it again I hope they keep it on the menu. You have to order a soda I believe they make them with local Crude Bitters & Sodas. We ordered the cream soda and pomegranate soda so good and I never drink soda but these were the real deal not sugar filled grossness. I saw a lot of people eating the footlong hot dog and BLT so I can't wait to get back and try them out. These folks are putting out some good food it's definitely worth checking out."
2015-06-25,5.0,"Clinton, NC",Backyard Bistro,Terrible service -- long story short (as my original review somehow got dumped) food is run of the mill american -didn't get served for 10 minutes after someone stumbles upon us - took 20 minutes to get ketchup which was only after I had to ask another waitress - 10 minute wait on another beer and check was wrong. Not that great service bad.
2015-06-25,4.0,"Apex, NC",Hayes Barton Café & Dessertery,My wife and I went here for our Anniversary. The place is cozy and decorated like a hipster style 50's diner. I really like it. We started with the iceberg wedge salad which was great then had some of the specials on the menu. My wife went with the almond crusted cod which she devoured. I had the fried chicken with calabash on whipped potatoes. Pretty much the best fried chicken I've ever had. But you don't go to Hayes for the entrees it's all about the deserts at this place. Towering 18inch cakes are what you see when you first walk in and you will want one. I ordered the cookie dough cake and my wife got the brownie batter cake. Even though we are married we both wanted to turn the lights down low put on some mood music and have a intimate moment with our desserts. They were so good and totally worth 5 stars by themselves. The service at this place is great and we will definitely be back again. What I would suggest is going with 4 people so you can make a reservation before hand and guarantee you have a seat. The place gets crowded quickly and can really only hold about 20-25 people at one time.

2015-06-26,4.0,"Durham, NC",Zoës Kitchen,"The people were friendly and the place was pretty crowded at lunch time, but the food was just okay.  My salad consisted of a bunch of greens but not many vegetables or toppings.  The dressing on the table just tasted like oil even after it was shaken which added no flavor to the greens.  My pimento cheese was a glob of cheese on bread.  Even though I asked for the sandwich to be grilled, it ended up just being greasy rather than warm.  Pita bread was served with all our meals, but there was no hummus.  There should be a hummus side option in addition to the appetizer.  I'm sure people would order it as a side.  Overall, I was not amazed by my experience here despite all the recommendations and would probably not come here again."

I am never disappointed and always satisfied. I usually check reviews prior to going to a restaurant, but as with anything, it's better to base your opinion from your own experience."
2015-06-26,5.0,"Durham, NC",Shaba Shabu,"While the ambiance, decor, and service are great, the food, unfortunately, does not even come close.My table ordered the eel roll, bagel roll, and 3 lunch specials (Pad Woonsen Chicken).  I knew the sushi was going to taste awful right when I saw it.  It was discolored and the fish didn't look fresh at all.  It tasted like it had been taken out of a plastic bag and de-thawed.  There was nothing fresh at all about it.  The sushi was super chewy and did not sit well in my stomach.  The ginger was good but who can really mess up cut ginger.The Pad Woonsen Chicken had no color to it except for the raw carrot thrown on the side.  and had absolutely no flavor.  I had to douse my whole dish in Siracha for it to have any flavor or spice.  Usually thai restaurants have their own sauces, but this one did not. I could have cooked something at home and used the same amount of Siracha to make it taste the same.  The dish was not even warm when it was served.  I was basically eat cold noodles and rice that did not have any flavor.I will never come back to this restaurant and eat lousy food again."
2015-06-26,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Wakefield Tavern,The nachos are AMAZING.  Everything else was just OK. The fries ...they should be kind of ashamed of themselves they we just awful. Pizza has a weird taste to the sauce.  Burger was OK. Not the best but not the worst I've ever had.But by far the worst thing ...my god in heaven WHY does the busboy have to constantly be strolling around the room with his hands behind his back????  It was so incredibly annoying and distracting.
2015-06-26,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Black Cat Cafe,"Tucked away behind the Bonefish Grill and a few other bigger businesses, it's an easy place to miss. I was in the area and decided to drop in for a quick breakfast.The server was kind of monotone throughout and didn't express much emotion, but seemed like a nice enough girl. I opted for the shrimp and grits with cajun spices, with a few adjustments. It was delicious! I was a little concerned with the portion size at first, but it wound up being just right. For dessert, I wanted to try something I didn't see too often so I got the jasmine rice pudding. It was alright, the rice was too firm and nothing really stood out. Next time, I'll pick a different finish. Maybe tiramisu or the peanut butter pie. Haven't had it for any other meal, but would recommend this place for breakfast or brunch."

2015-06-27,5.0,"Morrisville, NC",Clockwork,"We'd heard about Clockwork as an awesome cocktail bar, but got super excited when we looked at their food menu shortly after they went on OpenTable. We definitely didn't need our reservation at 6 on a Saturday, as we were the only people not at the bar (maybe 3 other people just getting drinks). Maybe it was because of this, but the service was fantastic. They recommended Last Tango in Paris as a sweeter cocktail and they came through- delicious! We got a number of small plates, starting with homemade cheese with honey and pita points, which was cold, but very good. The Spinach Salad was excellent, as was the Pimento Cheese Sandwich (with fries, of course). The Fried Cheese balls were just okay, but overall, we were not disappointed in the least!The only semi-off thing we could find was the prices we were charged were just slightly different than the prices on the menu (just a few cents here and there, but still odd...)."
2015-06-27,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mami Nora’s,I decided to grab take out from here since I've been hearing so much about this place and read several reviews on yelp about the food. The restaurant is located near a few auto dealerships but it was easy to find with its bright exterior colors and bright signs. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the drab interior however that doesn't bother me since the best food sometimes comes from places that aren't super nice inside. I ordered the two piece chicken white with black beans and rice with a side of plantains. It was very busy so there was a wait and I should've called my order in advance.The food was extremely delicious and the chicken was so moist and tender. The other items were cooked to perfection as well. The entire meal was priced reasonably and I will get take out from here again.

2015-06-28,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Flights Restaurant & Lounge,"Flights is located in the Renaissance Hotel at North Hills, a sprawling shopping center that spans several city blocks. The venue is upscale and pleasant, with modern decor and a comfortable atmosphere. Valet parking is free to guests and diners at either of the hotel restaurants. Staff members are friendly and welcoming, if not the most experienced or often available. The restaurant was nearly empty on the weeknight we ventured in, but our drinks went quite some time without any refills and were lukewarm with little or no ice. The menu looked impressive in its culinary sensibilities and flavor profiles, suggesting that the dishes were designed by a chef who knew what they were doing. Unfortunately the execution of almost every single dish had very serious flaws. For the price, those flaws were unforgivable. The bison short ribs was a $30 plate of tough, glutinous mashed potatoes and dry, fibrous meat that tasted primarily of raw alcohol from the marinade. I've had better pot roast on a Golden Corral buffet. The portion was tiny, if attractively plated, and absolutely dreadful.A ham and pea risotto was well executed, but the peas were wrinkled and bitter. I suspect they were freezer burned. Picking out the off tasting peas helped, but for the cost of the dish it was not forgivable that they were using poor ingredients.The sweet potato custard that was served with the scallop dish sounded quite promising. The subtle, restrained sweetness of this root vegetable can definitely work with seared scallops. Unfortunately, there was nothing subtle or restrained about the sweetness in this supposedly savory side dish. It tasted like Bill Cosby should be shaking his fist over it while wearing a particularly ugly sweater.  Also the custard was broken and had set improperly with an odd texture. The fried chicken was well cooked - for $17 it had better be - but everything else had very serious sourcing or execution errors. Can not recommend.."
2015-06-28,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Babylon Restaurant,"Gorgeous venue! Here for #RFWF ..Raleigh Food and Wine Festival. For its first year, I think the organizers could not have picked a more scenic place. The event was held both inside, upstairs, downstairs and guests had access to the beautiful courtyard/patio. Think Moroccan, Mediterranean decor and be ready for an other wordy experience when you walk thru the door. The outside bar offered a misting spray if you wanted to cool off while having a cool drink. The bartenders had great attitudes and even custom made drinks for a group of ladies. The overall atmosphere and vibe of this place was great. I will definitely like to return for dinner. I recommend it highly for events!"

We grabbed 2 seats at the bar so we could watch the Australia v Japan Women's World Cup game. I like the little red sound boxes that are lined up at the bar (downside: not all of them work), you can choose a TV and listen to the game. We split the Backyard Sampler, I liked the boneless wings and sliders but was not a fan of the flavor of the ribs. We also split a few side items: mixed vegetables, stone ground grits (a little bland), butter beans and mashed potato gratin (my favorite). The location is convenient especially if you are going to an event at the PNC arena."

2015-06-29,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Person Street Pharmacy,"I drive, walk, run, bike by this pharmacy all the time... little did I know the blue awning-ed drug shop on Person Street, aka Person Street Pharmacy, sold one of the most delicious barbecue sandwhiches I've ever tasted. The bbq was a little sweet but it was like a sour sweet, not a tangy kind. Perfectly matched with a heavy bun, somewhat resembling the consistancy of a pretzel doe but not quite as doey. Their creme sodas stirred fresh and mixed per order brought me back to the good 'Ole days I lived through black and white televisions series, when the cola bar was the happening place. Far from old school however, I see this cafe becoming one of my favorite lunchtime stops!"
2015-06-29,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Midtown Grille,"My friend and I each started off with one of the seasonal cocktails--neither was good, but mine was especially poorly made (very overboard on the vermouth). The bread was ok and the butter was great--last time we had a lime butter, and this time it was lemon (honey?). It was awesome. It took 55 min for our entrees to arrive (our only order outside of the cocktails). The waiter told us that the kitchen had been hit by a rush when we came in, but the restaurant was at less than half capacity the entire time. The grouper was perfectly cooked and the veggies under it were delicious--the only complaint here would be a small lack of seasoning for the sauce. My friend got the ""duck a few ways"".  The confit was great, but the breast was truly rare--the fat was not fully rendered and you had to bite through the fat. I'm all for small plates, but it was very pricey for the quality and portion of the food."
2015-06-29,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Imperial Garden Chinese Restaurant,"This place is just okay. I've never really been impressed with the food here. However, they are incredibly fast so that's the one good thing. I came here the other day and ordered the shrimp lo mein. When I got home, I opened it to start chowing down. But it literally smelled like garbage. I don't know why I thought it would perhaps taste better than it smelled because it didn't. It even tasted like garbage. I don't know if they used bad meat or what but I had to toss the entire thing in the garbage (where it rightfully belonged based on it's smell). I didn't bother taking it back since I was already home. I probably won't try this place again."
2015-06-29,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Black Cat Cafe,"So, it was Sunday and we were looking for a fun new place to get some brunch. We were away from the Pam's and farmers market restaurant and were closer to North Hills. Before I start, just go to Pam's or the farmers market for brunch and skip this place. Just run the extra few minutes and go to those yummy houses of food happiness. I gave this 2 stars because the name of the place is cute and there is outdoor seating. We were sat outside because we asked and it was gorgeous out. I had no predispositions and had no clue what the menu would be like. Their menu has so many stipulations. My bestie usually gets a. Club for brunch, but you can only order it on weekdays? Whatever. Fine. We ordered sodas and asked for a few minutes. I ordered the classic French toast with eggs and bacon. My bestie got some sort of monster sandwich with rosemary-garlic fries. I will say that someone ordered a pizza and it smelled amazing! Anyway, our food came and I will say that they have great presentation! That food was beautiful and probably Twitter/Instagram worthy if I took that many pictures of food. I do sometimes for yelp, but I forgot because I was starving. I could smell my besties fries from 2 feet away and I'm sorry, but it's gross when you're trying to eat French toast and all you can smell is garlic and heavy herbs. I pushed passed. The eggs were lightly warm and a full on solid when I got them, the bacon was cooked well, but next level greasy. There was a damn coating o'grease. I ate these things and got super excited for the French toast. It was adorable and powdered with sugar fairy goodness. It has amazing texture, but I got instant cavities. It tasted like candy. It was so sweet- overboard before I even put syrup on it. I do the pre and post syrup taste test. The syrup actually dulled the taste down a bit and was awful. There wasn't even a slight maple flavor. It was like molasses sugar water so it would be nice if the syrup was syrup and not whatever was in that cup. My friend stole my oranges from my fruit bowl because her breath was just rosemary and garlic. She also spent the rest of the day in the bathroom and that was all she had eaten so I don't know. This place seems to have really good reviews, but I was left wanting. It's a cute little place with a cute little name, but it was just very blah to me. I had one piece of the 4 pieces of French toast and I told the waitress that it was inedible and sweeter than most candies. She kind of laughed awkwardly and took our plates. The check was about $35 and we were starving by the time we got to dinner so we paid that much for eggs, bacon, a few fries and half of a sandwich. I feel a little bad, but the food was gross and the service just wasn't all that ."
2015-06-30,4.0,"Concord, NC",Hayes Barton Café & Dessertery,"Only stopped in here for dessert after dining somewhere else (similarly to quite a few others it seems), and I was pretty impressed with the Peanut Butter Brownie Cake. As others have said, each slice of cake is $9.50, but they are all VERY large. The cake we order consisted of a chocolate brownie cake with a peanut butter mousse style frosting and chocolate buttercream frosting on the very outside. The brownie-cake was amazing! Moist, fudgy, super delicious, and exactly what you would want in a ""brownie-cake"" hybrid. The peanut butter mousse was good and complemented the cake well but wasn't great. (Coming from a guy whose favorite food is peanut butter) Overall I would say this cake was really, really good, however, but the service and everything else at Hayes Barton wasn't positive in my experience here. The lady at the cake counter was rude to multiple people in front of us, including blowing off a girl who asked if they had a dessert menu and then finally stating after being asked a few more times that they did not have a menu that you just had to look at the cakes and see what you wanted. She did tell us all the cake flavors at least, but I was also disappointed that you cannot order just dessert and eat in the restaurant. If you want to dine in it has to be for dinner as well, otherwise you have to get your slice(s) of cake to go. Overall: awesome cake but I was somewhat suprised at the customer service (but maybe that was due to it being a busy Friday night?) I'll have to come back and try ordering dinner as well."
2015-06-30,5.0,"Knightdale, NC",Red Pepper Asian,"Well FIN-AL-LY! An Asian restaurant to brag about.  I went here on the review of Lori R. (waving emphatically..thank you Lori!) because every since I moved here from the NY/NJ area I have just not found an Asian fast food restaurant that I love.  Red Pepper Asian is  a very nice suprise because it doesn't look like much on the outside.  I do not go into this shopping center much because there is literally no store in there that I would frequent so for me, Red Pepper is is like hiding back in the cut but it is not what we used to call in my hood - a hole in the wall.   Once you walk in you are like...okay then peeps, I see you with the simple, yet quaint decor and the ambiance with the low lights and all. What??? Holla!  It felt like date night!  It is a very small spot but I like that a lot because sometimes you go to a restaurant and there are so many people and often it's loud between people talking and overhead music that I think these places forget you want to reeeeeeellllaaaxxxxx!  Me and Sgt Major Husband (yup i have one of those) can often feel like..dang, why didn't I just stay home and eat in peace.  So if you want relaxation and you want to turn down and not be turned up....check it out.Okay yeah what about the food right?  The food was great.  We had calimari which was a little different than what I was used too but it was great - crunchy which is important.  who don't like to crunch okay?  I had the triple delight...the portion was great but what impressed me..what the size of the shrimp.  It's been so long since i have seen a real jumbo shrimp...I was beginning to think they were going extinct or somenthing.  My husband said ""wow"" and trust me he that translates to, ""wow, honey that really looks good, I am going to grabbing a few of those off your plate.""  Sgt Major Husband had House Pan Fried Noodles which was also very good.  And the interesting thing about that is..he had shrimp on his plate too, but somehow eating some of mine made his dish taste better.  funny how that works.Oh and this is the ultimate cherry on top for me....The unsweetened ice tea with lemon.  Yesssssssssssssss hon-tey. I am an unsweet ice team snob.  It cannot have that bitter bite on the end of a sip and it just CANNOT be watered down.  There is an art to this here thing - trust me! How you gonna be cooking in the South and you can't make ice tea properly.  No stop bragging about your crap - learn to make tea, lemonade and Arnold Palmers and THEN...I am impressed.  Their tea was perfection!  So not sure where you are living your life in the Triangle, but I personally don't let distance stop me from a great dining experience so check this one out.  Guys...don't take your Golddigger to this joint okay..she won't appreciate it.  Better yet how about you just dump her altogether, keep your coin in your pocket and get you a nice girl who likes and adventure and who will go with you to the neighborhood joint.  We call that ""An around the way girl"".....but she digresses...as usual. Red Pepper Asian....that's what's up."

2015-07-01,2.0,"Cary, NC",Poppyseed Market,"I was so excited to eat here because my mom kept raving about the food, but when we went, I was not impressed. It took a while for us to get our food and during the wait they served us their complimentary Jalepeneo cornbread. This cord bread was topped with honey and did not taste good. It tasted like a biscuit and tamale combined into one. Once I got my quiche I was excited to eat it because it looked so good. But once I took a bite I regreted the decision. It was so oily and didn't have any flavor. So all I ended up eating was the side salad which was the only thing that actually tasted good."
2015-07-01,2.0,"Forest City, NC",Kadhai The Indian Wok,"Food was awful, Service was awful. Not even fill your water or ask you if you need anything else.Avoid this restaurant if you are looking for some good taste and good service."
2015-07-01,5.0,"Fort Belvoir, VA",Black Cat Cafe,"I was in Raleigh for a few days and stumbled across this beauty. It's a mom & pop place. Very friendly service and fast. I Had a Farm fresh salad with ""chicken-less"". Very fresh and light, great lunch spot.  They seem to have regulars and they have a good amount of outdoor seating."
2015-07-01,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Red Pepper Asian,I was passing by corporation drive and wanted to check out the mall for food. It's on the same side as the car wash on the opposite side of New Bern. The name was catchy something I'd think of and the front had Asian dishes placed. It's a nice place with modern decor and 10tables for 4pax. The lady came with the lunch menu and it was around more than 10pictures with description. I chose Thai Basil Chicken with a choice of beef. It came with soup or spring roll and the soup had choices which I chose Wanton and it was flavorful with 1 wanton it also was served with crispy appetizer. A choice of white or fried rice which I chose fried very tasty. The chicken just had enough heat to eventually make me sweat. The basil tasted fresh and just the right amount of sauce. Total with water and tip $9. Service is super fast. I'd come back to taste the others in the menu.
2015-07-02,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Frank’s Pizza & Italian Restaurant,"Finally I have made it to Frank's. The new menu has been condensed, but the food is pretty good. I had the spaghetti with chicken cutlet parmesan which came with two nice size pieces of chicken I also had the meat lasagna and both were pretty good."
2015-07-02,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",ORO Restaurant & Lounge,Chef Chris outdid himself. We had the chef's tasting and we were stuffed. But it was a Food Network/Anthony Bourdain kind of food experience. My place to go in Raleigh now. Best food I ever had. SO WORTH IT!!!!!
2015-07-02,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Players Retreat,"Four stars for the scotch and burger lover. Three stars for everyone else. Two stars for those who require a high level of service.I love the atmosphere and abundant outdoor seating at the Players Retreat. They have an AMAZING selection of scotch which allows you to sample $90 bottles before you buy the whole dang thing. Burger meat is ground in house and really really good. Be prepared to come here and wait, this place is perfect for you to enjoy the game patioside with some brews or drinks and take it easy. I return here time and time again, knowing and willing to flag down a server when I need something. I'd highly recommend the Pete and Hawaiian burgers and the 15 year old Solera scotch. The hawaiian burger is loaded with jalapenos for the perfect combo of spicy/sweet."
2015-07-02,5.0,"Wake Forest, NC",Wakefield Tavern,"Great food and consistently good service.  We love the burgers, Shrimp and Grits fish tacos and pizzas."
2015-07-02,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",b.good,"I was excited to try this place since it offered healthier options, but after lunch today I think they should change the name to b.gross. I ordered a turkey burger and fries. The turkey burger was a giant piece of dry meat. The fries were not that bad though. I immediately had a horrible stomach ache after eating and will NEVER go back. I also spent $11 on that crap.Also, I noticed some of the staff being rude to other customers."
2015-07-02,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bolt Bistro,"I've been to Bolt a few times now, so figured it was finally time for a review. This restaurant has been around for a few years now and replaced The Mint. It is a prime location on Fayetteville Street, which is perfect for those of us working downtown.My favorite thing on the menu has to be the mussels. We got it as an appetizer one night and I think it's my favorite thing on the menu. They are buttery and delicious; some of the best I've had in the states. At lunch I prefer to get the steak taco salad. This thing is HUGE. It comes with black beans, corn, tomatoes, salsa, guac, cheese and steak. I opt to remove the ranch (it's a zesty chipotle ranch) and just mix sourcream with the provided salsa and guac. It's really enough to feed two people, so I generally end up taking some home with me. I love that they are on OpenTable, and are always accommodating for large groups. They used to have outdoor seating, but with construction outside it has been limited for the time being."
2015-07-02,4.0,"Miami Beach, FL",The Flying Biscuit Café,"They had 6 or 7 open tables, yet we had to wait 25 minutes to be seated. Ended up getting a seat at the bar. Bartender said they were out of steak, and the wifi doesn't work. She was rude, and also had a cold. Stay home if you're sick, don't touch my food. The appetizer biscuits were too hard to eat.... How ironic the place is called flying biscuit. All in all the breakfast was a 3 out of 5. Food wasn't too bad, but definitely nothing exceptional. Don't recommend coming here, or anywhere in North Carolina for that matter."
2015-07-02,4.0,"Arlington, VA",State Farmers Market Restaurant,"Went for breakfast because of high reviews. Did not live up to expectations.Restaurant was nearly empty but service was very, very slow. Menu is large but surprisingly limited --- only breakfast offerings were eggs, meat, potatoes (where were previously frozen diced potato cubes that then had a too-long encounter with a deep fryer.)  No breakfast fish available, no coffee cake, etc.Biscuits were highly recommended by reviewers and on menu, so I ordered a biscuit, 2 eggs easy over, and potatoes. The biscuit came 20 minutes before the rest of the food. It was warm when it arrived, but it was spongy, not flakey.  Eggs were uninspired. Coffee was bitter and tasted vaguely of chicory. The waitstaff was very nice, but I had to wait to give order, to get food, and to get check. I was never offered a coffee refill.Avoid."
2015-07-02,3.0,"Charlotte, NC",Jimmy V’s Osteria & Bar,"Same ol' big hotel restaurant offering with a $15 medicore breakfast buffet for the ""all-u-can-shovel"" crowd.  Entrees can be ordered from the menu (my wife's omelet was delicious), but a cook station with a chef is preferred for an upscale restaraunt.  Bar closes early at night as Raleigh draws the curtain on their downtown scene around 2:00 p.m. (I guess they vacate downtown to beat the commuters back to the 'burbs).  Sleepy, sleeepy, sleeeepy vibe."
2015-07-02,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Taste Small Plates | Wine Bar,"Excellent first experience at this sweet neighborhood restaurant. We did make a reservation, and even though it was mid-week, the place was quite busy. We opted to sit on the patio - comfy and relaxing. Service was excellent - our server Jordan was jovial and accommodating. Cocktails - fresh, chilly and delicious! We ordered the Caprese salad, Ahi tuna and petit filet plates. We went with a seasonal berry bread pudding with roasted peaches for dessert. All were absolutely scrumptious. This place knows how to do good food. We spent the evening talking about when we will return! Great Raleigh find!"

The rolls are baked at the restaurant or the bakery next door, the owner shops daily at the farmers market for the salad greens, the tea is very fresh and flavorful, and the sausages are all mixed and made on site.In Raleigh visiting or if you live nearby like us, stop by!"

2015-07-03,5.0,"Chester Springs, PA",Imperial Garden Chinese Restaurant,"It has been nearly twenty years since I was at this restaurant. Food is still excellent but the service was veeerrryyyy slow. Our waitress would disappear for fifteen or twenty minutes at a time. I would give the food a four or five stars. The kitchen can't help how the servers handle the dining room. However, the service was so bad it may make me think twice about returning anytime soon. After the great food, I am sorry to have to give three stars."

2015-07-03,3.0,"Holly Springs, NC",State Farmers Market Restaurant,"This restaurant is a must when my father visits.  He loves a big ole' country breakfast.  Don't expect a flaky biscuit here - it's fluffy and soft - that's the way they are made.  There are no shrimp and grits here. . .you'll need to drive to Charleston for that.  What they DO have is breakfast meats that will put meat on your bones - country ham, sausage and pork tenderloin.  If you want to really have a country breakfast, order the egg, pork tenderloin and biscuit and gravy.  This place is not for everyone but it's great if you know where you are. =)"
2015-07-03,4.0,"Orlando, FL",State Farmers Market Restaurant,"There was a brief wait as it was very busy in the restaurant for lunch. They offer complementary biscuits and corn bread. The menu has a standard breakfast and standard fare.  They also have a special's menu with a variety of country offerings and sides. The service was fine, but it took a long time for our food to come out. After asking a couple of times it finally arrived. The chicken fried steak was tender with a peppery white sauce. Very delicious!  The mashed potatoes were average and the deviled eggs were tasty with a pickle relish."

We would be coming back, hopefully for dinner!"

It was very close to the highway (and a Starbucks), and the staff was quite helpful when I was having trouble ordering due to my frazzled and tired brain. The pizza slices were HUGE, too. I would definitely stop here again on our next road trip from Nashville to Nags Head. The bathroom was clean and private, too."
2015-07-05,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Backyard Bistro,"This is the ultimate sports restaurant. You'll think you're in a movie theater for sports. U-shaped booths sit on stepped tiers leading down to a giant wall of big screen televisions showing every sport in existence. Even if you hate sports, as I do, your jaw will drop at the huge television wall. My rating is based on the food, bumped up a star for the cool ambiance. The best thing I've eaten here is the s'mores dessert. The food is just OK, not great, but don't come here for the food. The service is good. The attraction is the sports theater ambiance."

If you're looking for breakfast, go to Harris Teeter, buy some eggs, and cook them at home. Or better yet, find a Harris Teeter with a breakfast bar, because it's actually excellent. Cash only. Come back at night when the parking lot gives way to an awesome dive bar."

2015-07-05,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Black Cat Cafe,"Such a good brunch spot! Our group was pretty indecisive and the server was helpful and very patient. Although the breakfast options looked pretty great, everyone got different salads. The Thai curry, Aegean, and the Farmer's Market salads all were done with such high quality ingredients. Greens and toppings were so fresh and seasonal. Outdoor seating is tucked in and feels separate from the N Hills parking area. I was really impressed. Service was also so pleasant and accommodating."

It made me feel embarrassed and it quickly changed the energy of my experience there.

2015-07-06,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",State of Beer,"The location is great and they do not have the distraction of the party crowds from Glenwood and Fayetteville street. They have a unique local and international beer selection and the prices are average. They offer interesting and tasty snacks, such as a cured meat and mustard plate or sandwiches, which I have not seen at other bottle shops. Another noticeable difference they have from the other nearby bottle shops is a lot of good seating inside and outside."

2015-07-07,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Vivace,"I am very picky when it comes to Italian cuisine and I was very impressed with my experience. The wait staff were all very polite and extremely knowledgeable. We had the Brussel sprouts, prosciutto San Danielle, and mussels to start. All fantastic. We followed with the arugula, kale, and beet salads. Again all phenomenal. We finished with the lamb shank, veal, and Bronzino. The veal being my favorite. Absolutely exquisite execution. The wine recommended by our server was perfectly paired with each of our dishes. This is hands down my favorite Italian restaurant in the Raleigh area. HIGHLY recommended! We will be back again very soon!!"
2015-07-07,4.0,"Morrisville, NC",Clockwork,"Went here randomly because c Grace (a block up and over) was closed. Never knew Clockwork was there!!!  Love the decor instantly. The music seemed to be controlled from the bartender's cell phone. And his taste in music is AWESOME!  Lots of songs you'd expect, given the mid-century/70's vibe of the place. I didn't catch his name before we left, but he was awesome. Great energy, music selections (he played House of the rising sun and hotel California and I was hooked on clockwork after that.), super knowledgeable on the bar, and mixed our drinks with finesse. The Bliss o Bliss was my fav drink!  It tastes like a vacation. He made mine with a little simple syrup and it was delicious. We also tried some of the food. TRY the Tri Me pizza. It sounds weird, but it's so good!  We tried the fried ravioli too- it was good, but I wouldn't get it again. Too many different textures going on at once for me."
2015-07-07,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",State of Beer,"I really enjoy State of Beer. I've come here for both drinks and food and have yet to be disappointed. Tucked away near the Exploris Middle School down on Hillsborough Street, this bottle shop stands out from all the others because they serve delicious food! Not just charcuterie and cheese plates (which are delicious too!) but full sandwiches. The bar area is long and beautifully done, with rotating taps and a large collection of records. I haven't gotten to sit outside yet - both times I've visited it has been raining! The seating inside is not huge so it can get crowded on a weekend night. The bottle selection is great, not as large as some other shop's, but I can certainly find something interesting to take home with me! I'll definitely be back to sit outside and enjoy a beer and a sandwich next time the temperature dips below 90 during the day!"
2015-07-07,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bolt Bistro,"So the wife loves this place. This would be my second time the first was for lunch and it was good.  This time we went for dinner, service was great food was very good. Only one bad thing it was Thursday night it was slow, but I even called for a reservation. I was looking for a nice night out with the wife no kids no unneeded noise and the host seat us across from a group of over 10 people and growing as we ate. Just a little common sense would have been nice."
2015-07-07,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bolt Bistro,"We stopped in during First Friday to grab some grub before bar hopping. We were drawn in by the menu on the outside but realized that was only for happy hour and no burgers were to be had.We were seated upstairs which was more upscale and best for a date night or maybe an early dinner, not for a group of 5 tipsy people. We didn't like the atmosphere upstairs, too stuffy and quiet, but the service was great and the food was pretty good. I hade the bolognese. Very good but needed a little salt. Hubby had the calamari which was possibly the best I've had in ages. Very fresh and light, not super bready or greasy. My sis had the lobster mac and cheese. No one was really impressed. The place is very nicely decorated and we will probably be back for happy hour or apps. I suggest sitting downstairs if you want to feel like you're a part of the action."

Everything - the bread, the meat, the cheese - was spot on. We will definitely be back."

2015-07-08,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Despina’s Cafe,Stopped in for a chicken salad sandwich the other day and was the best chicken salad I have had. I could tell the chicken was fresh and dressing was light and flavorful. Will definitely be back!
2015-07-08,5.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Shaba Shabu,Went here months ago with my boyfriend. It was a great place! Lots of options for lunch and dinner. The miso soup was awesome!! The interior decoration was they classy and very sleek looking I enjoyed it. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. I don't remember what I ordered all I remember was that it was really good and I definitely will/would go back if i'm in the area.

2015-07-09,5.0,"Holly Springs, NC",The Roast Grill,"I've been to the Roast Grill a few times.  It's good, not amazing, but you don't really come to a place like this for the food (although the baklava is the best I've ever had).  You come here for the experience!  And what an experience it is.  Make sure to set aside a decent chunk of time if you go here, because you might have to wait for a table, you might have to wait a while to get your food, and you might have to wait a while to pay the bill.  This is fast food without the fast.  Also, if you are germ phobic in the least, you might want to skip this place.   It definitely looks like it hasn't been cleaned in a very long time.  You can barely make out the lettering on the menu board as the formerly white letters are now covered in brown grease.  But honestly I would never go back to this place if it was all sanitary and white, with no character.  This place is full of character and is why it's been around since the 40s!"
2015-07-09,5.0,"Los Angeles, CA",Person Street Pharmacy,"The food was mighty good (chic salad sandwich on toasted awesome bread) unique soda flavors. I dig the throwback simple diner style but the customer service was lacking. The gal at register/drink maker/host was bickering with cook, talking to friends, eating at the bar, cursing. And the news crew is out front filming this new ""hot"" spot. Ugh no thanks, I don't want to feel uncomfortable while eating lunch at the bar..I didn't see a manager so I left. A little behavioral training goes a long way."

2015-07-09,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sosta Café,"This was an interesting place. We're not vegan but we were looking for a lunch place with lots of veggies. We ordered the piggy and a prosciutto sandwich. I have no idea what the Piggy was but it was pretty tasty, although the texture was kind of strange and I'd much rather eat a bbq sandwich. I thought the prosciutto sandwich was really good. They gave us tons of beans and lentils to the point I thought we might fly out of there. It all tasted fresh and delicious.The place was pretty busy and the owner seemed to do everything. He took orders, bussed tables, answered the phone, delivered food, moved tables around. We were half expecting him to break out a guitar and harmonica. Overall, we really enjoyed it. I think if I worked downtown I'd come here often for lunch."
2015-07-09,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Taste Small Plates | Wine Bar,"Ok. So here is my two time experience review. The food was just amazing both times. The chicken and waffles item was truly well balanced. Not too sweet. The tuna ..... Yummy. The belt line sliders ....... Delicious both times but a change in the seasoning. First time a little salty, the second time a little bland. Somewhere in the middle perhaps?  The service was great and the overall was amazing. Bring it on Mateo. Taste has it on all cylinders. Other than the seasoning of the sliders."
2015-07-10,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Aggie’s Grill Station,"This place just seems confused with what to serve so they try and serve a little bit of everything and therefore don't have a particular 'specialty' Aggie dish. Italian choices are all the same but just different meats (w/exception of lasagna). Not even sure shrimp should go with a meat sauce but to each their own...If you go, make sure their regular chef/cook is in or you'll get your dishes at different times. I got my dish and it was about 7 minutes before the next dish arrived. So yes, my food got cold waiting and was told it was because the current cook doesn't multitask more than one dish at a time...what a joke!Grill is in the name but not sure why...then again bourbon chicken really isn't an 'Asian' dish but is in the 'Asian' section.Maybe they'll find what makes them distinct before it's too late..."
2015-07-10,3.0,"Sayville, NY",Piola,"My experience here was ruined because the massive amount of smoke from an E-cig. This one was a very strong scent and I was unable to enjoy my dinner here. They have a nice patio outside and the waitress even told me that they were not even having any food, just drinking. I had asked the waitress if we could move or ask them kindly to step out because the Odor was very strong. She said no problem she would mention it and they continued to do it and obnoxiously as they drank more. So our entire bill was about 42 and I didn't enjoy the experience due to the overwhelming tobacco vapor.  In this situation the drinking customers were taken care of over the paying dinner customers. So one star for that. I will give credit when due, the manager did come over and apologize and said he would he looking into implementing a new policy to ban all tobacco products. I understand that the E-Cig is a new concept and some will have to take it as it goes, but to give an honest review...the strong smell did take away from experience from trying this place and as a paying first time customer... Our concerns should have been considered. Food is awesome, highly recommend. Cool atmosphere with great vibes. I'll definitely give them another try and rewrite this review.  Two stars for customer service and the manager personally speaking with me and the third star for the food. A yummy place and definitely could be a plate to split with a friend."
2015-07-10,3.0,"Asheville, NC",Zoës Kitchen,"The staff and the atmosphere of the restaurant are excellent. But the food is awful and not worth the price. It is very bland. The chicken is dry and the steak was slightly undercooked. The side of vegetables were burnt. The Greek salad dressing has no taste. When I informed the staff member of my concerns he listened and went to get a manager. I was not given a manager because the manager felt my concern was not good enough and inaccurate about the food quality. So the manager did not come out to speak with me about my concerns, he sent the staff member back to discuss my concerns. The manager told the staff member that I should put salt and pepper on the food if it was bland. Honestly if you are in the area I would not recommend this restaurant. If you are looking for good food there are many restaurants around it. One I would recommend is The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar."

I've been here twice.  The first time in April & 2 days ago when I was back in town to get some things ready at our new place.  The food here is amazing.  Every day there is a different drink special.  Another unbelievable thing that draws me here is the Manager Pablo used to work at one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in NEPA called La Tolteca. Small world we live in. Great place, this is going to be our regular place for Mexican food when we are in the area for good."
2015-07-10,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Pam’s Farm House,"I've been here a lot, but only eaten the breakfast.  Nothing fancy here, just solid southern breakfast.  The hot cakes are king here.  They are wide, thick, and tasty.  I try every single time, but I've NEVER been able to finish two of them.  As far as meat goes, I highly recommend the smoked sausage.  Overall, you can't really go wrong on food here. Service is great, waitresses really friendly, and you'll never run out of coffee!Bring your cash!"
2015-07-10,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",State Farmers Market Restaurant,"The State Farmer's Market restaurant was ordinary. It was busy but we were immediately seated and our waitress was nice and got to us in an orderly fashion. I wish she had explained or at least asked us if we had any questions regarding the menu since it is a rather extensive list. It includes a typical a la carte breakfast/lunch menu but also a Sunday special menu that includes your side of meat and two veggies. All very tasty and made fresh from what j could tell. Our table was given hush puppies and biscuits, and like others have mentioned, the biscuits are AMAZING. They were super tasty, they were fluffy and I could joyously feel my arteries clog with the amount of butter and/or margarine used to make them so soft. However, I was disappointed that the restaurant didn't use the opportunity to showcase the food in terms of their locality to North Carolina. Isn't the purpose of a state farmers market eating and buying local? For instance, the butter and jelly provided for my biscuits and hush outlines were the prepackaged assortment. The menu, while clearly promoting southern style cuisine, had sparse information as to where my veggies and meats came from. Although I do hope that someone will correct me and state that, indeed, the very tasty ingredients are NC grown and from local farmers.Nevertheless, this is a very lovely place for delicious southern food. There are substantial portions, so prepare to take a nap afterward."
2015-07-10,5.0,"Morrisville, NC",Chubby’s Tacos,"I got grilled tilapia, shrimp and chicken tacos. Only the grilled shrimp was good. The chips and salsa were pretty good too. The half pitcher margarita was mostly ice... Didn't get $'s worth"
2015-07-11,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tacos Y Mariscos Vallarta,"Finally able to eat after a month of a liquid diet due to surgeryNaturally I choose Mexican food due lol. First off. This place is open 24/7 on the weekend. Secondly. The food is so colorful.I ordered a beef chimichanga and chicken enchilada. Both were very flavorful and fillingFYI The chimichanga comes with the red sauce on it. The only reason why I got the enchilada was to try the sauce in the photo The meat is well seasoned and tender. The tortillas are yummy. I had both flour and corn. The beans are not bland. The rice was ok. I'm picky when it comes to my rice. My salad was flavorful. It had sour cream , Guac, and lettuce with onions and tomatoes. The chips were crisp and the salsa was fresh and flavorful. You can really taste the cilantro. All in all if I'm in the area I will definitely come back!"
2015-07-11,2.0,"Orlando, FL",Randy’s Pizza,"Randy's makes some pretty good NY style Pizza. I ordered one to go, veggie. Their sizing is one size up from what you expect. If you order medium, it is actually large to extra large. The Pizza was very well made. The crust was good, sauce was tasty, cheese was good, and the veggies were well done. The order was ready on time and the staff were pleasant. I would definitely come back."
2015-07-11,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mo-Te Vietnamese Restaurant,We make bahn mis at home so this was our first time buying the sandwiches. They were out of chicken so we had BBQ pork. Definitely a good size for the price we also got their egg rolls which my husband liked but to me tasted a bit like some seafood or seaweed was in there. We got our order to go but would come back again and eat in and order some drinks. The lady was nice and it was just a 10 minute wait for the food. I ended up just walking around outside and checking out nearby businesses
2015-07-11,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Flying Biscuit Café,They got the dopest pimento cheese sandwich I've ever had. Just the right amount of spice and it comes with bacon on it. They also have great biscuits which they serve with their own delicious cranberry apple butter. It is probably the best restaurant in the Cameron village area. That being said there's usually a wait. My only complaint food wise is that the mac and cheese isn't that good.
2015-07-11,5.0,"Santa Clara, CA",Taste Small Plates | Wine Bar,"Bruschetta, sliders and ahi tuna were all spot on. Service was good, and the chef came out and asked each table about their meals. Highly recommend this place."
2015-07-11,5.0,"Clayton, NC",Mandolin,All I can say is AWESOME!! Service is fantastic. Food was out of this world!! If it's your first time you've got to get the chicken and waffles with collard greens. BEST collard greens I've ever had!!I recommend making reservations. Especially Friday or Saturday nights. It gets busy and isn't a huge place. People dressed casual to quite dressy. Valet on Friday and Saturday nights as well. Enjoy!
2015-07-11,2.0,"Creedmoor, NC",BURGERFI,"I saw a lot of mixed reviews for this place, but I needed to meet a friend in the area, so we tried it. I thought it was pretty good. Between the four of us, we had a build your own burger, a cheeseburger, a hot dog, a veggie burger, an order of fries, and a order of onion rings. My burger was great, though any time I can put nacho cheese on something, I'm probably not going to complain--add bacon its a huge winner. Loved that the back of the bun was intact (not cut through) so I didn't lose any of my toppings--many of which are free!!! The hot dog was for a kid, so it was plain. The dog itself looked a little funny cuz it was split all the way down the middle, but maybe they do that on purpose so the toppings can get inside??? My friend said her burger was pretty good.The veggie burger also seemed to be good, but it was his first, so idk how important that opinion can be. The large fry order is definitely a shareable option. You can get one large order for the table. The onion rings are also massive. I have never seen anything like them. They're a little difficult as a table sharing item--because of their size. They would work out to about one each (I think there were 5??) but they are really good. Not very greasy, and nice and salty!! We all left very full--and I hadn't had a chance to eat breakfast that day!!It's a little if the pricey side, but other than that--give it a try!"
2015-07-12,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Casa Carbone Ristorante Italiano,"What I loved about this place, is that it is very Vegetarian friendly. You can choose most dishes and ask them to make it vegetarian. We started off with Lentil Soup (Zuppa Di Lenticchie) which was quite flavorful. For main course we had the Fettuccine Carbonara and  Manicotti without meat. The Carbonara was a little under seasoned however the Manicotti was delicious. Great service, will return again."
2015-07-12,4.0,"Los Angeles, CA",Moonlight Pizza Company,Pizza was excellent. Felt like legit Italian pizza with the thinner crust and simple recipe. Great vibe and service.
2015-07-12,5.0,"Morrisville, NC",Bolt Bistro,"Bolt has been a great addition to Fayetteville street: cool design and good food. This is a place you want to take people to impress, be it potential partners, date or parents. The menu has few, but carefully selected items sure to please any palate. I went with a large group and we chose two appetizers: seafood trio consisting of lobster, shrimp and tuna; and fried calamari. Both were tasty and tender. For dinner I ordered a jerk palella, which was decent, with lots of flavor and well prepared bits of seafood: fish, lobster, calamari and scallops. A few friends ordered steaks and were happy with their selections, although having a lot of trouble with inadequate steak knives. Those who got shrimp and grits were delighted and made me jealous of their choice.We had two birthday persons in our group and the server insisted that they order the complimentary dessert. And by the way, you get a free dessert with Yelp check in!We got a chocolate torte (rich and not overly sweet), a cheesecake (tender and classic New York Style) and the chocolate chip bread pudding. The whole table agreed the that last was the best and simply amazing. Crunchy crust, warm and soft inside, sitting in a puddle of sweet condensed milk, it was a real treat!Bolt is a bit pricey, yes, but you can count on good service, quality food and cool atmosphere."

2015-07-13,3.0,"San Jose, CA",MoJoe’s Burger Joint,"Stopped by here tonight for a late meal. I'd heard they do $3 burgers after 10PM on the weekdays, but I couldn't resist order The Vortex because I was intrigued by a burger that uses two grilled cheese sandwiches as the bun. The burger came out quick and was tasty, although I'm not sure what the default size is (6 oz?) and I would probably upgrade it to at least their 10 oz in the future. The ratio of bun to burger was off and I wound up wishing I had more beef. I really liked the atmosphere and vibe of this place. Indoor and outdoor seating was available and it was very lively, especially considering it was after 10PM on a Monday. Go here if you're looking for chill place to hang out and have a burger with friends."
2015-07-13,4.0,"Denver, CO",Tacos Y Mariscos Vallarta,"We came into the restaurant around 2:50, ten minutes before the lunch menu was over, so we were still able to get their amazingly low priced lunch options. The plates were huge; we actually thought that they gave us the dinner portions since we were cutting it pretty close to 3. I got the beef fajitas, which was really good. There were tons of meat, bell pepper, and onions, which I wasn't able to finish. And the flour tortillas were made right on site per order, so when I got them, they were still steaming hot in the container. My husband got the enchilada and chicken taco plate, which were also very good especially the chicken enchilada. I preferred the chicken enchilada because it had more flavor. The service was fast and the servers were also very sweet. They are also open around the clock on certain days which is also pretty awesome. I would totally recommend this place."
2015-07-13,2.0,"Durham, NC",Mo-Te Vietnamese Restaurant,"First visit, and while it was far from perfect, it was an okay experience.Excellent Banh Mi sandwich (they were out of chicken, so I opted for bbq pork). Okay Hot/Spicy Beef Noodle soup - broth was very-very oily, not particularly hot/spicy, but indeed tasty.  I think I need a bib, though.  This was hard to eat without a lot of splattering :DI asked for lemonade but they were out of lemonade, so I opted for lime-adeService was off/slow, and it took until we were finished with our meals to get the lime-ade drinksVery small place, only seats about 25-26 people.  They seem to cater more to a take out business.  HVAC does not appear to work well, very hot/humid inside the restaurant.Looking forward to a return visit to try the Pho."
2015-07-13,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tijuana Flats,"This is the best franchise of Tijuana Flats I have ever been to. The staff just kills you with their kindness! The food is always fresh and made just the way you ask for it. I love coming here as they are quick, efficient and spot on as to exactly what customer service is about.

2015-07-13,3.0,"Bartlett, IL",Brio Tuscan Grille,"Starting with the good. Patio, 19 Crimes Red Blend and caprese salad (though it could've stood a touch less salad dressing). Granted, even though it's an Italian joint, I opted for the crab crusted something or another salmon as a part of their prix fixe featured menu. The chopped salad was bad, cold and full of tasteless iceberg lettuce. The salmon was flavored, but too dry as was the quinoa it was bedded on. The roasted carrots were good though and worthy of extras. Don't get me wrong, everything was edible, just not what I expected from the reviews and external ambiance. I think the kitchen needs to step it up and this could be a fun hangout. The food deserves two stars, but the third is for good service and ambiance."
2015-07-13,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Rockford,"I'm just sad. The Rockford used to be awesome, with a great menu. The ""revamped"" menu is now completely different, except for the ABC sandwich. It's much shorter and less varied. No more seasonal sides either, and those were so good. They dumbed down the wine list too. The only reason I didn't give 1 star is that the food we ordered did taste good. I got a grilled romaine salad. NONE of the new sandwiches appealed to me. Having gone to the Rockford for about 10 years, I feel like it's the end of an era."

2015-07-13,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",PDQ,"I've eaten at 6 different PDQ restaurants. This last visit is the reason for my review. I got the Crispy chicken sandwich with fries and a drink for like $8-9. Nothing really great this time around. The sandwich bun completely fell apart turning it into a knife and fork meal. The fries were just okay, warm at best, and, if you have ever eaten here, you know to eat them quick as they are not that great after about 15 minutes. Quality control can be an issue for them as they continue to expand as a company. My kid loves the chicken fingers though, you cant go wrong there, as they are always good."

2015-07-14,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Players Retreat,"A great dive bar with awesome food. If you are looking for something simple and delicious then PTs is your place. They have a great sidewalk patio with misters so you never get to hot. Bring the pups and enjoy a meal al fresco.They have food and drink specials everyday so be sure to check out their website. I've heard amazing things about their burgers and I was not disappointed. You must order the Mimi's sausage dip as well, I love that they served it with corn chips a nice snack for a table to share.I ordered the Gaby burger with bacon, provolone, lettuce, tomato, onion & mayo this is one of their smaller burgers but I still didn't finish it. Big plus that you can order your burger exactly how you like it, even rare since they ground all their beef in house. My burger was cooked to perfection. I decided to have a house salad as my side since they make their own dressings. Well this was way more then a side salad it was huge and the blue cheese dressing was definitely homemade. I would come back just for a salad.I noticed they have a huge wine list and scotch list apparently they have clubs for both. If you are looking for late night eats they serve breakfast till 2am  Thurs. - Sat and all day on Sunday!This bar has been here since 1951 and it's not going anywhere. A popular spot for NC State students and fans but also you will see an older crowd of folks enjoying brews and good food.I don't know what has taken me so long to check this place out. I have a feeling I will be here quite often when I'm in the mood for some pub grubbin'"

Not only was this place a homey, friendly, off the beaten path gem, it was a gastro treasure. OH MY GOODNESS!  I had the fried green tomatoes with relish, seafood and grits (sans bacon) and roasted beet salad; all perfectly seasoned, prepared and delivered.  Chad the bartender (or mixologist, don't know what they're called in the south LOL) was really friendly and a good host.I sat at the bar and there were a couple of locals who claimed Glenwood as their normal neighborhood spot and I see why.  Great find, great time."
2015-07-14,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Ole Time Barbecue,"I thought Ole Time was alright. The barbecue was typical for the Raleigh area- not smoky at all. Ours was both kind of mushy for chopped barbecue.

It wasn't a bad lunch but far from the best East Carolina BBQ around, especially if you're willing to drive a little further."

Then I discovered the catfish tacos, then the chicken salad, then their take on the Greek salad, then their tomato bisque. Now I'm all confused when I go in there because everything is so freaking delicious and made with love that I never know what to try next. Also, their sweet potato fries are the best I've ever tasted. That may sound like hyperbole, but I've tried many, many sweet potato fries. Bonus, the owner is incredibly kind and checks in to make sure our meals are good. He encourages me to try different things, which I WILL do because I haven't met an entree that's made me even remotely sad yet. I looooooooove eating here!"
2015-07-14,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",BURGERFI,"Overpriced and incredibly slow. The counter also smelled of stale beer. Would not go again.Edit: reply to Burgerfi: all well and good but you have to execute as well. If you want to charge premium prices, you'd best have premium results and service. Waiting 25 minutes for a burger and then being told they forgot to make it because they thought it was a phone order ( I was a walk in) and then forgetting a topping when I did receive it is not acceptable. Nor did you address the cleanliness issue of uncleaned bar taps. Thanks for the cut and pasted corporate speak, though..."
2015-07-14,4.0,"Cary, NC",The Mecca Restaurant,"One of, if not the oldest, surviving restaurant in Raleigh still does classic southern food right.  I'm ashamed to say that I have lived here a decade and this was my first visit, but, I made it! My husband and I stopped in for lunch on Saturday right around 11AM.  It's a small place tucked on Martin St that has so much character and charm.  I ordered chicken salad, macaroni salad, and cantaloupe.  My husband had a cheeseburger and fires.  Both were all great classics.  I will say the macaroni salad is on the mustard side (in case you aren't expecting it). The service was on point.  I'm pretty sure the owner and his wife were in there working.  Personally, I think that tells a lot about a place... mainly, they care. While I would love to make it down during the week, we look forward to another weekend stop in the future."
2015-07-15,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Randy’s Pizza,"Usually Randy's is exceptional. From the service to the pizza. We even had a driver deliver pizza to us at the apt complex pool once. The pizza is very good. Today, I tried to order a pizza for delivery for lunch. There is a coupon online for a 16"" cheese pizza for $10.99. So I told the guy (turns out he was the manager) that answered the phone about the coupon and he said ""ok hold on"" and disappeared for about 5 minutes and I was on hold. He then comes back and I tried to finish my order. ""I would like to add pepperoni"". I was rudely informed that you can't add a topping to a pizza when you use a coupon. You seriously can't let them charge you more money for an additional topping. Why you ask? Because they ""don't have a button for that and accounting will be severely messed up"". THEN the guy wanted me to ADD an item to my order to meet the minimum delivery charge. So, I would have had to add another item (that wasn't needed) to get the cheese pizza.... Wouldn't it have made more sense to just add the pepperoni and please the customer???? No worries though, papa johns had a coupon for an XL 3 topping pizza for $12.99."

2015-07-15,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",State Farmers Market Restaurant,I've never been disappointed after eating here. The only thing that disappointed me was how long I went without knowing about it! Try out any style chicken they make and you will be happy you did. You literally receive half of a chicken. I couldn't believe myself when I ordered it for the first time. Check it out and go across the street to the actual farmers market afterward and support local business!

You want all that with a low price tag? The three of us stopped into Big Al's one afternoon really not knowing what to expect. What we found was really excellent barbecue with many traditional southern sides. Everything prepared to perfection! Service brief and good!Go there or be square! We are off to another bbq fav in a few days; Kabota Grill in Raleigh.  Think ""big green egg"" turns restaurant pro! Can't wait to try it."
2015-07-16,4.0,"Charlotte, NC",Red Pepper Asian,"I'm skeptical of many restaurants - especially little ones stuck in strip malls(??). I read the Yelp comments on this one and I was NOT disappointed. I had the wonton soup-best ever. The broth wasn't just run of the mill- it and the wontons were superb (this over wonton soup?). I opted for the basil chicken dish - BEST DECISION !! Not only the best Thai meal - but really best meal in a long while.My friend, who is very well traveled in these regions, loved every bite as well.I will return- no doubt!I strongly recommend this little restaurant !"
2015-07-16,5.0,"New York, NY",The Rockford,"Not bad, but not a place to rave about. I had one of the sandwich choices but over greens and, well, maybe it would have been better as a sandwich? The turkey was grilled and therefore rather bland-- no rub or sauce to liven it up. And even though the bacon added flavor (as one would expect) to the salad, the shaved brussells sprouts had no treatment to give them personality.Still, acceptable.Service seemed a bit unenthusiastic, but maybe I arrived after a lunch rush?"

2015-07-16,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Taste Small Plates | Wine Bar,"We went in at 9:30 and they wouldn't seat us outside. Not because it was so busy, there were multiple tables open, but because we had 5 in our party and they wouldn't combine tables or allow a fifth chair at a 4 top. Now I get it's 30 minutes to close and you don't want to put forth the effort of moving tables and if they would have said some fire code or pathway problem is why they don't allow pulling up a chair but it was company policy. So I have eaten here before and the food is good, but to be so insistent means the trendiness has gone to their heads. This is Raleigh not soho."
2015-07-16,1.0,"Washington, DC",Taste Small Plates | Wine Bar,Amazing food. The melon medley was the best the Bartender Lamar really helpful In selecting a wine to pair.
2015-07-17,3.0,"New York, NY",NOFO At the Pig,Lunch special of pan fried trout over a grits cake for $7.95? Delicious? Yes and yes. Just an overall pleasant lunch experience with a waitperson as sweet as Carolina iced tea.
2015-07-17,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Despina’s Cafe,"Love this European style cafe.  No bothersome muzak.  Tasty, unique, fresh and totally house made menu items.  Fantastic pastries.  Smell as well as eat a slice of lavender cake! Have a salad with the only cheese that doesn't melt from Cypress-great flavor and texture.  A relaxing oasis to refresh and relax with family and friends for lunch or coffee and treats."
2015-07-17,4.0,"Apex, NC",Sosta Café,We need more of this kind of cafes! The food is AMAZING and really tastes authentic French food (no wonder because the chef is from France!). The decor of the place is fun and I'm happy that they have really kept the European atmosphere :)
2015-07-17,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",BURGERFI,"Neat idea but the burger was so-so (extra well done dry) and my fries were greasy/limpy.  After waiting what seemed like 10mins I had hoped all would be 'off the grill' fresh.  Tried it once, for the price of a burger/fry/drink I didn't get the value that I expected."
2015-07-17,5.0,"Apex, NC",b.good,"So-called ""healthy"" places like this one make me feel like they should be exceptionally good, but my experience here was just average. It's pretty inside, located within an equally attractive Raleigh  business locale. The area's not bleeding available on-street parking, but you can make it work.Order and pay to the right, grab a seat, and wait for your food. The service was moderately timely and not standoffish. It seems like the seating would run out quickly during hot times, but I wouldn't know. I was there around 1pm and stood in a long line that moved swiftly. I had a buffalo sauce burger, side salad and 3 Greens Smoothie. There wasn't much to the burger, but it was okay. And side salads aren't designed to blow anyone's mind, so no big deal there either. What I really enjoyed was the smoothie. It went down easily and didn't taste bland like some green drinks.Didn't blow me away. However, looking at some of the other customer's meals, this place looks like a prime stop for when you feel like eating super healthy stuff like the Power Bowl for $9.59 - kale, grains, local egg, carrots, brussels sprouts, shiitake crisps, pepitas, tomato vinaigrette. I just didn't have that plan at the time."
2015-07-17,2.0,"Wahiawa, HI",BURGERFI,Where to start?!!! This place is awesome not my first time here but it's definitely worth every penny you spend them burgers are made fresh as you order in the fries are cooked freshoh and did I mention the red velvet concrete... Delicious and the staff is friendly!!! Don't get that everywhere you go.
2015-07-17,5.0,"Knightdale, NC",BURGERFI,Good Food but ridiculously overpriced! Burgers range from $5 to $8 excluding toppings and everything is a la carte..no combos! A small drink is $2.50 and fries start at $3.25...you do the math..pretty expensive for one person
2015-07-17,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Mecca Restaurant,"Old school luncheonette in downtown Raleigh. This place is worth checking out as I enjoyed the authentic feel of the place, and the southern cooking was spot on. It's not fancy, and the food isn't gourmet, but the price is right and they've been doing their thing here a long time so you have to respect that."
2015-07-17,3.0,"Morristown, NJ",Plates Neighborhood Kitchen,Farm to table type of restaurant with a menu that changes frequently depending on local ingredients! I ordered a fish dish which was pretty underwhelming. The veggies I ordered with it was phenomenal though. My friends ordered a creamy pasta dish which was YUM! Shame pasta doesn't usually fit my macros otherwise I would've loved to help them eat more of their dish. The one reason I would definitely return though...their Rosemary bread. Had them refill us on bread three times because it was so so good!
2015-07-17,2.0,"Hillsborough, NC",The Oak,"I went here with a group of friends on a Thursday, 1/2 price wine day. We sat outside and it was a very nice area, blocked off from visitors to the rest of the shopping center by nice potted bushes. We ordered some of the 1/2 price appetizers, which everyone enjoyed.The three stars are for a few reasons. The service was okay but not great. They wouldn't work with a guest who wanted to switch out an ingredient, and basically said to trust the chef that it was good. The guest did not enjoy that ingredient and she was stuck with it. They also had a clear typo on the menu where they switched the price of bottle vs glass of wine, but the waiter said that the higher price was for the glass. She went in and checked and, of course, the prices were switched and it was NOT more expensive for a glass than bottle.Also, even though it was 1/2 price wine night, the sparkling and rose wines were not included in that deal, but that isn't posted anywhere. The waiter had to come back out and tell us this after some had already ordered sparkling wines.I'll probably be back now that I know what to expect, and the food WAS good, as was the wine."
2015-07-17,5.0,"Charlotte, NC",Mami Nora’s,"Oh. My. God. Mami Nora's gives an entire new meaning to rotisserie chicken. Quarter chicken white meat, peels right off of the bone. It was messy to eat in my car while driving, but do trust that I figured it out. Easy access off of 440, stopped by here on my way back into Charlotte from the beach. Raleigh has a cool feature that you can order for pick up through yelp (I think it's called Eat Street), so I was able to bypass the literally 19 people in line. Just walked right up to the pick up area, and it was sitting there with a piece of paper with my name on it. I ordered while getting gas up the street, and it was ready by the time I showed up. The green sauce they gave me was yummy, the yellow I didn't care for, but it wasn't bad. They also have a bottled hot sauce near the napkin/tea station if you really want some heat like I do. The yucca fries were humongous, but I will have to say I was disappointed in the coleslaw. Too soupy, too much sauce. I eat regularly at Viva Chicken in Charlotte which I think is very good, but I have to say, Mami Nora's chicken is better."
2015-07-17,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gringo A Go-Go,"We tried Gringos for lunch today and the food was fantastic.  Very authentic Mexican, which from what I understand are simple dishes that do not come with a lot of ""bells and whistles"".  The service was great and the restaurant was simple and casual.  If you're looking for large portions that are more American-Mexican (think Torero's or maybe even Gonza's) you probably won't enjoy a visit here, but I highly recommend at least giving it a try.  The corn tortillas are so good and I enjoyed the condiment tray.  The interior of the building is a little rough, but I liked that about this place.  Can't wait to go back after work hours and have dinner with a few adult beverages."
2015-07-18,5.0,"Durham, NC",Char-Grill,Thank god for this place and bless the heart of every poor soul who has to work here and deal with drunkies on the late shift.

As always, the food was excellent, well-prepared, and nicely presented. I got the lamb and it was as tender as ever. The winning rating for this place is that the owners have been there for over 25 years and are simply wonderful people. Friendly, understanding, genuine, and great at what they do. Looking forward to my next visit."

2015-07-18,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",State of Beer,"When it comes to sandwiches, I always think of places like Toast out in Durham. Taking a humble sammich and making it special isn't as easy as it sounds. But thankfully, State of Beer is up to the challenge! Part bottle shop, part sandwich shop, State of Beer toes the line between the two really well.Out front, State of Beer sports a large parking lot patio with plenty of tables. Inside they've got a large retail bottle area, good number of refrigerated cases and their beer/sandwich counter. With 8 or so beers on tap along with 8 or so sandwiches, I went with an Italian for my first go. Put together with Yellow Dog baguette bread, my Italian is well-stuffed with plenty of freshly cut sandwich meat, bibb lettuce, provolone and viniagrette. Very tasty and fresh. Paired with some chips and you've got yourself a good lunch.So I'm happy to say that Raleigh's latest bottle shop is doing things really well. The bar keeps on getting raised and State of Beer comfortably makes it over that bar with great beer and excellent sandwiches..."

We had the brownie with pecans for dessert without the whipped cream and it was delicious as well. Overall good experience and would recommend it."
2015-07-18,5.0,"Winston-Salem, NC",Chubby’s Tacos,"Delicious tacos and fantastic salsa bar. I had the daily special pork taco and the fried tilapia taco on flour tortilla as per servers recommendation. Both were freshly prepared and flavorful. The salsa bar has over eight different salsas each with distinct flavors and bases, not simply different grades of ""I'm going to regret this"" spiciness. I loved the dark smoky red salsa with the complimentary chips. Three personal points: 1 turn up the AC it's hot. 2 the Latin club music is nerve wracking and detracts from whatever ambiance you might be hoping for. 3 clean the walls of the booths. Dried drips of food are not cool no matter how good it was before it hit the wall. Overall, I would DEFINITELY return and recommend this place if only for the great flavors."
2015-07-18,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Big Al’s BBQ,Great bbq. I've had the ribs and the pork sandwich. Both were great. Okra and Mac and cheese are my go to sides

We had the lamb meatballs, the scallops and the pork belly sliders. The scallops were under cooked and the white and green sauce was just ok. Pork belly sliders were ok but nothing to write home about. I probably won't come back any time soon."

2015-07-19,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Backyard Bistro,"5 Stars for the food, which is INCREDIBLE. 5 Stars for the beer and liquor selection. 5 stars for the service. Best buy is the colossal wedge with ahi tuna on the side. Must try is the redneck eggrolls. Of course the BBQ is excellent, as are the mandatory sides of tater salad and cole slaw. There's nothing on this menu that is not good. Every meal has been excellent and you will not be disappointed - BUT - I cannot figure out why this sports bar with awesome food is not packed daily...Although I believe it has something to do with their goofy hours, which thoroughly SUCK. The cooks clearly love to cook and are darn good at it; The bartenders are excellent at their craft although their personalities are more in line with a bar attached to a Holiday Inn (bland) - But it does mean you'll have an awesome seat (inside OR outside) and excellent, attentive service when you pop in. And you should! My only complaints are they close way too early and have no live music. Why, why, WHY they do not tap into the much-needed later-late night bar market is beyond me. I hate being able to only come here for a late lunch on a weekend."

We ordered the Cristos (white pizza) topped with spinach, black olives, sundries tomatoes, cheese and artichokes and the mild wings. Both were so disappointing. I had to recook the pizza, it was so underdone and even after that and putting extra season salt on it there still was somehow NO flavor. The wings were soggy and had no sauce on them, just under them. The sauce was ok, delivery was fast and the last two times I ordered I was very happy with my food so I'm going with three stars. I'm so incredibly sad. Mostly because it's expensive pizza. I kinda feel like I just wasted my money."
2015-07-19,4.0,"Cary, NC",State Farmers Market Restaurant,Great spot for breakfast after some shopping at State Farmers Market. Be ready to be seated at the counter unless you are eager to wait. What can I saw that has already not been said about the place. Greatest biscuit ever. Period. Coffee is quiet weak not something that can wake you up in the morning. Superb service.
2015-07-19,4.0,"Cary, NC",Black Cat Cafe,"Huevos rancheros, while not exactly done in a traditional way, was still expertly prepared and ingredients were fresh. I found the decor to be fun and lively and the patio is super in with a wall that gives a sense of separation from the parking lot and the shopping mall atmosphere. I went there for breakfast but the rest of the menu looked absolutely delicious. I will go again and again."

2015-07-19,5.0,"Washington, DC",Mellow Mushroom,"Great pizza, NOT date-friendly!  I've been here several times and it's always loud- lots of kids and rowdy groups.   The selection of local beers and awesome servers almost makes the noise bearable.  I love that a tray of pizza condiments accompanies the order- no awkward running around to find the one oregano jar like at some pizza places.  Anyway.  The little signs all over the place about ""no pets allowed on the porch"" are really obnoxious.  I get it that I can't bring my dog- that's definitely another conversation btw- but multiple signs reminding me just seems like, mean."
2015-07-19,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Serena Sicilian Influenced Cucina,"Pretty great place, consistently. The menu is awesome; you can design your own dish whether pasta, pizza, salad, or sandwich.

We had a little wait because it was super packed for Sunday brunch (@11:30ish) but got our table quickly and have absolutely no complaints. Sara the manager does a phenomenal job and our waitress Meredith rocked also! Most of our group got the flying biscuit Benedict and loved it. I got the steak and eggs and have to say it's the best I've had in a long time and I just moved from Chicago, a quasi-capital of steaks. Fresh coffee and delicious mimosas were great too. I'll definitely be coming back despite the high chances of a wait for a table - totally worth it! Next time I'll probably sit outside or even at the bar."

2015-07-20,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mo-Te Vietnamese Restaurant,"My daughter and I visited Mo-Te twice in one week,mostly for the bubble tea, but the Banh Mi  was very good as well.  The service was really slow,only one lady working in the entire restaurant.  She took orders from customers in the restaurant as well as to go orders on the phone and also did the cooking,cleaning and checked you out. I felt sorry for her and left her a 25% tip on both occasions not because the service was great but because I could see she was working really hard. When we returned for a third time she told us ""I am too busy to serve you...I don't have time to make bubble tea"". I was so taken back that I was speechless. I have never had a restaurant tell me they were too busy to serve me! Will not return after that comment."
2015-07-20,1.0,"Morrisville, NC",Chuy’s,"Chuy's looked suspiciously not packed at 7pm on a Friday night, but I was meeting friends there and changing the venue was not an option. The inside is nicely decorated with hundreds of dog pictures, Mexican-inspired stuff and bright colors all over. Very inviting space, so why would it be half empty on a Friday night? Let me start with the drinks. The drink menu contained a lot of sugary drinks and ""skinny"" options with agave nectar. Let me tell you. Agave nectar is still sugar, and the only way to make your drink skinny is to not dump a load of sweeteners into it. After some deliberation i decided to pick a classic mojito, hoping it would be the least sugary option. Not bad, still a bit too sweet, but with enough alcohol where you can't taste it, but get buzzed. My companion had a sangria which she said was much too sweet. The entire party arrived as we were seated promptly and served by Ian, super friendly and attentive. He was quick to give us loads of chips and salsa (delicious) while we were waiting on food. The food menu doesn't have a lot of options, but has the basics covered: a few tacos, enchiladas, burritos, salads and combinations of those. We got some queso and guac with our chips, both were yummy. The entrees is where disappointment begins. I ordered 2 enchiladas (chicka chicka boom boom). The name and the waiter's mention of it bring very popular promised loads of flavor. Not so. The enchiladas came coated with spicy sauce, with a side of very spicy rice and somewhat spicy refried beans. Even the sad pile of lettuce next to them was spicy from the sauce. I don't know bout you, but I think it's nice to have at least 1 non-spicy item on a plate for palate relief. The enchiladas were ok, with boiled chicken and cheese inside, plus a whole bunch of spicy. It got gross when I noticed boiled chicken skin inside. You know how appetizing that looked. Luckily I was able to extract it all without gagging. Everybody else's plate looked about just as blah as mine, no one commented on how good the food was and no one felt compelled to try off others' plates (a normal thing in our circle). The friend closest to me had a salad, which mostly consisted of a giant fried tortilla shell and some mixed greens with chicken. In summary: great decor, awesome service, lower than mediocre food. I won't be back."

2015-07-20,3.0,"Richmond, VA",State Farmers Market Restaurant,"I had to drop off some friends to Wilmington, NC so I stopped by Raleigh, NC on my drive back to Richmond (figured I'd see another state capital). Had to find a restaurant open early enough for breakfast, so I pulled out the trusty Yelp app.I arrived at State Farmers Market Restaurant only a few minutes after it opened at 8AM, so I was probably one of the first 10-20 customers. A bunch of servers were lined up near the entrance (I think they take turns), and mine brought me to my seat as well as tended to me during my meal. Cameron did a great job and was very friendly, enthusiastic, and attentive. The restaurant is fairly large and located across the street from the actual Farmers Market in the State Farmers Market complex. There is plenty of parking. The interior is spacious and bright.I ordered the chicken fried steak with two eggs over easy, grits, and red-eye gravy. I had never even heard of red-eye gravy, but it was basically a savory clear sap-colored liquid that Cameron said was made from coffee beans. It was very salty but flavorful, and I mixed it in with my grits to eat. My meal also came with a biscuit; the restaurant is famous for their ""real biscuits"" and I definitely enjoyed the light, fluffy texture of the biscuits. They were hot and fresh out of the oven, and had an interesting crust that is a little chewy. I enjoyed the biscuit thoroughly, but echo another Yelp review's comment that it would be nice to have some fresh local jam to pair with instead of pre-packaged Smuckers. The chicken fried steak was a good size and covered in peppery white gravy. Overall, food and service was excellent and I had a great breakfast! I hear they have some nice lunch specials as well. I would definitely recommend dining here, perhaps in conjunction with a visit to the Farmers Market itself!P.S. I got a check-in comment from fellow Elite Timmy T. after my meal when I was checking out the actual Farmers Market. Apparently, he was at the restaurant at nearly the same time! Two Richmonders in Raleigh on a random Sunday morning; serendipity at its finest! =D"

2015-07-20,5.0,"Goldsboro, NC",Shaba Shabu,"Shaba shabu is one of my fav restaurants. They have amazing sushi, thailandese dishes, and spectacular deserts. I love the pineapple fried rice, and the Kobe beef has always been cooked and served deliciously not mentioning the beautiful presentation. Some of the friends that I have brought to this restaurant have  the same opinion. Keep it up Shaba Shabu!!"

Love milkshakes and flavored drinks! I've had burgers, Kale bowls and sweet potato fries and have never been disappointed"
2015-07-21,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",P.G. Werth’s,"OK, tried dinner with a few crazy friends and everything we got, and I mean everything was outstanding! I had the Vegan Pot Roast and it was the best thing ever, full of fresh vegetables, chunks of carrots and beets and it was something my grandmother would've made had she been a vegetarian, but she was an alcoholic and only made Cuban Pot Roast with MEAT! And like Morrissey says MEAT IS MURDER! The service here is always impeccable, we had a great gal named Amy? It was an A name (Sorry Easy A, I've aged by now and have smoked one too many bowls)  and she was spot on about everything, including her genuine smile. Chef Jambon really has won my tummy! This is 3 times in one month! More times than I've had sex this month! PG Werth is a subtle sexual dream with a farm boy!"
2015-07-21,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mandolin,"Farm-to-table cuisine with a great summer selection. The pork ribs were delectable and the tile fish light and tasty. The cocktails were well balanced and the ambience was lovely.  Ashley, our waitress, was friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. Will definitely add this to my list of favorite places in the Triangle."
2015-07-22,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Night Kitchen Bakehouse & Cafe,"Small, quaint little place tucked into a corner at Seaboard. Incredibly friendly, no pressure kind of staff in a very laid back atmosphere. If I lived closer I could definitely see myself going there to grab a drink a drink/pastry and relax. I've been there only twice and both times I got the brownie. It is probably one of the best brownies I've ever had-dark dark chocolate, extremely rich and decadent.  With tax it comes to 43 and change.  If you don't see it in the display case, ask if they have any in the back-you can thank me later."
2015-07-22,5.0,"Greensboro, NC",J Betski’s,All the delicious flavors of Eastern Europe right here on West Franklin Street in Downtown Raleigh. The beer selection is wonderful but the food is the star. The chef/owner puts so much love into each recipe you can actually taste it! Don't keep looking for where to go tonight... You just found it!
2015-07-22,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tijuana Flats,"Great food, great service, very little wait. I always get their burrito and it is well worth it. Great taste and quality."
2015-07-22,2.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Kabab and Curry,"My favorite Indian food in the Triangle (unless you're looking for South Indian which isn't in K&C's wheelhouse). The Kadai curries are all great, the bhindi masala is some of the best non-fried okra I've eaten anywhere, the kormas are chock full of nuts and spices. The momo are sort of lacking but nowhere else around really does it so it's awesome to see that Nepalese treat on any menu. Likewise with the chaat. The spice levels are always tame regardless of how much you plead for spiciness but they have a nice chili oil they will gladly bring out which packs a punch. I've liked everything here I've tried."
2015-07-22,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",b.good,"I was excited last year when I saw this place was opening up and really looked forward to trying it...b. good is a great concept and their food is pretty good - if you happen to get it fresh and timely. It's certainly not fresh homemade, nor even Whole Foods food bar quality, but it isn't bad for what it is and for the price.The problem is they can't seem to get an order ready, any order, in any sort of reasonable time frame. OMG, I could have gone next door to Chuey's, been seated, ordered, served, finished & paid and then walked backed to b. good in time to pick up my order... WTF? Initially I gave them the benefit of doubt, reasoning that it was a new restaurant, new people and a big learning curve... But this has happened EVERY SINGLE TIME. This last time was a take out order which was phoned in ahead of time. They quoted 10 minutes, my husband arrived later & still had to wait 20 more minutes.At the time of this post, they've been open several months. Long enough to get their shit together.While the folks are really nice, it almost seems like the kids are home alone and no one is paying attention to the sinking ship?This place REALLY needs to get their act together if they expect to succeed at North Hills. Step it up b. good!"
2015-07-22,4.0,"JACKSON HEIGHTS, NY",Capital Club 16,"I visit my company's office nearby with some regularity, and this is my favorite lunching spot in the area. It's just very good for what it is, which is unpretentious American food with some other influences. The take-away sandwiches are all great."
2015-07-22,2.0,"Butner, NC",Mellow Mushroom,"After reading all of the yelp reviews and looking at the menu, I decided to try Mellow Mushroom. We had it delivered to our hotel room. We got the Holy Shiitake Pizza and a Brutus salad. The pizza was warm (I don't expect piping hot pizza for delivery) and thankfully the salad was still cool and crisp. The mushrooms for the salad were wrapped separatly which kept the whole thing from wilting. Brilliant. I had high expectations and they were totally met. The salad had the perfect combination of salty, bitter, sweet, with textures of crunchy lettuce and the pop of the mushroom and olive. The pizza was layered with flavors. Neither the garlic or onion were too overpowering, which let the delicate flavor of mushrooms shine through. It all melded perfectly. I am eager to come back to Raleigh to try even more of their great food."
2015-07-23,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Roast Grill,"Things to see inside this tiny place. Small in size but has plenty of character, hospitality and delicious hot dogs. PS - chili is a long-time family recipe. Get it on your hot dog when you go there! Tootsie Rolls are the dessert/parting gifts.  Raleigh landmark. IMHO."
2015-07-23,5.0,"Myrtle Beach, SC",Babylon Restaurant,"Absolutely fantastic!! Great atmosphere, friendly waitstaff and great bartenders. In all my years I have never ate lamb that tasted like this.

2015-07-23,4.0,"Durham, NC",The Rockford,Best farm to table choices in raleigh! Humble service. Specially chosen local beer choices!
2015-07-23,3.0,"Cary, NC",b.good,"Was super excited to try b.good, but left kind of disappointed mainly because I felt like it was pricey for what I got. Maybe thats cheap of me? I ordered the spicy avocado and lime quinoa and kale bowl. I just got a cup of water and with tax my meal was over $10. The portion size of the bowl was just right for me for that meal, but others (any guy) probably would have left hungry or had to spend more. The food was fresh and yummy, but I didn't really feel like the price matched. Maybe if I had gotten a drink or a side or something with it, I would have felt more satisfied. So that being said, yummy, fresh, healthy food, but in my opinion (on my student budget), kind of expensive."
2015-07-23,4.0,"Clarksville, VA",BURGERFI,"My husband and I ate here on our way to The Ritz for a concert. We have eaten here one other time about a year ago, and the food is still amazing. Good burgers and excellent fries and onion rings. He can't wait to go back and get another burger!"
2015-07-23,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Hayes Barton Café & Dessertery,The coconut cake is out of this world.Customer service leaves a bit to be desired. I'd recommend grabbing a slice and then leaving - the space tries to cram a lot of seats into it and it's obvious that the servers aren't interested in being there.
2015-07-23,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Serena Sicilian Influenced Cucina,"Let me say two things (1) they were out of the nightly drink special.  Don't you plan ahead for nightly specials? duh!  MORE IMPORTANTLY!!!!(2)   I was sitting at the bar next to the pizza station.  I see a guy training another guy on how to make pizza [on the other side of the glass].  Watching, I see guy # 1 spill pizza sauce, SCOOP IT UP WITH HIS HAND, and fling it back on the pizza to be cooked.    I summon the host over and am like:  ""That is revolting.  You need to tell the manager there is a very unsanitary guy making pizzas; I am going to vomit.""  I wondered then why the host guy was so nervous and anxious about my complaint.  [no fault to him, he was trying to cover as I guess a good employee should]YOU KNOW WHY =====  Turns out the the filthy guy was the owner.   I nearly vomited.   Can you imagine how disgusting this place is?  I didn't even know what to say or do.   When the waiter came over to take our food order I said ""no thanks, I have lost my appetite.   I'll just have this sub-drink and leave.""  BLAH   BLAH BLAH BLAH"
2015-07-24,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tacos Y Mariscos Vallarta,"Good, authentic food. I had a combo platter and was very pleased.  The salsa is a little bland-almost seems watered down, but the food makes up for it. This is not your average food spot! They have some really unique dishes on the menu that you can't get at a lot of other similar places. You get a lot of food for the money, too. The service-especially when it come to cashing out-could be a bit quicker, but they are always pretty busy, so it's for good reason."
2015-07-24,4.0,"Durham, NC",Chuy’s,"After being back to Chuy's a few times after my initial review, I have come to the conclusion that I rated them a bit too high initially. 99% of the reason I have to mark down is the food. I had the steak burrito last time I was there and it tasted rather bland and tasteless. The rice and beans that came with the burrito were just ok too. I actually think Yard House has better Tex-Mex type food with their street taco offerings. I still like and appreciate the staff at Chuy's though, and think the ambiance and location are great too. The down-grade to three stars is just for the bland, un-original Tex-Mex food as compared to the many other places in town serving similar, and much better food."
2015-07-24,4.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Pam’s Farm House,"I was quite disappointed when I ate here. I read all the great reviews, and had high hopes for this place. I went with two other people, and we all agreed that we could have made the food that we ate and saved a couple bucks. We all ordered breakfast plates, which were filling but not impressive. This place can be a little easy to miss. Side bar: there's a big sign outside that says the GOAT, which my friends explained to me meant ""Greatest of All Time"" - mind blown! Inside, it looks like a usual diner, and everyone we encountered inside was polite. There are only a few staple things on their menu, but lots of different combinations. The biggest downside is that they only accept cash, but there is an ATM machine you can withdraw money from with a $2 charge - oh joy. Needless to say, I was thoroughly unimpressed and don't plan on coming back to this place again."
2015-07-24,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Players Retreat,"I used to love going to PR. My dad had his first beer here. It's a Raleigh staple. Unfortunately, the new management has ruined it. Price's have been jacked up and the breakfast menu is gone. $15 for a beer and a burger? You're clearly delusional.When the new management gets a clue please let me know. Come on Gus...think of the children."
2015-07-24,5.0,"Wake Forest, NC",Saint Jacques,"We ate here about 2 months ago and there is a reason this place is rated one of the top restaurants in Raleigh.  Where do I start? The ambience is quaint, not too large. The service is good, the servers are friendly and attentive without being annoying. Last but not least, the food is delicious.  At my visit our group shared the frogs legs, French onion soup, the pate, Coquille St Jacques and my personal entrée was the lamb loin.  Everything was delicious..the only thing I didn't really care for was the French onion soup but my sister loved hers.  Great restaurant!!"
2015-07-24,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Monapita Mediterranean Grill,"This place is amazing! Fantastic food for an affordable price. My friend and I have been there twice now, and the second time they remembered our orders from 2+ weeks ago! The Lebanese family that owns it is very friendly and charming. I got the falafel pita, which was delicious. I meant to take a picture,  but when it arrived it smelled so good I had to start eating it right away.The interior is clean and well-lit, but there's also a patio area outside with cute umbrellas where you can eat. This is a good setup for large parties, plus there's a kid's menu for family convenience.Also be sure to try their desserts--the baklava is just right (I prefer the light flaky kind that doesn't drool honey down your shirt) and the cheesecake selection looks great.Seriously, if you like Mediterranean and are in the Raleigh area, try it out!"
2015-07-24,2.0,"Charlottesville, VA",Mura,"Had a lunch special here. It included several different types of sushi, none of which I liked."
2015-07-24,4.0,"Carrboro, NC",Bolt Bistro,Went during restaurant week on the advice from some friends and wasn't disappointed. The steak was one of the best I've had. My girlfriend was also very pleased with her meal. We will be going back at some point not during restaurant week to try some more of their menu options.
2015-07-24,1.0,"Norfolk, VA",Black Cat Cafe,"We drove through Raleigh while on vacation and this place was on our way. We were happy to see so many vegetarian options. The salad basket sandwich was delicious and our favorite between our meals. We got the creme brulee with fresh strawberries for dessert. Creme brulee is one of my favorite dishes and they did a great job with it. Definitely hit the spot! On top of the great food, the service could not be friendlier. We felt right at home."
2015-07-24,5.0,"Garner, NC",The Oak,We really enjoyed our evening!! The food was great- the filet was cooked perfectly and the pimento cheese egg burger was awesome! I would eat that every day. Our server did a nice job of suggesting cocktails that paired well with the entrees. It is a bit loud but expected for that size venue. Can't wait to come back and try some of the other menu offerings.
2015-07-24,5.0,"Carrboro, NC",The Oak,My girlfriend and I went during restaurant week. The food was above average but I was underwhelmed by the portion sizes (could've just been because we ordered the restaurant week menu). My filet was good but couldn't have been more than 4 oz. The mac & cheese portion was equally small. I stopped for more food on my way home from The Oak because I was still hungry.
2015-07-25,3.0,"Apex, NC",Anvil’s Cheesesteaks,Came in for lunch today. Cheese steaks are very good. Birch beer was awesome. You cant find that stuff around here so thats a plus. Just a little pricey. But great food
2015-07-25,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",NOFO At the Pig,The decor is really cute.  The food is bland with little or no taste. The service is outstanding. I had the prime rib which was ok.  My son had the swordfish which had no taste even done with a jerk seasoning.  I probably won't go back.
2015-07-25,5.0,"Goldsboro, NC",Sullivan’s Steakhouse,"This place was great. My husband took me here for my birthday last weekend & we could not stop raving about how great we enjoyed the food & service on our drive back home. Only reason I didn't give it full stars is because of some minor things (see below):Environment:Ambiance was great. We sat at one of the rounded booths & enjoyed its location and the comfy booth... Especially since we had the whole booth to ourselves.Appetizer: We ordered the crab cake & we were a little sad at the portion size, but it was delicious. I ordered the lobster and crab bisque & even that was so good.Entree:My husband ordered the dry aged prime rib with a side of mashed potatoes. He loved the steak, it was cooked to perfection (medium) and the garlic sauce he chose really kicked it up a notch. Unfortunately he never touched the mashed potatoes because it was entirely too dry. He called it Sahara mashed potatoes. I ordered the seared ahi tuna & potatoes au gratin. The tuna was too well done it turned out too dry it broke apart every time I tried to pick it up with my fork. The wasabi sauce along the side was SCARY. They put so much I was literally scared to go back for another bite. It was painful. The waiter that brought out my dish may have noticed they had put too much sauce because before I even tasted it, he asked if I wanted him to re-plate it since the sauce was too much... After I tasted it, I obliged. The au gratin was good, my husband ended up eating that with his steak instead of the Sahara mashed potatoes.Dessert:They brought out a complimentary cheesecake with strawberries & a sauce on top. It was divine. Additional:Because we were there for a special occasion (my birthday) our waiter Alex took our picture and at the end of our meal they presented us with a printed copy of our picture in a frame that all the staff had signed. It was really nice. Overall we were super satisfied with the food and service, we'll definitely be back to celebrate more special dinners at Sullivan's."
2015-07-25,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",O’Malley’s Pub & Restaurant,"Great atmosphere and staff! Very friendly and attentive. The shepherds pie is really good and the portion size with a side salad is perfect. The bangers and mash were really great, also. I highly recommend the Elvis desert. We will plan our next visit later in the evening for drinks and entertainment."
2015-07-25,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Clockwork,"I love this place--It has such a nice vibe. The decor is nice and the drinks are amazing. Depending on the night and DJ the tunes appeal to all age ranges. Whenever we want to hang out and just chill this is the place.The music isn't blaring so you can have a conversation which makes it even better if you're on a date. They serve food but I haven't tried it yet, when I do I will update this review."
2015-07-25,4.0,"Apex, NC",Bolt Bistro,"I have been to Bolt twice, both times the service was terrible, in addition to being slow there seemed to be a lot of confusion.  This time we waited for our server to come to the table and when no one did we finally asked someone ( I think it was a manager) who our server was and he didn't seem to know but took our drink order. Eventually a server came over and it was just awkward, she seemed out of sorts.  The restaurant was not busy at all so I do not think the lack of service was due to being busy.  The server disappeared for long periods of time and never really checked in.  My husband's steak was overdone, he just ended up eating it because it took forever for her to come back.  I will say the service at the bar was great but from the point we were seated it was just a disappointment."
2015-07-25,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bolt Bistro,"I first saw bolt coming up when I was interning at Susan G. Komen dt but I thought it would be pricey and shmancy so my poor college butt never thought about coming to bolt! Thankfully, I am employed after graduation and get to enjoy many dt food gems! Bolt's service is great! At first I was a little weary because the hostess left us awkwardly hanging at the front for a good time until I flagged down a waiter. After that though, everything was smooth sailing! Our waitress was sweet and everything we got was served on a separate plate, the lemon for our waters, napkins and straws, and even an extra order of ketchup! They must have an amazing dishwasher!! Now for the food, sweet potato fries are as good as anywhere. I love that they are waffle fries! But the difference that I saw at bolt was that they served the fries with a sweet cinnamon sauce. I got the Wolfpack burger without bacon and changed the beef patty to a grilled chicken. It was delicious! The brioche bun truly made the burger but I sadly did not taste much pimento as I was really looking forward to it. We also got a free dessert and made the right choice of chocolate chip bread pudding topped with a bourbon glaze! It was delicious to say the least! I will definitely be coming back to bolt some time!"
2015-07-25,5.0,"Fuquay Varina, NC",Hayes Barton Café & Dessertery,"This is my husband and I's favorite restaurant in Raleigh. We go probably once a month for dinner and more often for dessert. Our favorite items include the crab dip and mussels for appetizers, one of the yummy salads or a nightly special for entree and a of course the cake for dessert. We have tried many flavors of cake and our favorites are the lemon blueberry, the peanut butter pie and the italian cream cake. They have a great atmosphere and the food and service have always been great - and we have been many times! I would recommend that you make a reservation or put your name on the list and head across the street to have a glass of wine while waiting - as there isnt much room to wait in the restaurant. There is usually a 30-60 minute wait during dinner hours. It's definitely worth the wait!"
2015-07-25,1.0,"Cary, NC",Chubby’s Tacos,I moved here from Southern California last year and this is by far the best Mexican Food in the Triangle for the price. Friendly fast service.
2015-07-26,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Manhattan Cafe,There's nothing like walking in and being welcomed by your name. The customer services is always on point. Food always excellent! Definitely recommend anyone who's in the downtown area to swing by.
2015-07-26,5.0,"Morrisville, NC",Taza Grill,Have only been one time but will definitely be returning. The service was awesome. Everybody there was super friendly. Even walked me through the menu and made suggestions. I tried the lamb gyro which was great. I've had lamb at other places and it was wayyy to gamey compared to theirs. Looking forward to returning again.
2015-07-26,1.0,"Wake Forest, NC",Midtown Grille,"Hmmm. I love the atmosphere here, and I live in north hills so it's convenient. I go a couple of times a month. The food is good, not remarkable, but over priced.The big beef I have with Midtown happened a couple of weeks ago.I wanted a glass of red wine and asked the bartender to recommend something. He did. It was very, very tasty. When I received the bill, the glass was $18.00. That's right. $18.00.I would have appreciated him making some kind of warning statement, like ""it's wonderful, but it's a little pricey"". It's obviously not my ""neighborhood"" bar, since our relationship is strictly one-sided"
2015-07-26,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Poppyseed Market,"I've tried Poppyseed Market four times. The atmosphere is nice and the staff is friendly.  Orders can sometimes take a while, even for carryout.  Where they miss the mark is on flavor. There is none or it's salt. I recently ordered the special which was fried chicken finger(s) BLT wrap. The chicken piece was not cut so it was a big chunk of chicken in the middle of the wrap and thickly cut tomato.  Would have been much  better evenly disturbed and cut thinner. The chicken had no flavor what so ever. Most plates (that I've received) come with their homemade chips and a side cup of Ranch. Which is nice, but for the almost $12 price tag, I will go elsewhere."
2015-07-26,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",J Betski’s,"We visited J. Betski's for our second time last night. The food was absolutely delicious, as it was the first time. But I'm writing my review because of something else I think is worth sharing. It was a very busy Saturday evening and we didn't have a reservation so we sat at the bar. Our appetizers came very quickly, but our entrées took well over an hour. The bartender could clearly tell that I was getting impatient and restless, and my wife and I were prepared to leave if our meals didn't arrive within the next 10 minutes. Sure enough they did, and we were very satisfied. Exceptional. When it came time to get the bill, the bartender handed us a piece of paper that simply said, ""Please don't hate us. This one's on us."" So, totally free (we gave the bartender a generous tip). I just wanted to share this because that's a very classy move on their part. They could've easily waived the tab on the drinks, or the appetizers, or one of the entrées but instead they opted to waive the entire bill. Very classy move, very generous. And as such, we will be back. Thank you, J. Betski's."
2015-07-26,4.0,"Keller, TX",Backyard Bistro,"Thank you Jennifer for great service and thoughtful words. Food was good too. Had the Italian Sausage and the blue cheese chips, yumTexas sisters.."
2015-07-26,4.0,"Greensboro, NC",J Betski’s,"We picked this restaurant on a whim and were extremely pleased. Out server was attentive but not overbearing and had a thorough knowledge of the food. The menu was not extensive but was supplemented by some intriguing specials. I had the chicken stew, which was delicious and my companion had the schnitzel which was also very good. We shared an appetizer sampler that consisted of two pierogies and a fois gras kielbasa, both excellent. Growing up in a polish family, I found the food to be traditional enough to be recognizable but still with interesting twists that made the experience ce delightful. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."
2015-07-26,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sawasdee Thai Restaurant,Got takeout-- the chicken drunken noodle.  It was delicious!
2015-07-26,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",State of Beer,Absolutely awesome! 12 draft beers and countless in bottles. Really great sandwiches. Each one made from scratch. It's a very chill spot if you want to avoid downtown when it's really crazy. Nice out door patio. Perfect for an afternoon beer. Definitely check it out.
2015-07-26,3.0,"Henderson, NC",Red Pepper Asian,What a great little place!  Local and not a chain- the best Thai food I've had. Service was fast- the chef prepared the meals very quickly. The food was full of flavor and very authentic. My wife had the pad Thai chicken and I had the curry chicken. Very clean and nice decor. Definitely a place I will visit again.
2015-07-26,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Plates Neighborhood Kitchen,"My friend and I recently met for dinner at Plates to celebrate our birthdays which are one week apart. It was a really great choice for dinner!The restaurant is small and cozy inside with a cool outdoor patio which will be especially nice when the weather gets a little cooler.We started out by ordering wine as well as the tapas peppers which came highly recommended by our server. We both liked the peppers which were from Raleigh City Farms and nicely salted. It was a nice size portion for the price.For my entree I ordered the burger deluxe and my friend ordered the grouper. The burger was served open-faced and it was cooked perfectly. It was topped with gruyere, short ribs, tomatoes and truffle mayo. The flavors fit together perfectly. The salad that came on the side was also very good and definitely fresh. My friend enjoyed her grouper as well.Since we were celebrating birthdays they brought us a complimentary scoop of Nutella ice cream- yum! It was a nice ending to an awesome meal.I will definitely be back to Plates, it seems like a nice restaurant for a date night! Overall this was a great experience!"
2015-07-26,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Mecca Restaurant,I read the reviews before coming here so i thought it would be good but i went for lunch & my table got the cheeseburger & spaghetti. Cheeseburger was below average and i could've made the spaghetti better myself. The seats and indoor decor was old & dated. waitress wasnt bad tho. ive seen reviews saying fried chicken was good but i will not be back to try it.

2015-07-26,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Plates Neighborhood Kitchen,Been interested in trying this place and went on a Saturday night. Loved the ambiance and not too crowded. Started with one of their cocktails- their version of a margarita with blackberry. It was so good!The menu is small and doesn't have a ton of options but the entrees looked good especially the pork chop and short rib. Unfortunately we wanted something light and the only option was a salad. They couldn't add meat to it when we requested. Apparently they don't serve chicken at all. I have to say though the salad was simple but delicious. We also tried poblano peppers which were simply sautéed with salt. A must-try if you go - absolutely amazing! I also liked the crab and sweet potato beignets. Overall very good food but limited options for dinner. Am interested to try their brunch sometime too.

2015-07-27,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Flights Restaurant & Lounge,"I visited Flights with a friend last Friday evening.  We'd been to the restaurant before, and as in our prior visits, the service was delightful -- even engaging,  The space is open, uncrowded, and the sound level is conducive to conversation.  Its a good place for those who love food and want to share that passions with others.  For cocktails, we remembered a drink that had been on the menu at one of our earlier visits, ""The Winkle.""  Although it was no longer on the cocktail menu, one of the bar tenders took time to look back into Flight's recipe file to find the mysterious concoction, even though we had ordered another cocktail.  Certainly, we didn't expect  servers and the bar staff go to such lengths, departing from their current offerings,  but their efforts were a reminder of our prior service experiences at Flights, which was one of the reasons that we had chosen to come back that evening.   Now, let's talk about food.....The Chef presented us with a complimentary amuse bouche when the drinks arrived  -- crostini with prosciutto and cantaloupe. (We had a wonderful complimentary gazpacho at a prior visit.)  When asked, our server recommended the kale salad with mandarin orange segments, pistachio nuts, and yogurt dressing.  I ordered it because I know we are supposed to be eating kale, and since I was planning to have dessert, I thought I should do something that was ""responsible"" and ""adult.""  I was pleasantly surprised to find that I truly enjoyed the salad, and I consider the mark of true enjoyment to be whether someone would order a dish again.  Yes -- definitely, I would order it again.  The kale was more tender than kale that I can purchase, the leaves much smaller, and the blend with the sweetness of the oranges, and the crunch of the pistachios made a most pleasant salad. For the entre, I had scallops and green pea risotto -- a delightful dish, delightfully prepared.  Dessert was toasted coconut cake with salted  caramel drizzle.  Later in the evening, Chef Anthony came into the dining room to speak with guests at their tables.  Our questions about his culinary background quickly lead to his warm recollections of the importance of family meals in his growing-up years, and how important is was  -- and still is -- to celebrate life, friends, and family with lovely food and pleasant times. We'll surely be planning to go back again."
2015-07-27,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Red Pepper Asian,"For a while after moving to north east raleigh my fiancé and I frequented a different Chinese takeout place, mostly because it's cheaper. But the old adage, you get what you pay for, is definitely true. We eventually switched over to Red Pepper for our takeout needs and we won't be going back to the old place. They have many more vegetarian options than many similar restaurants, the crispy eggplant, sesame tofu, and curry tofu being our favorites. They are a little stingy with the soy sauce and duck sauce, so ask for extra if that's important to you. It's close to our house, the prices are reasonable, and the food is always ready within 15-20 minutes after ordering. We'll keep coming back."

With that being said the 'Flaming Pu Pu platter' was a slight disappointment, luckily the entrées of 'Curry Beef' and 'General Tso's' kitchen were awesome. The entire stay was great also, the live piano player really made it feel like a special occasion, and while the staff may have been a tad spread thin there were extremely nice and attentive."

Note: you may want to call for a reservation. They didn't have an empty table when we showed up at 11:40am, so we sat at the bar (so glad we did though!) I got the hangover sandwich ($9) and he got the skillet ($10), both of our meals were delicious, and honestly I would have spent more for them. Mimosas were on special, I got a grapefruit mimosa ($4!!) - it wasn't like any mimosa I had ever had, the juice was fresh and the bartender torched the grapefruit peel for garnish, it was awesome. My husband got a bourbon flight - our bartender, who was SO fantastic, was able to tell us about every bourbon on the shelf in detail; she really knew her stuff. All the bourbons she picked for our flight were amazing - we really ended up loving the Angel's Envy Rye!Seriously can't wait to go back, wanting to check out the dinner service!"

That being said, I didn't really think that the dogs lived up to the promising descriptions and catchy names. Don't get me wrong, they're good, but I can only assume that they can be better. The fries are excellent, and the beer is local, so it's an overall win for me."

2015-07-28,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",MoJoe’s Burger Joint,"MoJoe's is a staple restaurant of Glenwood South so I can't believe I waited so long to try it.  We had our sights set on another place closeby, but alas we were all starving and couldn't stand the long wait.  MoJoe's had ample seating, plenty of wait staff and the cozy feeling of a small diner so we came here instead.  It was a great decision as we all thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  We chose to sit inside as it was hot and drizzling a bit outside.  Several members of the waitstaff stopped by immediately to address any questions we had, take our drink orders and ask if we were generally alright.  I am a sucker for great, attentive service so this place scored amazingly well in that category for me.  I created my own burger with wheat bun, pepper jack cheese, fried egg, lettuce, tomato and a single patty with a side order of cheese fries.  I was a little disappointed that they didn't ask how I wanted the burger cooked (always weary when they have to cook the meat to medium or higher), but figured I would just wait and see.  We were a table of 4 and our food came out relatively quick (yay more brownie points for MoJoe's) and hot!  I took one bite of my fries, and did not stop eating until I had finished all of them.  I love that they drizzled the cheese all over the top of the fries, and it was the melted shredded or slices of cheese.  I finally started on the burger and it was a little overcooked for my liking, but the lettuce and tomato was fresh and my fried egg was perfect so, it's hard to complain about a meal I enjoyed!I want to take advantage of their after 10 PM burger special someday so it is definitely on my to-return list!"

Although it seems like it would be stuffy, the servers and chef have always been nice and the portions for tapas are generous and well priced.Must haves are the truffle mac & cheese and the corn on the cob with miso butter sauce! Love them so much!My only complaint is the dessert options...although they are not bad, they pale in comparison to the rest of the menu. But we are usually so full from dinner that we can't eat dessert anyway!"

2015-07-28,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Monapita Mediterranean Grill,"This place has been tucked back there for 15 months and while I have seen it many times before, I never stopped by. Big mistake. They are wonderfully friendly owners and the hospitality they offer goes above and beyond what is required. Now, in North Raleigh, there are plenty of Mediterranean eateries. In fact, nearby there are Iraqi, Jordanian, Lebanese, Greek, and Egyptian spots (or owners). Each culture has a slightly different approach to a somewhat similar American palate-friendly menu. This place, owned by Syrians, nails the falafel better than any other joint I've been to in the area. So, I ordered the falafel side along with my standard lamb gyro or chicken pita, and couldn't have been happier. Great place and looking forward to going again."
2015-07-28,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",O’Malley’s Pub & Restaurant,"I am a big fan of this Irish pub! The food is economical and GOOD!! In the past I have enjoyed their fish and chips, shepard's pie, some type of roast beef sandwich goodness, house salad, fries, and chicken wings. There are so many other items, particularly sandwiches, which my friends rave about but I have yet to have the pleasure of eating. A thumbs up to the ambiance inside. Cozy wooden booths, unique hanging lamps, and very Irish feeling. The staff are great. Aaaand this is a perfect place to order Guiness on draught & they also have Smithwicks in bottles (and a Tuesday beer special). O'Malley's is one of my go-to spots. Good stuff!"
2015-07-28,5.0,"Hamburg, NJ",Cameron Bar and Grill,"I ate there last night for an engagement party. The menu was unique and diverse. The presentation was on point and everything was super delectable. Even the service was superior. I had a strawberry spinach salad with crumbled goat cheese, red onions and a homemade strawberry vinaigrette. The chef came out to chat with a few customers at some point and he talked about his Farm 2 Table initiative to increase the use of local, organic produce. It was obvious how fresh all the food was.  Even my Mom's blueberry Creme Brûlée was lick-the-spoon worthy. I'll be coming back."

Most meats are cooked over the traditional Firebird wood fired grill. Everything smells woodsy with a smoke pit quality that is quite pleasant. Too early for most diners so service was a bit lackadaisical (the manager brought our meals to us) but not irritatingly slow. We both enjoyed the smoky taste of the meats and the fries were crispy hot. Homemade breads were an added bonus.

2015-07-29,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sullivan’s Steakhouse,"This place definitely meets the high expectation standard. I've dined at Sullivan's all over the country but this location is by far my favorite. I dined here last week with a colleague and we arrived around 5pm without reservations. I always make reservations however this was a last minute decision to eat dinner here over having cocktails.When you walk in you're greeted. There hasn't been any instance where I wasn't greeted. Since we didn't have a reservation the hostess informed us that it would only be a few minutes wait. A few minutes later we were seated in the main dining area towards the center of the room.I ordered the Moscow mule cocktail and a Malbec with dinner. Sullivans has an extensive wine list and my colleague was able to find a wine he loves from Washington state. I noticed they were advertising the prix fixe in the menu so I choose that. The prix fixe was a three course meal with an appetizer, salad, and entree. I choose the calamari, house salad, and grilled salmon. Everything was delicious and well cooked.The best part about this visit is the desert. The bananas foster is to die for! That is one of my favorite desserts and there are only a few places that does it well...Sullivan's is one of them.This is a great place for a date or group. The service is always excellent and the food is amazing. I also received a nice handwritten thank you note from Megan and Jim today thanking me for dining there. Now that's class :-)"

Beneath all that new look still beats the heart of Mami Nora, so I'm not going to tell you anything about Alpaca you don't already know.Call it barbecue chicken, call it rotisserie chicken, call it whatever you want, but just know it is still just as delicious. I think my appetite just upgraded from half chicken to a whole chicken...Arroz Chaufa is really just fried rice, but delicious fried rice, with chicken and sausage. I recommend putting some of that 'green sauce' on top of it.The saltado platter (your choice of sauteed steak/lomo or chicken/pollo) with tomatoes, onion, fries (yes, fries!) with a side of rice, is very filling.Whatever you get, just make sure you also get a freshly made horchata with your meal."

My friend and I each got a beer on tap and a sandwich. I got the Brie sandwich, which was amazing with the chickpea side, which was also quite tasty! Everyone that was working there seemed genuinely interested in how our beer and food was, which I really appreciated. I wanted to take some local beer home to my husband and they were able to suggest one that he ended up really enjoying. I loved the chill atmosphere as well as the fact there was both inside and outside seating - will definitely be back!"

2015-07-29,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mami Nora’s,"I had never had Peruvian food before. I have to say I was impressed. This place is known for their rotisserie chicken. Since that was the case, I ordered that with black beans and hand cut fries. I also drank horchatta, I have had better. The half chicken I ordered was moist and quite tasty. It was served with a yellow sauce and a green sauce. The yellow sauce is sweet and the green sauce is quite spicy so proceed with caution. The fries were also delicious. I tried the black beans and I did not feel that they were anything overly special. I felt like I could have made those at home. The environment is a little sparse. There are not napkins on the table, you have to go get them. They give you your silver ware at the counter. There are plenty of tv's. The tables and booths are kind of hard when you sit on them. This is kind of a no frills environment. I think that if there is a next time, I will order it take out and with a different side than black beans."

My husband and I ended up both getting drinks, appetizers, an entrée, and sharing a dessert - which is WAY more food than we usually good, but it was just way too hard to pare down our choices! To drink I got the sangria, which was good - not great and my husband got the Garden's Bounty which was absolutely amazing! For appetizers we got the peach and mozzarella salad and the halloumi cheese salad, both of which were so fresh and had great flavors. For our entrees I got the striped bass, which was good, but the veggies underneath really stole the dish as they were phenomenal. My husband got the signature chicken and waffles which were melt in your mouth good and apparently a menu staple. For dessert we got the chocolate soufflé which was the perfect end to an amazing dinner - they bring it out right from the oven and pour in the hot fudge and add the crème fresh right at your table. We will definitely be back especially since the menu is always changing based on what is fresh - so there will always be new choices!"

A colleague was staying at a nearby hotel and in an effort to escape the usual fare there we drove up to Wade Park. The breakfast menu is very basic -- some egg sandwiches/croissants/bagels and pastries, mostly. The friendly staff were very accommodating for my friend's vegetarianism and swapped bacon for avocado.

2015-07-30,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tijuana Flats,"I give T.F. the Whole Five Stars...and for a reason... they GET it. They understand the ENTIRE concept of of serving quality food at affordable prices from a staff that is over accommodating, hip and sexy. I usually stay away around lunch time for ""Taco Tuesday"" or ""Burrito Thursday"" because I don't want to wait in line to save a buck... but if that's for you, go for it. The selection of house-created hot sauces will never disappoint."
2015-07-30,3.0,"Apex, NC",Humble Pie,"My husband and I had dinner here a few nights ago. We enjoyed our dinner in the outdoor seating area and were pleasantly welcomed. There's a lot of hustle and bustle on the patio and there's a little confusion as to who is ur server but it's convenient that a waiter is not hard to flag down. We had a quick overview of the menu earlier in the day and had our heart set on trying the avocado & pie ""hummus"" & the crab dish. Unfortunately the crab was sold out by the time we for there & the avocado hummus was one of the few things my husband really enjoyed. We decided to try the fried chicken which I found to be a very unique spin on classic fried chicken. I loved that it was boneless and the flavored were very original. I also took an order of the gnocchi home after sharing a plate of the cornmeal fried shrimp which both dishes sounded better than they tasted. We decided to opt out on dessert orders and we were a little disgusted with the helps constant petting of the dogs on the patio while rushing back and forth from kitchen to table with plates of food. The food was okay, nothing I would return for & the servers' pet habits had me questioning their sanitation rating."

2015-07-30,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bahama Breeze,"The food was mediocre (I ordered the much talked-about coconut shrimp entree and was not bowled over by it). Much worse was the service - there was very little said by the way of recommendations; we had to wait to get cutlery after our food arrived, then wait again for condiments when we asked for them midway. Towards the end of the meal, we asked to be seated inside since it was a warm night and it was getting very humid on the patio, but were told that we would have to see the host, since it was a busy night. When we did that, the host told us that there was a waiting of 10-15 minutes to get a table. There was no one (not even one person) waiting to be seated, and quite a few empty tables right in front of us without a ""reserved"" sign on them. It was clear they were not going to offer us a table anytime soon, so we offered to pay and leave, but they said the machines were down so we would have to wait, offering us no place to sit in the meanwhile (the bar was full). I have never felt more unwelcome anywhere as a paying customer. Will never ever go back again."
2015-07-31,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Pearl Chinese Restaurant,"Not going to lie if it  wasn't for the Yelp reviews I would have never given this place a try. Super excited to have some yummy Chinese takeout close to home. The menu and portions are huge!I took Heather M's suggestion and ordered the Singapore noodles, very good and like I mentioned a huge portion. The flavors were spot on and tasted even better the next day cold. Also decided on some good old fashion Kung Pao chicken, it's one of my favorite Chinese dishes and it took care of my craving. With all the other options though I'm not sure I'd order the Kung Pao again. So if you are looking for your traditional Americanized Chinese food feel free to order they have it and the combo meals. But if you are looking to experiment and try some of their signature dishes I think you should take the risk.They also had an entire new menu board with noodles and soups, sounded a little like ramen but they weren't calling it that.They did have some bangin' wonton/egg drop mixed soup that I would definitely order again. The place is a dive with plenty of seats to dine in, and take out took no time at all. They have a turtle pond, not going to lie it's a little strange and some claw crane games including one with some electronic devices. The decor is a little weird but don't miss out on all this yummy food. Good eats for cheap, I'm all in!!"

2015-07-31,5.0,"Worcester, MA",MachuPicchu Peruvian Cuisine,"My husband and I went here for lunch while on vacation.  We were greeted by a very friendly waiter and seated immediately. Having never had Peruvian food before we were inquisitive about the menu. The waiter was knowledgable about the ingredients taste and portion size. We ordered the ceviche sampler, and the appetizer sampler. We were going to order the tacu tacu also but he suggested we may want to hold off as that portions were large! He was right. The ceviche was interesting, three types and all were extremely fresh. The shrimp were huge and the fish was portioned well.  The sampler of six items was a good taste of different types of Peruvian food. It was extremely flavorful. I don't know what it should have tasted like as I've never experienced authentic Peruvian food, but we were not disappointed. If we lived closer we would frequent this place but it deserves a chance and a was a great place to explore Peruvian food. My only comment would be to lessen up on the onions they are abundant on everything. Sadly we were too full for dessert, but the service and food were fabulous!"
2015-07-31,4.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",MachuPicchu Peruvian Cuisine,"Ate dinner at this restaurant last night for the first time in several years. Have tried to eat here twice in the past, once turned down because we had too many people (understandable; very small place) and another time because it was after 8:30 and they close at 9. Other Yelper's have mentioned their vague policy about not seating people close to closing time. The food was actually very good. Over priced but good. Portions of what we ordered weren't bad either. What was bad was the owner/chef. Our waitress brought me a Presidente Pilsner (Dominican Republic) which I sipped a few times and immediately noticed it was flat. I told her if that was the way that beer was (it's not, it was a Pilsner), let me know and I would keep it and if not to bring me a Corona. The owner/chef came out and said that he'd taken the beer off my check, that they keep their beer really cold, it only seems flat, and that if I ordered any other beer, it would be the same way. I said, ""So because you keep your beer really cold it goes flat?"" He stated it was not flat and with an insulting tone repeated what he'd just said. We had our food packed up and left 5-8 minutes after receiving our food.  I'm not sure what kind of idiot the owner takes his diners for, but cold beer doesn't seem flat. Especially not a Pilsner. My theory is they accidentally froze all their beer one or more times and he's still trying to squeeze money out of it. Don't go here if you'd like to drink beer, cocktails under $10, or if you'd like to eat food that wasn't prepared by an a-hole."

Later, the sides for our entrees were also excellent, but my scallops were burnt (I don't mean blackened) on one side and my date's fish was wholly overcooked.In general, the service was good, but I missed the tablecloth that should come with $25-$35 entrees -- after clearing our appetizer, the waiter placed new silverware directly onto the wood table.With a Groupon discount, I was merely disappointed at the value; I cannot imagine returning for a full fare meal."

2015-08-01,3.0,"Midland, TX",Abyssinia Ethiopian Restaurant,My wife and I came here for a late lunch. There wasn't a whole lot of people and the restaurant.

2015-08-01,2.0,"Arlington, MA",Red Pepper Asian,"I'm disappointed in this place after my second visit. First visit, at lunchtime, I had Kung Pao chicken. I asked for it extra-spicy and it was good. Standard American Chinese version with a little extra spice. But my wife wasn't blown away by her dish at that meal. Last night, visited again and was excited about trying more of their menu. My take: Fried Calamari appetizer: good, but kind of bland. Easy to overpower with soy sauce or duck sauce, too... with just the right dash of seasoning, it was very good, but it was very bland the way it came out of the kitchen. Fried dumplings: OK. Again, very bland. They get points for not using a super-thick wrapper, but lose points for the lack of distinctive flavor. Finally, I ordered off the ""traditional"" menu (or whatever they call it) for my entree, and was very disappointed. I got the beef with chilies, and it was just a mess. Way too many scallions, IMO, and the scallions, onions and peppers were diced into ridiculously small pieces. With all these different flavors, the dish still didn't have any predominating flavor and it just tasted like a bunch of stuff thrown together. I liked it less and less as the meal progressed, and neither finished it nor took home the leftovers (this is, I should mention, completely unprecedented for me when it comes to Chinese food). Maybe I need to try the Malaysian or Thai food, but I honestly don't know how soon I'll be back here. My quest for good Chinese food on the East/Southeast side of Raleigh will, unfortunately, have to continue..."

The staff is courteous and you will never feel rushed.I have gone back there a multiple times and not been disappointed."
2015-08-02,3.0,"Ann Arbor, MI",O’Malley’s Pub & Restaurant,"This is solely based on my experience of having lunch there (because there is no other food place around the famous ice cream place near by) . Pretty poor service. The lady that initially served us water just left for the day after that and no one else bothered to check with us till at least 15 mins later. Beer selection is pretty standard. No local stuff. Food is meh. Stale chips, sub standard sandwiches and pizza. Only decent part was the ambiance."
2015-08-02,2.0,"Holly Springs, NC",The Rockford,"I have been to The Rockford a few times now and love it. I traveled up the steps and was greeted by one of my favorite staff members there, Marcus! We were able to sit outside on this beautiful day, I did not know that this option was available probably because it is a smaller space that contains only 2 tables. Unfortunately this time wasn't as great as the others. I would recommend to steer clear of the wine, the Malbec didn't taste like much of anything and my glass looked a bit dirty. Next time I will stick with beer. I got the Istanbul which was good but the turkey tasted a bit dry. My boyfriend got the Mafia Chicken and really enjoyed it. We paid a little bit extra to get sides with our meals, the brussel sprouts and fried broccoli are always solid choices. I do recommend that you check this place out!"
2015-08-02,4.0,"Ewa Beach, HI",Kabab and Curry,"We came here because of groupon but I will absolutely come back over and over again. The incredible aroma when you walk in is just a glimpse of how amazing the food is.  I usually get palak paneer as my one comparison dish and something else (we chose lamb vindaloo today). The paneer was so flavorful and the lamb was so tender. Like I said, new favorite! Come here."
2015-08-02,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kabab and Curry,"The title of this review could be ""room for improvement"". Or it could be ""what a ripoff."" Or it could be ""only does so well because it's right next to NC State."" I've been to Kabab and Curry's buffet a number of times, and have found it wanting. I don't think I'd go back more than once, except it's walking distance from my home. Alright, let's start with some positives: -They bring out a basket of fresh Naan to each table. And onto the negatives: -The first time we went there, both of the bathrooms were out of commission. So if someone came in with dirty hands, and wanted to wash them - tough. That's gross, and just a recipe for  spreading nasty stomach virus type illness. Also, (and sorry to be uncouth) Indian food is known to cause bowel evacuation for people not used to the spices.... Heaven forbid if someone's bowel's exploded while not being admitted to the bathroom. -3 of the 4 times I went the food on the buffet was just really dry. Dried out/mummified/dehydrated Tandoori chicken is not desirable. Rock hard dried rice is a great way to crack a tooth. It begs the question how long has this food been out on the buffet? -My picky vegetarian wife hated the place. There weren't many veggy friendly items, and the ones that they did have were seemingly just random and thrown together, like Kidney beans with mushrooms (I don't even think they bothered to put up a name tag for it). She has the suspicion that they just serve leftovers on the  buffet. -The price. They charge the same as Sitar. You know, Sitar, the best Indian restaurant in the Triangle. For shame that this dinghy hole in the wall would be so audacious to charge as much as the king of Indian food in Raleigh-Durham. $12 buffet. And the food is bad. No thanks. -Service barely existent, and the servers seem like grumps. For a buffet I require one thing: fill my damn water. If you're not going to do that, and you're going to treat my business like it's  unwelcome, then maybe you need to find another job. -Ambiance: Cramped, and dark. Due to the NC State proximity they are usually busy, and there isn't a lot of personal space here. -Absolute lack of surprise: If you go to any buffet there are some items that are usually there (tandoori chicken, chicken tikki masala, Saag Paneer, Daal). But most places will have one or two items that are a nice surprise, like Novratan Korma, or Lamb Rogan Josh. There's nothing like that to be found at Kabob and Curry. Just the basics, unless you include the random mish-mash of crap they throw together as a vegetarian plate.My recommendation is to do one of the following: drive out to Sitar and get a great buffet for the same price, or if you don't want to go that far, go to one of the places out on Capital Boulevard (i.e. Royal Indian or Sia) that are about the same price but much tastier. Or, you could even go out to the Cary Indian places that are much more authentic (especially Udupi)"
2015-08-02,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Capital Club 16,"I love this place.  We've been going there for brunch after church every week for months now.  It is bright, sunny, and cheerful.  The staff is great.  The bar comes from the old luchow's restaurant in Manhattan and the chairs are from an old Manhattan automat.The customers are a great mix of ages and types and everyone has a good time.  Food at brunch is good with several German themed dishes.  Specials change each week if you want something new.  The food tends to be a little on the heavy side and everything comes with a side of potatoes.  If it seems to heavy, try asking for the dish without the potatoes.  The dinner menu is very similar to the brunch menu, which was a bit of a surprise.  It's best to try it in the winter when they offer goose and game specials.  Great bar with lots of good beer options."
2015-08-02,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chubby’s Tacos,"Giving a 1 star review based on the terrible customer service we experienced today. We tried to order a kids item off the menu and Chloe refused. The member of our party explained that, due to a jaw injury, she was unable to eat much which is why she was ordering the smaller portion. Chloe still refused to allow the order. When we complained and expressed how disappointed we were in her response, she simply walked away, leaving the other employee to complete our order. We asked to speak with the owner, but he was not on site. We asked to speak with the manager, and were told it was Chloe (who refused to talk to us). We asked for the owner's name and number, but they would only give us his name. At this point, our party of five decided to take our business elsewhere.We've been coming to Chubby's for over 5 years but, after how we were treated today, will no longer be a patron."

2015-08-02,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mandolin,"We went to Mandolin last night for dinner.  This was the second time we've eaten there.  The food was good and they have an interesting menu.  I had the charcuterie for the appetizer.  It was a nice assortment of pickled things and cured meats.  My favorite part was the pickled tongue, which was great and something you normally don't find.  The bistro steak with braised fennel was very good and the buttermilk pie was also great and again, not something you find at a lot of restaurants.  The pie had a nice lemon flavor and was made with a tart crust rather than the standard pie crust, which was a nice variation.  My wife had the barbecued ribs, which were very good.  They provided a hot towel for her fingers, but the meat was falling off the bones so you could eat it with just your fork.My only criticisms would be taking up real estate on the menu with chicken and waffles.  It doesn't really fit the menu and seems like a too often repeated fad.  Also, the bartender didn't seem to know how to make a sazerac.  Service was great, fast and very friendly.  The price was very reasonable for the type of food and restaurant.  Definitely worth it if you want someplace for a special occasion."
2015-08-02,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Plates Neighborhood Kitchen,"Wow!  Rarely am I this impressed by a restaurant.  First, the service: even in Glenwood South, they were ready for us (we had reservations), and ready with a high chair (downtown restaurants often don't or can't accommodate a toddler well).  Everyone was friendly and made us feel very welcomed and wanted.  The waiter explained the specials and answered questions, including mentioning how everything was as fresh and local as possible.  He wasn't kidding.  After we ordered (crab beignets to start, hanger steak and salmon for the two entrees), we saw a chef or sous chef snipping herbs from the garden.  That was reflected in the food.  Everything was perfect.  My only regret was being too full for dessert."
2015-08-02,5.0,"Hamburg, NJ",Firebirds Wood Fired Grill,"Lobster and spinach queso is very good.  My wife had a salad with shrimp.  I had the 7 oz blue cheese fillet medium rare.  It was more on the rare side, but very good.  The blue cheese and mushrooms were very tasty.  I also has a Duckhorn cab.  When ordering by the glass I need to remember to ask how long the bottle has been open.  It had been open for a few hours.  Good, but not great.  My wife had a blood orange margarita and she loved it.  Go early, it gets crowded."

2015-08-02,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sawasdee Thai Restaurant & Bar,Last time I came to eat we were seated after waiting for several minutes at the door. Then once we were seated we sat at our table for 15 minutes without any waiter coming to greet us. Yet there were only two other tables in the restaurant. There were more waiters then patrons and yet we did not receive any service. I will not be coming back to this restaurant
2015-08-02,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chopstix Gourmet and Sushi Bar,"I'm going to go ahead and update to 5 stars for now. I got take out last night (this would be the 2nd time getting food here) and I have absolutely no complaints.Online ordering: The site said they only deliver within five miles so we decided to get take out rather than find a different place. One important thing to note when placing an online order here (which may be the solution to previous reviews complaining of orders not being received) is that when you pick out your foodstuffs and THEN try to create an account afterwards, it will not automatically go through with your order. You must go back to the site and complete your order. You will know when it works when it states that it is processing and then a confirmation. I hope this helps.Packing: We had a larger order this time: a quart of hot and sour soup, a quart of wonton soup, a Singapore mei fun (no carrots), a general tso chicken, a moo shu chicken, and a mongolian beef. Everything was packed well in a small cardboard box with flaps of cardboard separating the dishes. There was only minor leakage from one entrée (just the lid being not seated all the way) that did get on the sauce packets but it never seeped through the cardboard. We received many packets of soy and duck sauce and a number of fortune cookies. The moo shu pancakes were wrapped in foil and there were three small bags of fried noodles for the soup.Service: We received a phone call when the order was ready. I believe more to check to see if we were on our way since we weren't there yet rather than standard procedure. Not sure. The lady was pleasant and very helpful when we got our food. She let us know that they recently changed their delivery restrictions to be more convenient: they now deliver to any place within a 15 minute driveShe also said if the site does not let you order even if you are within that area, just change the zip code to the same one as the restaurant and it will go through. So basically unless you do not live within city limits, they should probably be able to get to you. Yay for Chinese/sushi delivery!Food: Everything was fantastic. Good flavor, still warm, everything prepped correctly. Nothing I can really nit-pick about. My beloved moo shu was actual moo shu and not that horrible blasphemy that is the weird coleslaw concoction that some restaurants do. They use tortillas for the pancakes (my parents' restaurants did this so I'm more accustomed to this version) rather than the thin rice wrappers that some places offer which is wonderful since I do not have to worry about rippage or leakage.The hot and sour soup was super tasty like last time and while I did not have a chance to try the other foodstuffs, everyone else said their dishes were great.So again, no complaints. Everything went very well and I can look forward to delivery next time. Sweet."
2015-08-03,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Pearl Chinese Restaurant,"I love Pearl Restaurant because their price is really reasonable and food is good, too! I've started going here since I was a student at NC State and their lunch special deal($4.99) is awesome! They've got a lot of different menu that you can choose, there are lots of variety, options and I haven't tried all of them, but food that I had so far were good. Sometimes it takes for a while to get your food because there are a lot of people around dinner time. I usually call them and order my food so that I wouldn't have to wait but get my food quickly. Like other people's review, lots of food, so I cannot finish whole dish most of the time. But it still tastes good even after a day or so! My favorite food is chicken garlic sauce with rice! And their big delicious roll is amazing, too! Lots of broccoli, carrots, and other healthy vegetables in that food, and their garlic sauce is SO good. Sesame chicken is really good, too but when I had that last time, their chicken was a little bit hard to chew! But those are my favorites and others are really good, too.I go there often just because it is really close from my place and like I mentioned, their price is so reasonable! Nothing can beat that! I never get tired of eating their food and people who work there are really nice, too!"
2015-08-03,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Abyssinia Ethiopian Restaurant,"I would give this place four stars just for their servers' attention to diners. The lady who served our table both times I went there was gracious and made the entire dining experience very positive. Her recommendations were top-notch and we loved what we ordered. The injera bread is delicious, and the doro wat and the yebeg wat preparations were pretty great. It might be a bit on the spicy side for some diners, but I am Indian and the dishes are very similar to certain Indian chicken and lamb dishes. Overall, a good experience!"

2015-08-03,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gringo A Go-Go,I was excited to try this place but will not be going back. Everything on the menu was extremely overpriced. The biggest downfall is that they charge $5 to bring out chips and salsa and they bring out a tiny bit of both the chips and the salsa. For their prices they can surely afford complimentary chips and salsa like nearly every other Mexican restaurant in town. The food was good but not so good as to off set the high prices.
2015-08-03,5.0,"Durham, NC",Kimbap,"Thanks to Chip R. for recommending Kimbap to me many moons ago, and I finally found my way here! A hidden gem in Seaboard station, located next to BREW, with an open kitchen, small dining space and nice outdoor patio seating. I will admit, I am much more familiar with Southeastern Asian good rather then Northeastern Asian food, but I am always looking for good Korean food [with much more flavor and piazza then Chinese elements]. Kimbap is definitely on the top of my Korean food list, even though it's Korean inspired rather then 100% authentic. And it's not just the delicious flavors of their food, but also their top notch service, cozy and intimate atmosphere AND the fact that you can watch your food being prepared if you sit at the bar [LOVE open kitchens!] that draws me to this restaurant. You start with a complimentary pickled plate [ours included carrots, seaweed and beets; all pickled]. Unfortunately this part wasn't explained, so we weren't sure if we ate it immediately or waited to put it on our food. We split the pork belly lettuce wraps and the Bibimbap mixed rice bowl. Both I would order again and recommend. The pork belly was incredibly tender and all those flavors in the rice bowl mixed together perfectly: sweet, savory, salty, spicy, DELIGHTFUL! Prices are a little high, as I've found with most Korean restaurants in the area, but the portions are large and we were very satisfied after splitting only one appetizer and one entree. I can't wait to return and try ALL of their unique dishes."
2015-08-03,4.0,"Cary, NC",Pho Vietnam,"We decided to try another pho spot, because...pho! Anyhow, I was excited to try this one as it is less of a drive than the other place we've tried since moving here, and the reviews seemed pretty good too. The pho itself is pretty good. There is only the option for large or small, and compared to other spots it's a small or medium size-wise. I personally enjoyed the broth here and my toddler did too. My husband seemed to think it was just okay and preferred others more. The noodles were good too and didn't clump together. I prefer the meatballs to be cut like coins, but they tasted fine here even though they were in wedges. What we didn't really like about the experience was that the service was all over the place. We came in, were seated, then we were pretty much forgotten it seems. We had a long time to look at our menus, too long. Then we ordered, asked for water, and watched as other people were given water and checked on while we were ignored. Finally someone came around with a pitcher and realized we hadn't even received cups for water. I asked for a straw for my daughter and then the staff disappeared AGAIN. Sigh. After waiting a few minutes, I got up to wait for someone to return to the register and asked again for a straw. Oh...and only one of our drinks that we ordered made it to the table at all. I really don't know if they were having a really off day or if this is common practice here. =/ Overall, I want to like this place and we'd probably be regulars...but not with service like this. Guess we'll keep looking in the area for our regular pho spot."

I stumbled upon Cameron bar and grill online and the menu looked good so we went.I have to say I was completely taken back by how delicious the food was! I started off with the agave margarita which was made perfectly- amazing.We got the chicken nachos to share and they were out of this world. Spicy and flavorful, perfect down to the amount of salt on the chips.I got the bacon meatloaf for my meal, and my husband got the southern chicken. Both were awesome! I typically wouldn't order meatloaf at a restaurant but couldn't say no after reading the description! What the best part for us was that the nachos and the southern chicken are gluten free. My husband has a gluten intolerance and finding something that he enjoys and is also GF is hard to come by. Cameron Bar and Grill is definitely a place we will visit again!"
2015-08-04,5.0,"Fuquay-Varina, NC",Oakwood Café,"It's a cute little place tucked in downtown with its own small parking lot, which is nice if you can grab a spot.Service was decent for a lunch crowd during the week and it did get packed inside.  I was a little disappointed with the Argentinean food. I'm basing my comparison to the only experience I've had with Argentinean food, cooked by an Argentinean friend. We ordered the provoleta which tasted ok (my friend makes it with chimichurri sauce on top which is so yummy). It was only served with four small slices of toasted bread along side, hardly enough for the cheese. I ordered the empanada platter with tostones. This was the first time I have ever tried tostones and they had little flavor, almost like unseasoned fries. The pastry of the empanada was really good, fried perfectly. My favorite filling was the spinach and cheese, the chicken had little flavor. My son ordered the Cuban Steak sandwich and it was full of juicy, thinly sliced steak. Overall kind of unimpressive. If I go back, I think I'll sample the Cuban fare."
2015-08-04,2.0,"Charlotte, NC",Bolt Bistro,Went here for a corporate dinner. Service was spectacular and the food was above average. I ordered the stuffed chicken and my friends ordered everything from the lobster mac to the filet. Lobster mac was amazing! Wedge salad looked delicious as well
2015-08-04,5.0,"Durham, NC",Brio Tuscan Grille,"I felt like the menu was overpriced.  My Penne Alla Vodka was quite delicious but $18 for a pasta dish with no meat???  Add a salad, beer, and soda to make a $32 bill for one person...I guess that really isn't too bad but a little rich for my blood.  Service was good.  Everything was good...just not outstanding."
2015-08-04,4.0,"Manhattan, NY",Mandolin,"Farm-to-table at its best in an elegantly modern, yet friendly, environment. We started on the excellent craft cocktail list which features local herbs, juices and seasonal inspiration. The menu is manageable and features only fresh ingredients cooked well and with creativity. Generous portions and low prices, for the quality. Feels like New York dining without the pretentious table neighbors and insane pricing. First time in Raleigh and super impressed."
2015-08-04,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Plates Neighborhood Kitchen,We were hoping for better because the menu looked so appealing. We started off with some house made sodas. They were ok but nothing really special. We both had the crab beignets which were so airy and lacking in substance that they were not satisfying to eat. I had the corn chowder for an entree which was a bit too sweet for my liking. My wife had a Pork chop with mango chutney on a corn sauce. The pork chop was beautiful and the sauces were good but to me the pork chop had no seasoning at all and tasted very bland although my wife did enjoy it. We finished with the house made vanilla ice cream which had a strange texture and was both way too sweet and lacking in all vanilla flavor. All in all the feeling I got was that the food and or menu was designed for interest and not for flavor. They do change the menu every night and maybe that keeps them from being able to fully develop their menu but for me with all the choices around I won't be returning.
2015-08-04,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tasty 8’s,"No complaints here. I went during lunch and put in a to-go order. The blue cheese and chili dog was great, and so were the fries with choice of sauce. The wait was on the longer side, but only because it was so busy and someone in front of me ordered a dozen for the office. I suggest going during a low traffic time as well,  because parking was not a blast. However, pretty decent gourmet hot dog joint."
2015-08-04,1.0,"Durham, NC",Bahama Breeze,"After reading reviews, I expected mediocre food. What I got was nowhere close. It's not like my expectations were high, but frozen seafood and undercooked chicken (with stringy rubber texture) made for a less than enjoyable experience. To top it off when we recieved the bill, it was wet and the bill folder had mold growing inside it... I know right? It gets worse though, the restaurant was kind enough to throw in a side of food poisoning for all the troubles.Overall overpriced frozen food with unsanitary conditions. Avoid at all costs!"
2015-08-04,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Casa San Carlo Italian Restaurant,"This review pertains ONLY to the lunch buffet.  Not ordering off the menu.  What a treasure for $8.95.  The great tragedy in my life now is that this place is way the heck in N. Raleigh, so I can't go there often for lunch since I work downtown.  If you think Milton's is the only game in N. Raleigh for the italian lunch buffet category, you really need to check this place out.  One caveat.  If you just want pizza, better go somewhere else.  This is an Italian place, not a Pizza place.  So if you aren't in the mood for yummy chicken marsala, salmon with linguine and capers, and the like, then go elsewhere.  Oh, and did I mention its amazingly only 8.95?  I'm actually glad I work 10 miles away.  Otherwise, I'd be in here at least once a week and eating way too much rich, delicious Italian."

The hummus was bland and thin, and the baba ganoush....for lack of a better way to explain it...hurt my tongue! It had a ""tin"" taste. The salad was just a salad with barely average dressing. I regret coming here.....and I don't remember the last time I said that about a Mediterranean restaurant.  Don't waste your time."

I got the Wednesday special and the chicken is so tender and flavorful, the beans are amazing (not bland at all like some places) and the pico de gallo on top is to die for. Amazing quick service, sweet cashiers and amazing food."

Tandoori chicken came sizzling on a hot plate. It was delicious. We ordered lamb saag and naans. Again, were very pleased. Anyone looking for good Indian food, will find this, probably the best in the Triangle."
2015-08-05,5.0,"Saint Louis, MO",Ole Time Barbecue,"Hush puppies were by far the best thing!!! And I know the owner is against it but I lived in South Carolina and mustard sauce FOR THE WIN! I think there should be options other than just ketchup and vinegar-based sauce. It was good for what it was and how hungry I was, but I won't make it a destination when I get back to the Raleigh-area."

2015-08-05,4.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Gringo A Go-Go,"My husband and I found Gringo A Go Go last night as we were searching for parking downtown. I am obsessed with good Mexican so when we saw it we decided to give up downtown for the night and try it out. Best decision ever. We have yet to find a good Mexican restaurant in Raleigh. I knew from the moment we walked in that it was going to be spectacular. Very unassuming space, but very friendly staff and cozy decor. It was too hot to sit outside, but I can see when it gets cooler that I will be enjoying many margaritas out on the porch. Alberto greeted us and was an amazing waiter. We both ordered margaritas and chips/guac to start, and we were happy to notice that they didn't ask us any questions about how we wanted our margs made (salt, on the rocks). A good sign. The guac and chips came out and they were out of this world. The only place I have had fresh chips in Raleigh (FRESH as in tortillas that are cut, then fried) are at my brother's house. It did not disappoint. We ended up ordering 2 more salsas (sesame which was amazing but too spicy for me, and pico which was great). My husband ordered 3 tacos and I ordered 2 as well as the condiment tray. The highlight for me was the carnitas and surprisingly the pollo. We left way too full but so excited that we had found this right down the street. I have no idea why we haven't heard of it before. I'm torn between announcing it to the world and keeping it to myself. But I think I will do everyone else a favor and spread the word. GO TO GRINGO A GO GO!!!!!"
2015-08-05,4.0,"Clayton, NC",Pho Vietnam,"GREAT FOOD!  We are now regulars.  We were formally Pho Far East regulars but their service slipped while prices edged upward.  Pho Vietnam restaurant is less crowded, better flavors and great prices.  Dinner for 3 is around $30 and you walk away very full.  The sandwich with the BBQ pork with lemon grass is amazing.  It is a perfect compliment to a bowl of Pho.  We have tried about half the items on the menu now.  While some are better than others...they all are quite good and very satisfying.  What I like most is the cuts of meat have the fat trimmed.  This makes the broth less fatty and the sandwiches more enjoyable.  Traditionalists like all the fat...me, I will pass.  I appreciate lean meat with the fat trimmed off."
2015-08-06,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Alpaca Peruvian Charcoal Chicken,"I've reviewed this place so many times and Yelp seems to kick it offline. This is the last time...It's newer, cleaner, and more generic than the original, but the food simply isn't as good. I can't put my finger on it, though. It's either the chicken is too dry or doesn't have that same flavor, but it's something. Still, I come here often and always enjoy my time."
2015-08-06,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Vivace,"Vivace is an excellent choice for dinner at North Hills! We went here on a Wednesday night and it was surprisingly busy, so I was glad we made reservations beforehand. It definitely felt more like a Friday night, with the bar bustling and a few big parties celebrating. So it had a really great atmosphere. If you want to eat outside, they also have a small patio with umbrellas.We ordered the Prosciutto San Danielle as our appetizer, which is prosciutto topped with some of their homemade cheese, grilled strawberries, and a drizzle of balsamic. It does sound like an odd combination to have meat, strawberries, and cheese all together in one bite, but the flavors complemented each other very well and it was a delicious dish. I've been here several times, and my favorite items on the menu are their pizzas. Don't get me wrong, the pasta and other dishes are great too, but the pizzas are big enough for 2 meals for me and they are a good deal. This time I ordered the Carne pizza, which had so much flavor. There were some hot peppers on it, so for those who can't handle heat, I suggest ordering one of the other pizzas. It is a thin crust, and I like that they don't put on too much sauce, because I get to taste more of the cheese.Vivace is a great option if you are looking for a place for a date night or a place to celebrate. They have great service and good food!"
2015-08-06,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Brio Tuscan Grille,"Note that the 5 stars applies to the happy hour deal only.  Stopped back in for happy hour.   Another glass of that great red for DH along with the Brio burger.  I enjoyed a very alcoholic lemonade with another delectable plate of carpaccio.   All items were sekected from the happy hour menu and all were $4-$5.  GREAT BARGAIN!  And excellent food.While waiting for our food, we perused the regular dinner menu.  The entrées were priced about right.  Appetizers seemed higher priced than similar restaurants,  but if the servings are large and well prepared, then okay.   But the markup in the wine was INSANE.  4x minimum on the lower priced bottles!  I know the per glass price was equal to or only one dollar less than I can buy an entire bottle for at retail.  Example:  19 Crimes Red blend is $8 per glass.  So, we'll return for HH, maybe even get an entree while sitting at the bar enjoying the HH wine prices (there are tables in the bar area for small groups).  But we won't be eating in the dining room because if that ridiculous wine bottle price gouging."
2015-08-06,5.0,"Cary, NC",Ole Time Barbecue,"When I asked people who has the best 'cue, a spirited argument broke out. Only a few punches were thrown, but Ole Time Barbecue (OTB) was a commonly cited top candidate. I had some time today, so I decide to make my hermitage trek to OTB.OTB has a great 'cue pedigree. It is family-owned side-of-the-railroad tracks shack that seems too short to stand up in that is wall papered from trotter to snout in signs, clippings, personal memorabilia, and junk. It's like sitting in your Aunt Boo Boo's trailer home who makes crazy good food, drinks sweet tea from a mayonnaise jar, and has paper towels rolls everywhere within reach. The worn out booths, home made counter, and knotty pine wood sidings should feel comfortable and homey enough without being too divey. All dine-in patrons get a generous basket of hush puppies, which to date, are the best I have ever had. Crunchy, long, not too sweet, not greasy, and the size of your thumb. The pork was much more chopped than any other that I have had. So it wasn't stringy or chunky; but yet, it wasn't dry. OTB's pork was on the milder side (ie, less smokey, very easy on the cider vinegar, and gently spiced) - but yet easily stood on its own without sauce. This is great for those who like straight-forward great tasting BBQ pork, but yet leaves room for those who want to put their own sauce on it. This may be a plus because rarely do two people like their BBQ the same way.  I also had collards and fried okra. The okra was perfect - crunchy, fresh okra, not oily, and not too salty. The collards were delicious, but skewed toward the sweet & oniony side of the spectrum. All in all, fantastic 'cue that delivered what people had raved about. Service is functional, but done by staff/family who look and act like they have been doing it for a long, long, long time. Lots of scowling and certainly not a lot of chirpy small talk. Let's call it curt and functional, but certainly not disrespectful. December 17 2015 update: I am convinced that the family and staff here aren't necessarily grumpy. They are actually quite friendly, but their communication style is salty and snarky. They clearly love their regulars and it shows. Actually, I've come to love their tart-mouthed Southern good ole boy banter. I want to bring a few cases of beer to these guys just to chat with them and listen to them get louder, saltier, and ineffably more Southern as the beers went down. I put OTB on par with Backyard BBQ Pit in Durham (BBP). OTB atmosphere is not so awful you can't dine-in like BBP, but it doesn't have as good of sides in the limited offerings I had. But its milder style will please more delicate palates in your family - like kids. I think this is a conscious effort so that diners can add their own vinegar to their collards and their own amount of hot sauce to their BBQ. I look forward to many other visits to really see how the battle lines are drawn out. But right now, my favorite BBQ in the Triangle are #1) BBP, #2) OTB, #3) The Pit; but it is a photo finish and each one brings something different (great food/value at a dive, very good BBQ/chicken in hillbilly heaven, and gentrified BBQ you can take out of towners to). Push the ""Cool"" button if you disagree and demand that I should keep eating OTB until I see the error in my ways that OTB is clearly #1,"
2015-08-06,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",PDQ,"The only reason I marked PDQ of 6305 Falls of Neuse Rd, Raleigh, NC 27615 a fair was when I had an occasion to enjoy their food it was really good!On Friday July 31st about 6pm, I and a friend entered this store and ordered two full combo meals my friend ordered a shake to add to his meal. I presented coupons for a free combo meal and a free shake. The gentleman at register had to check to see if these coupons were good! He spoke to a young lady who was dressed in a chefs style white smock/jacket. I can only assume she was an manager. She came to order area and said that the coupon was expired and no longer redeemable as printed. I asked when was this effective she responded 8/1! I responded wait you mean tomorrow (as that day was Friday, July 31st) she continued to say that in a meeting was had and they stopped accepting their own coupon. Again I said but you said it expires tomorrow and she turned on her heals walked away from us. I was not loud or anything but professorial to any of this staff. The Cashier said and shown me ""see there is no expiration date in a very obvious place it should have written in! It simply was left blank.I earned the right to use these coupons printed on heavy stock almost credit card sized by being handed these coupons by a PDQ's agent at the Southern Women's Show Raleigh back in April this year. Never told of an expiration date and this agent did not write one! Nothing printed on this coupon by printer or its small print spoke of when it would expire. I have no idea if PDQ in this market is a corporate store or run by franchisees, either way this is wholly unprofessional conduct of denying service in this fashion even the day before cancellation date as slated in a said meeting for a future date was wrong, worse yet being disrespected front of a friend. I did not print your coupons in a dingy basement your agent handed me many just for being at a trade show.Raleigh as I have always stated is an eating out town and those restaurants that are somewhat unique would benefit by being better then others not by printing say 1000 coupons as a business decision to create new business in a new market then cut them off. Your management of this location made a poor decision this day and have hurt your future prospect if this is the way you want to manage PDQ in Raleigh NC. I shall not consider PDQ as a future place to take care of my wish to eat out! I could have gone to Chick Fil A, or any of the many of your competitors serving your cuisine but wanted better but I was wrong your not better just a little more expensive and less concerned about the clientele."

First of all, I asked for no mayonnaise on my sandwich and when I arrived, it was covered in mayonnaise. The overall restaurant was not very clean, the waitresses were not attentive, and one of them crashed into me when I was trying to leave the restaurant because she was too busy horsing around with the other waiters on staff.

So they are a surf & turf place in my thoughts, because they have something for everybody. They frequently run specials and will send out discount coupons, so make sure that you sign up for their email club.  As far as the food, I have ordered the fish tacos, burger, and something I can't recall. The fish tacos I really enjoyed. And the burger is listed as a ""American Kobe Beef burger"" because true Kobe beef comes ONLY from a certain region in Japan, and is very expensive in the USA. The American fake Kobe does not have the same taste or texture as true Kobe, and taste just like a good quality burger. But you wouldn't make a hamburger out of Kobe beef, as that is steak material. And any foodie, that is a food connoisseur, knows what I am talking about. The staff is nice, but I do have one issue, they need a bigger restroom. An extra stall would be nice. Those things are important when you are stuck in a place and you need to go. Whoever designed the bathroom must have been thinking that the customers were going to leave and go somewhere else to use it. I'm just sayin'.But I would return again and try something new.#392"

I had heard about this chain years ago but finally stopped in after being tempted by their complimentary nacho car for happy hour (M-F, 4 to 7pm). So I stopped in on a Tuesday at about 5:30 and it was a mellow scene. The bartenders at Chuy's were super-prompt, they all immediately took care of drink orders and clued me in on the nachos. And while I did dig into the nachos (super, thin, crisp chips with queso, seasoned beef, tomatoes and refried beans), I also did the chicka-chicka boom enchiladas. Good eats with just the right amount of food for $10. Poking around the space you'll immediately notice the colorful decor ranging from painted wooden fish, dog decor and more. While Chuy's may not be Mex-mex, it's good Tex-mex at a good price. I can see why this place works at North Hills with its reasonable prices, good service and huge patio.

I certainly recomend the pizza, the camaleri is our favorite and I love the Roast Chicken.While service has never been bad, it's never been more than mediocre until today. Our server Scottie was phenomenal and did a fantastic job at making us all feel welcome. It was as if his sole job at that time was to offer us hospitality and ensure we were pleased. Thank you Scottie for making my day! I must say, this visit was likely the first I can remember that my beverage was refilled before I , my husband, or daughter was drinkless for 5 to 10 minutes before being offered a replacement. A beat wasn't missed and there wasn't a moment I had wanted for anything.One thing is I wished I would have known about the Mimosa and Bloody Mary with option to create my own for the past year I've been visiting, but am pleased to have been offered it this morning and surely will enjoy it in the future. Make my own? How fun!If I had thought to write a review based on my past it would have been 2.5 stars for great food and ok service that wasn't anything to complain about nor anything to rave about.

2015-08-09,5.0,"San Jose, CA",The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar,"I came here for my birthday dinner; it's definitely a good spot for groups. The 'burgushi' (burger + sushi)  concept on their menu is super creative and delicious I might add. I'd recommend ordering off the 'burgushi' section of their menu because what are the odds of finding another place that combines these two things so wonderfully! I tried the ""What's Shakin' Tuna Bacon Sandwich' minus the bacon. The tuna was seared perfectly and so flavorful. The tuna came in between grilled spring roll wrapper buns...most creative 'buns' I've ever tried.Also the crab rangoon dip is a great shareable appetizer.I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order here. They've got a great selection of cocktails/spiked shakes/ etc. as well.Our server was really nice, attentive, and managed our different orders and requests well. Our food also came out quickly which I really appreciated. It always sucks to sit at a table with a group of hangry friends. Be warned that the servers will stop by your table and sing loudly and obnoxiously for your birthday. It's fun but it did get a little distracting and loud after a while because the singing was almost constant (singing to other tables). The place is huge and has a cylindrical fish tank in the center of their space...great for fish watching :PAll in all, a great place for a large group, kids, family dinner, etc. I'm knocking a star off because they don't take reservations. If you've got a big group just get there early to put your name down for a table."

They also have some amazing milkshakes (with sprinkles, for funsies) and the best fries I've had at a burger joint. There's several different ways you can have your fries but my personal favorite is Urban Style - parmesan cheese, herbs and garlic aioli. YES. Also, this isn't really my thing but even I can respect their massive onion rings. If that's the way you choose to live your life, I recommend giving those a try. They look majestic."

It was pretty small for the price. Don't get me wrong the taste was great, but for the price I could have gotten a bigger burger for the same quality somewhere else. The fries portion was pretty good for the price. For two burgers, two fries, and two drinks it was thirty dollars. Food quality was good and the taste of things was great, but this isn't my first choice for a burger place"

The calamari appetizer was great. The cherry stone clam appetizer was awful. The rigatoni and meatballs was delicious. The fresh mozzarella salad was awful. The sweet tea was great. The ginger ale was flat. The servers were confused and offered us several other people's orders multiple times. Our waiter was friendly and courteous. Their coal fired oven was broken and they were sold out of their trout special. The complimentary tomato bisque was delicious. The server dropped garlic bread on my white pants. I will not go back- just totally unpredictable and not worth the risk. They seemed frantic to close at the end of the evening- dismantling takes and taking down umbrellas next to us while we were eating! They don't close until 10 but They were taking down tables at 9:15.
2015-08-09,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",P.G. Werth’s,"P.G. Werth Review The food was good, and the service was excellent. But the ambience was lacking.  The chairs were uncomfortable, and the benches were miserable. The concrete floors and full-length glass windows may be cool and clean design, but they are an acoustical nightmare. The noise was deafening. A few soft touches might take some of the edge off the design, but some creature comforts would add to the overall experience. I would start with some sheer drapes, a few colorful rugs, and get rid of the benches. This certainly isn't a rustic place. The staff were friendly and competent, and the restaurant was rather pricey: $35 with no drinks.  All that's needed is literally to take off some of the rough edges."
2015-08-09,3.0,"Myrtle Beach, SC",Winston’s Grille,"Have been eating here sine this restaurant opened.  Tonight was really really bad.  No 1. Too much garlic in blue cheese dressing. No 2 bread was stale. No 3 music was unbearable.  After 20 plus years will not go back,  also prices outrageous."

2015-08-09,5.0,"Durham, NC",Irregardless Cafe & Catering,"Living in Durham, I rarely get to the Raleigh food scene and while I have been to Irregardless before, I figured it had been nearly 12 years. I've been missing out. The hummus appetizer had fresh cherry tomatoes and cucumber slices in addition to the traditional pita bread. I had the chili relleno and the black been cake it was stuffed with was wonderful. It won't be 12 years before I go back. The violin and viola duet that started the evening entertainment was a nice touch."
2015-08-09,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Papa’s Pizza & Subs,I was looked for a place for a quick bite. I saw the rating/reviews for this Papa's Pizza & Subs so I decided to try it. & I was NOT disappointed. I had the Meat Calzone & BBQ wings. Both were SOOOOO good. But the wings tho..... they were AWESOME. Perfectly fried & smothered in tangy BBQ sauce. I highly recommend this place for good pizza & wings. & im sure the other items on the menu are exceptional as well
2015-08-10,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",El Tapatio Mexican Restaurant,"If margaritas on the cheap is your style, then El Tapatio will fit you like a glove. On Wednesdays you can partake of the $2.99 lime margs all day.  But while you are there, try the Carnitas de Puerco.  So. Good.  Annnddd...try the Carnitas de Pollo. Why not?  The dishes aren't much over $12 or $13 for a lot of them. Give your wallet a break and your taste buds a treat and hit this place up."
2015-08-10,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Pam’s Farm House,"I'm so sorry Y'all but this place was a disappointment. Now this place is only open until 2pm and we arrived for breakfast around 11:30am. First of all they were out of potatoes, and sausage gravy so if you have your heart set on those items get there early. The kids ordered hot chocolate and they don't have whip cream for it, ok fine. The biscuits were dry and there was no apple butter or anything yummy to put on them only little jelly packets. Also, no real butter only butter spread. Yuck!  And no half and half for coffee either. Pancakes are real thick and pretty dry but the flavor was good. The sausage links were tough, dry and over cooked. So, in my opinion you could've gotten a tastier breakfast at Waffle House so don't waste your money at this place. Sorry"
2015-08-10,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Glenwood Grill,"Glenwood Grill has been on my radar for awhile so I figured it was time to give it a try.  We came on a weeknight for dinner and were seated right away.  We were seated in a middle table and I asked if we could take a corner table to which the waitstaff quickly and politely obliged.  The space is small and very intimate.  Tables are placed very close together so it's not a great place to have a private conversation.  We chose the carpetbagger (2 four ounce filets mignons, parsnip smashed potatoes, parmesan fried oysters, red wine veal reduction, béarnaise $28) and the beef short rib Rockefeller style (a la carte item, $14).  The food was arranged beautifully and came out quickly.  The carpetbagger was delicious! The filet mignon was tender and had the perfect amount of pink in it. The mashed potatoes were delicious and full of flavor.  The oysters were good, but probably my least favorite part of this plate as the frying took a lot of the unique oyster taste away. The beef short rib was interesting as the only food I've had Rockefeller style are of course oysters.  The beef was so flavorful and tender that I didn't even need a knife to cut through it.  It must have been slow cooked for hours to get that kind of flavor in.  Overall though, I didn't enjoy the Rockefeller part and had to scrape off the spinach/cheese/breadcrumbs on top.  The beef short ribs alone were quite delectable.Overall, the food was good and the service was attentive.  Unfortunately, not a great atmosphere as there was no privacy and the place was very loud.  I enjoyed both dishes but there were aspects to each I didn't like.  I will certainly be back to try their other dishes however!"
2015-08-10,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",State of Beer,"State of Beer is quickly becoming one of my favorite spots in Raleigh to go to!My husband and I have been here twice and will be back many more times in the future, I'm sure. State of Beer is located right off of Hillsborough Street, not far from Flying Saucer. They have a long bar inside as well as a pretty good selection of beers that you can buy to take home. They also have outdoor seating which will be especially nice when the weather gets a little cooler.One thing that sets this bottle shop apart from all of the other bottle shops in the area is the fact that they have food. And great food it is! On both of my visits we have been here for lunch and ordered a sandwich to go with our beers. Both times I got the prosciutto sandwich which is topped with whipped brie, arugula, spicy dijon mustard and pickled cherry peppers. I love this sandwich! It is the perfect combination of spicy and sweet. They have a variety of other unique sandwiches on their menu (my husband really liked the turkey wrap) and the bread the sandwiches are served on is so good! The sandwiches also come with a side - chips, mixed green salads (topped with goat cheese, walnuts, pickled beets- also so good!) or chickpea salad.Their beer selection is solid and they often have beers that I have not seen on draft anywhere else. The people who work here are very knowledgable about beer and extremely friendly.State of Beer, I am a huge fan and will recommend you to everyone!"
2015-08-10,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bonefish Grill,I know everyone tends to gravitate toward the bang bang shrimp... or dinner options BUT I prefer the brunch at Bonefish!! This past Sunday we visited and were surprised to find that they recently remodeled this location. Love the new look!  I ordered the California omelet with egg whites and it didn't disappoint. It looked like a small portion but it kept me full for most people f the day. I look forward to visiting again soon!!
2015-08-10,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Rockford,"I'm not sure how many ownership changes the Rockford has been through since its better days, but from menu to atmosphere its better days are definitely long past. The menu is stripped bare of interesting choices and other than the ABC sandwich the classics like the mission burrito, eggplant sandwich, and sweet potato quesadilla are gone. Meatless options are reduced to a couple of sad salads and a pathetic beet sandwich that was nothing more than sliced cooked beets and condiments on a bun - $7, and no side included. That's right; the Rockford charges for sides now. There were three available when we went, including a kale side none of us tried, brussels sprouts cooked with bacon that were unremarkable, and if you like your macaroni and cheese to be completely without any discernible flavour you have found your destination restaurant. Service was equally bland despite the place being almost empty well before closing, and while there used to be a fair selection of craft beers to be enjoyed I noticed that the drink menus we received didn't list a single beer available on tap. It's a far cry from what it used to be, and I doubt I'll see much more of it unless things change quite a bit."
2015-08-10,4.0,"West Grove, PA",Pearl Chinese Restaurant,Roast Pork Noodle soup somewhat disappointing the realm of all I've had.  Broth very bland which is usually my favorite part.  Chicken and string beans nicely prepared and tasty.

2015-08-10,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Casa San Carlo Italian Restaurant,We visited once when we were in the mood for Italian. The decor was nice but the space felt a little crammed.

2015-08-10,5.0,"Durham, NC",The Mecca Restaurant,"I eat at Mecca a few times a month because it's locally owned, good, and close to my work. I don't know that I'd go out of my way to go there- it's really just a diner, but they have a pretty killer BLT and the servers are really nice. I usually sit at the bar and in the summer it is cooooold in that spot. The AC blows straight down."
2015-08-10,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Casa San Carlo Italian Restaurant,"BUYER BEWARE!  We choose  this ""place"" because it had 4 stars and a FEW good reviews.  Big Mistake. Bread in basket was warm lumps of flavored  dough. The Veal Parma thickly coated with breadcrumbs and dried out.  Tomato sauce tasted like it came out of a can. Not even a fleck of spices. I asked for my Eggplant Parma to be cooked well and cheese browned. It came to the table with a 3x3 slice of deli mozzarella that looked like sliced white bread. Very unappetizing with some eggplant flavor. The kitchen thought it humorous that it came back. Was told there would be a slight up charge to get the gnocchi as the side pasta. Received the bill. Slight??? $10.00! It was a cup of potato mush. A disgrace to the way authentic gnocchi should taste. The waiter said $2.00 would be taken off the bill. I asked to see the manager, Melissa. After waiting 15 minutes, watching her joking and giggling at the bar I decided to get up and speak with her. Melissa disappeared into the kitchen. This woman represents the owner?? I hope the owner, #1- fires her, she is not qualified to take care of the customers. #2- hire a chef that knows how to cook Italian food. #3- gets serious about serving ""Authentic Italian with the freshest of ingredients"" or stop taking people's hard earned cash. I gave it one star for our gracious waiter, Eric and the unsweetened tea. Don't waste you $$."
2015-08-10,2.0,"Madison, CT",18 Seaboard,"My husband and I had lunch at 18 Seaboard recently and it was honestly one of the most memorable meals I've ever had.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is quite nice.  Clean, contemporary, and comfortable.  We were there on a weekday and the restaurant was rather busy with a lot of clientele who looked like businessmen and women on their lunch hour.Service was prompt and friendly.  We shared the She Crab Soup, which was incredibly tasty.  Not too heavy or rich, and the sweetness of the crab really shined.  My husband had the chicken salad sandwich, which was good but not anything particularly special.  On the other hand, my BLT made with fried green tomato and bacon jam was superb.  I grudgingly let my husband try a bite and he agreed that it was definitely the thing to order.  We hadn't planned on dessert, but the special that day was a goat cheese cheesecake and we just had to try it.  It exceeded all expectations.  I would drive from Connecticut back to North Carolina in a heartbeat just to have that lunch again!"

2015-08-11,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Oak,"A group of three went for restaurant week-and we were very happy we did! The menu is seasonal, so the next time we go it will be different. Two of us got mac and cheese,which we felt was sub par-not super cheesy. The other app we got was the fried sprouts and were they good! Even better with the dipping sauce. I got the cow+pig+bun and I was so happy after my meal, I didn't even need dessert. The burger was big and had a little bit of everything with the egg and pimento cheese. The rest of our party got the heritage farm pork tenderloin-let's just say both plates were clean! The fried polenta and vegetables were a nice balance with the pork and house made relish. They had rotating desserts which we found to be just okay after our meals. The highlight was definitely the main course"
2015-08-11,5.0,"Fremont, CA",Mellow Mushroom,"If you're gluten free and have celiac (or just eat gluten free) eat here. They have their own separate kitchen where they cook gluten free things, but be sure to tell them you have a wheat allergy or they'll just cook it in the regular kitchen. If they mess up your order, they'll give you another one and let you keep the wrong one. Margaritas are about $9 each, but if you have two you'll be ready for a night out. Great food, service is awesome. Love the outdoor seating. Their salads are also amazing, avocado and caramelized onions make a salad amazing. I love coming here!"
2015-08-11,5.0,"Garner, NC",Casa San Carlo Italian Restaurant,"We were really excited to try this place after a raving review from a friend. Sadly, we were very disappointed. The food was rather bland (I ordered the pollo capriccioso) and VERY overpriced. The wine selection was nice and they have a full bar, their saving grace. The owner was extremely nice, however, our server was pushy. I could also hear another server at the host stand complaining about being a sat a table in his section of just one older gentlemen. The atmosphere was somewhat romantic but the tables are really close together. I could hear every conversation that was going on at every other table. I can make better pasta at home in my Kitchen Aid."
2015-08-11,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gringo A Go-Go,"Enjoyed a quick, fresh lunch Saturday on our first visit to Gringo A Go-Go.  We ordered chips and salsa (nice that you get to try 2 of their many salsa options), chicken enchiladas, Mexican cheese empanada and black bean and corn empanada, relish plate and Victoria Mexican beer (surprisingly flavorful for a low alcohol beer).  We'll return again soon the next time were on the east side of downtown Raleigh!"
2015-08-11,5.0,"Harrisburg, PA",Firebirds Wood Fired Grill,"Went here on a Saturday evening with my family from out of town.  Cannot say enough good things about the food!  For starters, the bread was delicious and they kept bringing out more as soon as we had gone through the first loaf!  I got the meatloaf, which was unlike anything I had ever had before and by far the best meatloaf I have ever tasted.  My dad had the New York strip and his was phenomenal as well!  Can't wait to go back!"

2015-08-12,4.0,"Knightdale, NC",Sawasdee Thai Restaurant,"This place is tops! My partner and I go here often when we need a Thai food fix. Our go-tos are the Pad Thai Woon Sen and the Drunken Noodles. We also like the Fish Cakes and Steamed Dumplings. The Steamed Dumplings are especially nice...almost like an extra large Shumai with a yummy balls of fresh ground meat in the center. The Satay is not that great, so I would suggest skipping that dish. And for dessert, the Kanom Tuay (Sweet Coconut Pudding) is an absolute must! It's like a sweet rice gluten custard with a layer of coconut cream on top. It's a nice simple flavor and is very addicting. I will say it's quite a small serving, so I wouldn't suggest sharing."

2015-08-12,5.0,"Williamsburg, VA",Taste Small Plates | Wine Bar,"Taste was a lovely surprise tucked back in a neighborhood but worth the short drive. The front half of Taste is full of high tops that are first come first serve and a medium size bar. The back area has tables and reservations are accepted. The bartender was very friendly and did a great job, telling us about the drink specials, recommending wines and menu items. Knowledgeable and friendly staff is a huge plus. As soon as guests left he quickly cleared and cleaned the bar area and welcomed new guests as soon as they were seated. I appreciated his warm welcome, being a business traveler. We ordered the chicken & waffle, the tuna and the bruschetta to share. The bruschetta was served with very thin crispy bread, which was just right to deliver the yummy tomatoness! I liked the chicken and waffle but it was a bit heavy for me, delicious but it's very hearty. The tuna was perfect, get it with the avocado!Taste has a great outdoor area but it was pouring rain, so we didn't get to enjoy it, but I bet it would be great place to enjoy on a nice night."

2015-08-13,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Clockwork,"While its website gives me a headache and does it no justice, Clockwork is a nicely decorated, comfortable lounge that serves some awesome food. Why has nobody told me about this place? I had the Fresh House Handmade Gnocchi topped with a basil pesto cream sauce and served with fresh, local tomatoes and basil toast delizioso; and The Triple Dip which included white bean hummus, Kalamata olive tapenade, Ajvar (Roasted red peppers, eggplant, garlic & olive oil) and was served with Pita bread.The handmade gnocchi were delicious. Not too firm, not mushy. Just right. The basil pesto cream sauce was fantastic. It had an unmistakable nutty undercurrent that went perfectly with the cheese/cream/basil base. It was served with fresh tomatoes and basil that sat atop little toasted ovals, not unlike bruschetta. I ate it all.The triple dip was a flavor party! The white bean hummus was some of the best I have had. Creamy and tasteful, just the right amount of oil. The Kalamata olive tapenade, although meant to be consumed as a dip, was eaten with a spoon from my plate. And the Ajvar was superb. The peppers were roasted perfectly so that the flavor was meaningful and present but not overbearing.This was an incredibly pleasant surprise. I thought I was going to a funky bar to have bar food, and I was served locally sourced, fresh, handmade cuisine. I love it when this happens!"
2015-08-13,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",State of Beer,"Digging it.Was here on a weeknight with two other beer lovers and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Just know: it's counter service only.  The guy who busses tables and brings the food came around and asked ""Are you guys doing ok here?"" and I said ""I'll have another IPA please."" and he said ""Oh we don't have table service.""  We all had a chuckle, and I think he realized his queston was a little misleading.  And it *is* a little confusing.  If you do choose to get food, you order at the counter, but they bring that to you.  Beer you get right then and there and take it to the table yourself.  (Really not that confusing, but the question he posed threw me for a loop.)My friends and I shared a cheese plate.  It was sooooo good.  I liked the mustardy flavored cheese the best.  And of course the manchego.  Certainly will be returning here.  It's close.  It's pretty cheap.  And I love beer.  That is all."

2015-08-13,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Nashers Sandwich House,"If Jeff Mauro were to come to town, I would have to take him here to show him he's not the only Sandwich King!  All three things we tried on this Thursday evening were truly stellar!  Husband's Roast Beef Melt with Roasted Garlic-Horseradish Butter, Swiss, Caramelized Onions on a Toasted Semolina Hero was sheer genius.  Every element perfect.  The beef was tender, lean, moist.  My Chicken Meatball Sub with Pesto Cream Sauce, Melted Mozzarella, Roasted Tomatoes, Cherry Peppers, Caramelized Onion on a Garlic Semolina Hero was a tasty work of art also!  And then the Housemade French Fries with Sea Salt, Cracked Black Pepper and Nashersauce to dip into...very good as well!  Neither of us could tell what was in the Nashersauce (besides mayo), but there was a slight smokey taste that would indicate a bit of chipotle perhaps.  Very mild though.Gal taking orders and serving could not have been more friendly, enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and helpful. The place is sparkling clean.  You order at the counter, then take a seat and wait.  Or wait out front with a game of cornhole perhaps.  The key word here is WAIT.  This is not fast food.  They are cooking from scratch per order, which is why I would probably call ahead and do a take-out next time. Especially since drinks are limited at this time.  They don't have beer or wine yet. (might never have wine).Our only complaint was that after waiting awhile for the sandwiches to come out (at least twenty minutes),  we still had another five minutes or so before the fries showed up.  We would really have liked them together.  That being said, all of it was worth the wait!  And the rest of the menu looks so phenomenal, we can't wait to try other things.  Besides killer-sounding-sandwiches, they also have salads, soups and sides like sweet potato tots, cast iron corn, and pimento mac and cheese.  (they were out of the tots when we were there).  This place is so new that I'm sure it will take awhile to work out the timing kinks, but with the quality and taste they are achieving, it's worth any growing pains!NOTE:  They also have a Pick 2 option with some of their soups, salads and sandwiches.If you're wondering WHERE on Durant Road they are, they are on the other side of the brick building that Bella Italia is in.  Near the Food Lion shopping center.  FIND them."

If you're into ""the game"" whatever that may be, they have you covered. Ultimately for my money, I'll always choose Wakefield Tavern for a good dinner and drink."

Had someone offered us a glass of wine or a complimentary appetizer, it would have made us feel a bit better."

2015-08-14,5.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Vivace,"Took my family here when they were visiting from CA. We had a lovely meal which included:1. Beef carpaccio - raw, thinly sliced beef with capers. Light and refreshing way to start the meal. 2. Brussel sprouts - paired with tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, and light hints of some type of creamy sauce that added an extra dimension of flavor.3. Caprese salad - fresh cheese slices paired with basil and tomatoes. A classic.4. Ribeye steak - very large portion size, perfect for meat lovers, paired with earthy root vegetables in a gravy-like sauce. 5. Olive oil cake - paired with hints of orange and a side of mascarpone cheeseOverall, I'd give the food 4 stars. Honestly, I've had better Italian, but everything here was good to quite good. I'd say this restaurant would be a dependable place for a tasty, albeit not awe-inspiring, meal. But the service is truly absolutely outstanding! Polite, extremely attentive in the most unobtrusive way possible. Staff know the menu and gave wonderful wine pairing suggestions. Additionally, my dad is very picky in the type of pasta and sauce he likes to eat. The waiter was able to talk to the chef, and they created a dish specifically for my dad. That meant quite a lot to me, and propels them to 5 star status. Bravo!"

Collards were sloppy and subpar."
2015-08-14,5.0,"Garner, NC",P.G. Werth’s,"LOVED IT!!  Great Food, great service and a really cool space.Atmosphere 4 - This place really did have a great Brunch vibe.  The dining room seems to be all windows making it sunny and bright.  The décor is very upscale.  My only knock on the place is the dinning room can get a bit loud.  I am sure the bottomless Mimosas did not help with that.Service 5 - It is funny I read some of the earlier reviews really bagging on the service.  I think the owner must have read the review as well.  When I went the service was just on the edge of too attentive.  They made sure that I left with the sense that my dinning experience really mattered to them. The chef/owner came out and chatted with us briefly.  When my wife mentioned that her egg yolks were not a runny as she had wanted he was very apologetic.  Again our dinning experience was clearly very important to him.Cost/Value 5 -   The brunch menu prices run from $9 to $13.  For the quality of what you are getting that is a great value.Food 5+ - I really liked what the chef did with the menu.  Many of the dishes on the menu are simple Southern classics that were molded into haute cuisine by a talented culinary artist.  I had the Grayson Highlands Burger.  It was definitely one of the better hamburgers I have eaten.  The house made jala-pimento cheese was just melting and the burger was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  My wife had the Southern Benedict.  The flavors and textural contrasts really made this dish.  You had the sweet and fluffy sweet potato biscuit with the savory sausage and crispy fried green tomato coated in a silky smooth vegetable stock based gravy.  This was a great take on a very ubiquitous brunch item.I did like the Bottomless Mimosa was pretty cool as well."
2015-08-14,5.0,"Apex, NC",Plates Neighborhood Kitchen,"Nice ambiance but overprice.  Food was ok nothing to brag about.  Service not so good, we had a table of 10 people, we had to constantly ask for watt refill or wine etc.  Gravlax Eggs Benedict was terrible and $15.00 :-(.  There was maybe 3 strings of very very thing and small gravlax.   I heard the burger was good."

2015-08-15,5.0,"Key West, FL",J Betski’s,"This is a wonderful little place in Seaboard Station! You feel like you're transported into another place, not Raleigh, NC. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but the sausages are amazing. The dipping sauce that comes with the fries -- so amazing. Get the sausage all the way, they have great sauerkraut. After stuffing yourself, try to save a little room for the bacon chocolate torte. I'm pretty sure they pipeline that straight from heaven. It's only the size of a snickers bar, but it's incredibly dense and rich. It's best to split between 2-3 people, just because sausages are so filling. It's a small venue, so I wouldn't go with a group over 6 people. The staff are amazing and attentive."
2015-08-15,5.0,"Greensboro, NC",Salt & Lime Cabo Grill,"My thoughts about this place are all over the place. The food was pretty good generally. I was impressed with the seasoned chips and the smokey salsa. I had the traditional fish taco - the pickled radishes were so delicious; excellent touch! As recommended, I tried two margaritas - the blood orange and the spicy jalapeño. The blood orange was overly sweet but the jalapeño was delicious - a nice balance of spicy and sweet. I tried my boyfriend's food and drink as well - the grilled watermelon margarita and the braised rib tacos. The margarita tasted like straight sugar - so sweet that the watermelon flavor was lost. The braised ribs were decent, but there was so much sugar in the BBQ sauce that it overpowered the meat. Without the sauce the taco would have been perfection. Also, we had a big group and after our meal finished the manager hovered over us several times encouraging us to leave. It bothered us all quite a bit. I think that after spending over $700 for the table we deserved to sit there for a few minutes beyond paying."
2015-08-15,5.0,"Holly Springs, NC",Kabab and Curry,"We went for dinner and had an exceptional meal and outstanding service. I ordered lamb curry, which was tender and very flavorful. I had the option of choosing the level of heat I wanted, and since my wife is not so much into spicy, I chose medium. It was very still very, very good. My wife ordered the navaratna korma and loved it. (I did, too.) It had a sweeter coconut milk flavor to it, was not spicy, and had a great assortment of vegetables. We will definitely go back."
2015-08-15,5.0,"Garner, NC",Mellow Mushroom,"We have never been disappointed.  So many different varieties of pizza to try.  The single size is just right for dinner and leftovers for lunch the next day.   Only drawback is that this location does not have a lot of parking, so the usual busy nights during the week and over the weekend can make finding a spot a challenge."
2015-08-15,5.0,"Mt Arlington, NJ",Ole Time Barbecue,"This place is CRAZY good. Had an impromptu family reunion (here for USA Baseball), called and the couldn't accommodate the 10 of us at their facility. We ordered takeout instead and commandeered the hotels breakfast area. (Kudos to the Hyatt Place!). Coming in from NJ and Charlotte, we had NO CLUE where to eat so we relied on Yelp!, and the reviews were spot on. I can honestly say I have never experienced barbecue this good before, ever. 10 dinners, each different and not one mistake as well. O U T S T A N D I N G in every way."
2015-08-15,1.0,"San Antonio, TX",State Farmers Market Restaurant,"Maybe 3.5 stars. The food is average and the service was very good. I was disappointed in the OJ (from concentrate), I would expect fresh squeezed given proximity to the market. But, the eggs were cooked well and tasted like eggs, the sausage and bacon were good (nothing special), and the biscuits were about 3.5 stars - not spectacular but better than I can make. If you are headed to the Farmers Market and want a made-to-order breakfast, it works."

Dishes you must try: everythingchicken & waffles (there's a bite to this dish(love the hint of spice) + bacon in their waffle... unreal)surf & turf - best of both worlds : pork belly heaven married to scallop dreams of a lifetimedeconstructed tamale - so good you want to marry it!!!!!melon medley - please get this. it's way more than just melon on a plate. it's the entire experience you get from this dishelote - AMAZINGsliders - AMAZINGbread pudding with ice cream - HYFRhonestly I can't even find a bad thing to say about this place. the staff is incredible and extremely helpful. the wine selection is amazing and on Wednesday they're HALF OFF.in an ideal world i would be here 4-5 days a week no challenge.
2015-08-15,4.0,"Durham, NC",Mandolin,"We stopped in on a whim and these folks really have created something very special...  The service is exceptional and one can only nit-pick to find the flaws here...  The decor, setting and hospitality are really refreshing...  The room is a little noisy, but not unbearable...  At $99.00 for a family of three, with no alcohol, the food is a little pricey for the portion size, but not so much to keep us from coming back. (just an honest observation to consider).  My wife considers herself an expert on green beans and she was not impressed, again when paying what we consider premium dollars...Having said that, I would again recommend this breath of fresh air to anyone and plan to go back in the future..."
2015-08-15,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tasty 8’s,"My first visit since our Yelp event. (Hey, I'm not downtown often!)I like the clever concept of Tasty 8's:  Eight hot dog choices, Eight dipping sauces, Eight shakes, and 88's in the pricing.In the average hot dog place a choice means what condiments do you want on the one type of hot dog.  Not here!  Hot Dogs are make of Certified Angus Beef, Continental Sausage or Vegetarian Sausage.  Topping combinations are creative and tasty.  I like that the hot dogs are cut lengthwise with the center turned towards the inside of the bun - help the hot dog be more stable in the bun!I ordered the Windy City Weenie minus the raw onion and peppers, so it was a poppy seed bun, neon relish, tomato, celery salt, dill pickle & mustard on a 1/4 lb. certified angus beef hot dog.  With this I ordered fries with honey mustard dipping sauce.Loved the presentation.  Great flavor on both the hot dog and the fries.  If you are used to eating 2 or 3 regular hot dogs to fill you up, know that one hot dog and fries here is an ample meal.Not a cheap hot dog meal in price or quality, but as in most things, a quality product does cost more."
2015-08-15,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Barry’s Cafe,Thanks fellow Yelper Jean K. For your review of this place. The breakfast was hearty and the portions were generous. My son's current thing is fire trucks and so this was a good start to our fire truck themed day.  My husband had the spinach omelette which he liked. The biscuits and gravy were tasty and the half portion was more than enough.

2015-08-15,5.0,"Cary, NC",Centro,"This was amazing. The food here tastes like it's made with love. It contains all that is good about homemade food, with the bonus of sophisticated flavors, tastefully arranged plates, and no dishes afterward. It's a small space, and I've only been for lunch. The first time was with a field trip of about ten fourth graders. We were learning about organic vegetables, and Centro uses veggies from the Raleigh City Farm, where we'd just been. The kids had harvested some tiny carrots and radishes, and the staff kindly included them in our dishes. We had the most fragrant and flavorful little quesadillas you could imagine. They also served us delicious, iced hibiscus tea. Since then, when I still lived in Raleigh, I went there for lunch every month or so. It's a fab place to meet a friend. When not chatting and eating, you could find me ogling the ornately covered walls. The pressed-tin and painted vintage Mexican crosses, hearts, and flowers cover the walls. In addition, guest artists show their work. It's a not-to-miss, charming place with delicious food."
2015-08-15,5.0,"Cary, NC",Centro,"Great food and fun atmosphere. I've only been there twice but both times I ordered the tacos and they were great. A bit disappointed in the quality of the margarita that is made in the upstairs bar, the dining area bar makes them better but I was told that issue was resolved after I mentioned to my waitress that they did not taste the same. They ended up giving me one on the house!"
2015-08-16,1.0,"Durham, NC",Cafe Tiramisu,Best Italian food! The chicken saltimbocca is the best I've ever had! Eggplant parm is amazing  too! I. From upstate NY and have missed authentic Italian and This restaurant has satisfied that! Denise
2015-08-16,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Wade Park Cafe,Good lunch options.  Neat and clean but a weird feel.  Maybe because it's in an office building.  There are tables outside which I'm looking forward to using in the cooler weather!
2015-08-16,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Piola,"Meh. It's not a bad spot to eat, not awesome either. I will give them 5 stars on service though. Great service. There's pizza, there's beer, hard to mess that up. The pizza isn't really true to Italy, maybe in spirit but not in taste and presentation. While there I had the bruschetta, which came recommended. It was okay. Nothing that memorable. My dates loved her pizza, but didn't love mine that much. However, because I'm lactose intolerant I had to go without cheese on my pizza pie. Their pizza with the cheese lacked flavor and substance. All in all, it is okay. Not bad, but no wow factor."
2015-08-16,3.0,"Colleyville, TX",Poppyseed Market,"Great service. However, do you have to put onions on everything?Onions should always be optional unless your making French onion soup.We just moved here. We heard great things. Our service lived up to billing but food was hit or miss.The squash lasagna was fantastic and pizza awesome. However the chicken salad and egg salad and fish tacos had too many onions. I'm still tasting onions today--really.Finally, we ordered the brownie sundae for dessert.  Unfortunately, the brownie was dry,stale and tasteless.  That said, homemade vanilla bean ice cream was great."
2015-08-16,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chuy’s,"My best friend and I went to Chuy's for my birthday lunch. We've eaten lunch at Chuy's few times and I loved it whenever we came. I got my favorite(Elvis Green Chile Fried Chicken) and my friend got one of their specials, I believe shrimp& cheese. Their chips were so good like always and their food was good, too! We got our food real quick like in 15minutes. My friend liked her food, she said her shrimp was big and tasty! I tried my friend's food, it was pretty good but I liked mine better, honestly! My chicken was really good, fried perfectly, it was crispy outside but very warm& soft inside. And I got a lot of cheese on top of my chicken! I've only tried few menus at Chuy's but other people's salads and burritos looked really good, too. I definitely recommend this place! Parking kinda sucks just because there are many cars but it's not too bad.Overall, I like their interesting designs, pictures and atmosphere inside and their food & chips are so good! One of my favorites Mexican restaurants."
2015-08-16,5.0,"Newport News, VA",Abyssinia Ethiopian Restaurant,"I adore Ethiopian Cuisine and was thrilled to go to Abyssinia!  We ordered the Kitfo Combination, the Meat Combination and Vegetarian Combination.  It was some of the best I have had.   I go to Ethiopian restaurants as often as I can and I felt incredibly fortunate to find this place.  The Kitfo was superb, the Yebeg (lamb) Alicha had such an amazing depth of flavor, it was a favored item.  The Doro Wat was rich and delicious.  Our whole group was loving (what I think was) the Shiro (a green bean dish) which had the most wonderful flavor combinations.  The injera was perfection!  Ethiopian can be an acquired taste, but as one who  lives to find good Ethiopian cuisine, this place is a keeper!  The waitress was attentive, informative and beautiful (not needed for good service, but she added a lovely quality to the experience).  I loved that they had the original ways of serving the food if you wanted that option.  Lovely experience, can't wait to go back!!"
2015-08-16,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chuy’s,"While i'm not a huge man of Tex-Mex Chuy's does have something for everyone. While the main portion of the menu was standard burritos, tacos, enchiladdas, etc (aka nothing too revolutionary) I  really enjoyed their chips and queso and absolutely adored their tres leches cake....Note: It's HUGE and can feed three people (at least three girls) easy. Service is always spot on, even when they're slammed...Also they work hard to keep the restaurant itself clean it seems! Finally be sure to ask for a patio seat when it's nice! The space is huge and really nice,and if you're lucky you can catch a concert from your seat at Midtown Park!"

Driving in from an hour out to head to the airport and realize I have a ton of time to pass- and my subconscious suddenly tells me to look up a Donatos. It's a strongly Midwest and mostly Ohio chain, so I have no idea what made me look it up today. Success! I had literally just passed the exit that would take me there. A quick exit off the freeway and short few miles took me to my pizza paradise. Donatos I've missed you so since moving to Texas!!"

2015-08-16,5.0,"Zebulon, NC",Taste Small Plates | Wine Bar,"On Friday, 31 July my husband and I tried Taste at the recommendation of friends.  The food was awesome, as well as the wine selection.  We were looking forward to a return visit.  Before we ordered, the waiter told us about the $3 bottled beer special.  Based on the special, my husband ordered Duck Rabbit.  The waiter then said that ""Duck Rabbit was not included in the special"".  No problem- at that point my husband decided to get the Duck Rabbit anyway.  After finishing a wonderful meal, we received a check with the Duck Rabbit being listed as $13.00 for a 12 oz. bottle of beer!  WTH????  This can't be right!!!  It's Duck Rabbit made out of FarmVille, NC!  We asked to see a manager, who came out and told us the price was correct- that it was a 'special brew' for Duck Rabbit, which was BS!  He also stated that ""only bottled beers on the menu were included in the special"".  The bottled beers on the menu were between $6 - $8.  When you first walk into the restaurant the blackboard listed the $3 bottled beer special.  No where was it written that you were limited to beers on the menu.  We have dined at some fine dining restaurants and have NEVER paid more for a bottled beer than a glass of wine.  The 'manager' was unconcerned about our surprise and frankly didn't care that we were deceived.  If there is anyone out there who has paid more than than $8 for a bottle of Duck Rabbit as a restaurant, I'd love to know!  We paid the check because he drank the beer, but we will not be back!  We've never met a restaurant manager who was not concerned that we (the customer) were not happy, which is why I question whether he was really the manager.  As we were leaving I told the hostess ""please write on the blackboard that the special only includes bottled beers on the menu"".  She said she could not do that unless her manager told her to do so.  Like I said, we will not be back, which will not make the slightest bit of difference to their business.  If Taste choses not to be honest with you, I hope you read my review."
2015-08-16,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mandolin,"I knew that leaving Charleston was going to be hard from a food perspective, but I felt like I was right back in the Holy City as soon as I pulled up to Mandolin.  The restaurant is situated in a nice neighborhood setting with valet parking, Amen!  The interior was tastefully industrial.  We were greeted by a friendly Hostess who immediately took us to our seats (I had made reservations earlier in the week).  We promptly ordered drinks, my friend got wine, and I tried a ""peach cobbler.""  Now I don't know that it screamed peach cobbler, but was a good drink nonetheless.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable and friendly.  On to the first course, I selected the peaches with house made mozzarella, and my friend ordered the tuna crudo.  They were able to accommodate her gluten intolerance, which was much appreciated.  My peaches and mozz was delicious and beautifully presented, but somehow was lacking a little something.  I thought to myself, this dish would have been absolutely perfect had it been served with burrata as opposed to mozz.  Burrata is a fresh Italian cheese made from mozzarella and cream, and would have given a little more moisture to a somewhat dry dish.  The tuna crudo was delicious.  Dinner my friend selected the steak with sun chokes and I, the ribs.  Both were solid, but not blow your socks off good.  I'm happy to have such a lovely restaurant close by and will be back to try their fall creations."
2015-08-16,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",P.G. Werth’s,"Having been here 10 times and having nothing less than a 5-star experience, it seems this review is overdue. Located on Morgan near the intersection of Hillsborough, P.G. Werth's is conveniently located for everyone & has street parking as well as a small lot behind the restaurant. The dining room has many sizes of tables & outdoor seating too- they can easily accommodate large groups. They have breakfast, lunch, & dinner options each day of the week with drink specials Mon-Thurs, and their market is open at 630am Mon-Fri to conveniently grab coffee & food on the go.. and they're open for both sunday AND saturday brunch at 10am!!First and foremost, Chef Hamm is the sweetest restaurant owner I've met to date... his hospitality is second to none. Each dish on the menu has southern flair with tons of locally sourced ingredients- all of the homemade things are one of the many great things about P.G.Werth's :) they make everything in house- all juices are fresh squeezed, all salad dressings, jellies, ice creams- I could go on&on about the freshness of everything here!For brunch, I love the Grayson Highlands burger topped with jalapimento cheese with a side of chips & homemade ranch. My fav sweet brunch dishes are the moonflour french toast (stuffed with cream cheese & pear compote) or the chicken & waffles (sweet potato waffles with lightly handbreaded chicken). And, last but not least, the bottomless mimosas!! Need I say more?!The munch menu is full of savory things for both lunch & dinner, but Chef Hamm always has several daily specials too. I love the Oh my Cristo, an amazing sandwich with turkey, bacon, pork belly pastrami, havarti, mustard, & elderberry jam... wow, just wow. It's on both their brunch & munch menus, so you can get it anytime :) On Friday, one of Chef's specials was filet & squash kabobs on a stick of rosemary- the presentation was fabulous & tasted even better! Their Cheer & Pour menus are comrpised of coffee & alcoholic drinks. They use Larry's Beans and have many other local boozes too- 3 or 4 taps + wine & liquor.The servers take orders on iPads to minimize paper waste. When you're done, they bring them to your table to swipe your card tableside to avoid taking your card away from you. Don't let this be weird, it's for your safety! Tipping your server on the iPad is a bit awkward bc its tableside with the server right there & it only gives you 15, 20, & 22% options, but you can choose a custom tip too- be sure to give your service indrustry some love!All in all, I can't say enough praises about P.G.Werth's and what Chef Hamm is bringing to downtown Raleigh. He listens to each customer & reads every review, and he adapts his menu & environment to meet his customers' needs. How amazing :)  I truly hope you find the same love I have for this place too!"

2015-08-16,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gonza Tacos Y Tequila,"This place was great. The atmosphere is fun, loud, and kind of a riot. So, I ordered the Spicy Pepino for my beverage. It is a sweet cucumber cocktail with a kick. It was quite good. For my meal I ordered the chicken nachos. I have provided a picture. They were delicious. The only complaint that I have is that my stomach could hold no more food. This is a great place for a birthday party of adults. It is very loud and they come with instruments and play happy birthday. There are many types of tequila as the name implies. We were there for a birthday. I will say this, this is not a place to bring children at night. I can't speak for lunch. However I did not see any coloring papers and the three kids I did manage to see were unhappy with the noise level and could barley reach the tables. Most of the tables are standard size and I did not see any booster seats."

If you want a treat order a dog ""all the way"" which comes with mustard, chili and onions. You can also get a dog with coleslaw. To be honest, I have not tried one with slaw but I wife loves it (she doesn't like raw onions). We discovered on our last trip that the secret is to get a well done or burnt dog, adds an even better level of flavor. BUT, I warn you, BE PATIENT, you will get your food, just allow an artist to work. The Roast Grill is small but the patrons move in and out pretty quick. Just don't ask for Ketchup!!!"

2015-08-17,1.0,"Durham, NC",The Players Retreat,"i absolutely love... LOVE this place!  the only reason i'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because you can't smoke in there anymore.  stupid laws.  each of the bathrooms by the pool room are single occupancy, so you used to just be able to go in there with a nice pale ale, lock the door, sit down, and then light up a cigarette.  you can probably still do that, but recent smoking laws have kind of interfered with this whole experience."

I've dined in and had the lunch buffet, ordered entrees for dinner and had takeout. The quality, in my opinion has declined my last few tries. My recent takeout order consisted of chicken vindaloo, mushrooms & peas and an order of garlic naan. $36 dollars for 2 entrees and naan is pretty steep but if it tastes good, I won't complain. Well, it didn't taste good. I asked for my entrees extra spicy. They had heat from the cayenne pepper but otherwise the curries lacked flavor - and my vindaloo curry tasted like my mushroom & peas dish... the garlic naan was disappointing too - thin and burnt. The price, food quality and 90.5 health rating has made this my last attempt. Time for me to start cooking vindaloo at home."

The delivery was faster than quoted. Delivered hot! The dumplings were a soggy mess. The filling was minuscule, almost none inside. Picked it up and it was very limp and soggy. The broccoli w/garlic sauce indicated spicy on the menu but it was just regular brown sauce. No kick. The vegetable fried rice was a little greasy but full of yummy veggies that you don't normally see: snow peas and mushrooms. Add two sodas and my bill was $29. A little pricy for Chinese."

The meat sauce was good but nothing too incredible, and the pork meatballs were delicious, although a little too spicy for my girlfriend on their own. I didn't mind the spice, but I would highly recommend one of the sides under your balls or getting one of the sandwich options because 4 balls in sauce need something to something to take some of the flavor and soak up the sauce and one small piece of focaccia isn't quite enough. The mac and cheese was very good though. It was cheesy with nice al dente noodles and a good quantity of breadcrumbs on top. It was also a really big portion, and I probably wouldn't have finished that and 4 large meatballs if I wasn't starving when we arrived. My girlfriend ordered the spicy pork balls on a bun with Parmesan cream as her sauce and got the risotto of the day. Even though she got spicy pork meatballs as well, when covered with mozzarella and Parmesan cream they tasted a lot less spicy and were simply amazing. The Parmesan cream was definitely better than the meat sauce, and I enjoyed the meat sauce quite a bit. The brioche bun was buttery and extremely soft and honestly one of the best buns I've had anywhere. A+ sandwich. The risotto of the day had chorizo, tomatoes, and a ton of cheese. It was flavorful and pretty tasty, especially if you like cheese. I think it would've been great as one of the sides for under your meatballs."
2015-08-18,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Babylon Restaurant,"I chose this restaurant to celebrate two friends moving out of state. We decided to eat brunch then attend the day party that was advertised over Facebook. The interior decor is beautiful and there is plenty of seating. The outdoor patio is definitely the best in town. It does remind me of a few places in Chicago with great rooftop areas.When we arrivedw, there wasn't any clear direction of where the hostess typically greets you. I made the reservation on open table the week prior however when I went to check in I walked into a private party. Babylon was hosting a drag queen show and it was packed. We waited around a few minutes on the patio when the hostess greets us and tells us they wouldn't be able to honor our reservation for 1:30p indoors. She also informed us that she forgot to call ahead to alert us and the only option was to sit on the patio on a couch. It was 90 plus degrees and very uncomfortable outside but we were hungry!Eating on a couch was extremely difficult and several people in my party including myself spilled something on our clothes. We order the calamari, chicken bastilla, chicken and waffles, and the chicken skewers. Everything was delicious and cooked well.I would've gave Babylon 5 stars if it didn't take over 20minutes to get drinks and there wasn't a  mix up with the reservation."
2015-08-18,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",State of Beer,They have a great selection of beers that rotate frequently. Many if their beers are somewhat hard to find elsewhere. Raleigh has several excellent bottle shops and one thing that makes State of Beer stand out is that they have food. It's not run of the mill pub good either. They gave sandwiches and charcuterie plates that feature high quality meats and adventurous flavors. The ghost pepper salami is a must try! The other thing that makes them stand out is that the staff had excellent taste in music and they have a record player so that the tunes can be enjoyed on vinyl. The competition for best  bottle shop in raleigh is tough and it's hard for me to pick a favorite since they're all so good but State of Beer is definitely a strong contender!
2015-08-18,1.0,"Easton, Columbus, OH",Backyard Bistro,The place looks like an old Damon's.  Has the exact same setup with big TVs and sports memorabilia everywhere.  The food was good.  Definitely a good place to watch a game and pig out on some bar food.

2015-08-18,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Salt & Lime Cabo Grill,"4.5 starsWent to Salt and Lime for lunch yesterday with my sister in law. Upon entering, it is very clean and decorated nicely. We were seated reasonably soon, and our drink orders were taken. We were given the right amount of time to look over the menu,it's hard to decide from all the wonderful sounding dishes.I decided on the Fish Tacos (I'm on a mission to try every fish taco in every restaurant that serves them, LOL) and my sister in law got the Street Chicken. Let me tell you... when this food was brought to our table, it was BEAUTIFUL!  I don't take pictures of food all that often but this food was picture worthy. It was so pretty it was almost a shame to eat it, but eat we did, and it was just as delicious as it was beautiful. We are already planning to go back with the whole family sometime. Our server was very helpful and friendly. All the servers seemed to work together well. There's nothing pretentious about Salt and Lime, it's just a comfortable environment with a friendly staff and some pretty great food. Do yourself a favor and try it out."
2015-08-18,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mandolin,"I am very very happy to say that it looks like a lot of the previous issues I had with Mandolin have been fixed!  I've been twice since my initial review, and both times were fantastic.  The food is still (80%) hit or (20%) miss, but overall everything is very good.  They have options for heartier dishes like their ribs or chicken and waffles, but also provide at least 2-3 fish options that are perfectly cooked and light.My previous gripe was mainly about the service, which has vastly improved.  Everyone is incredibly courteous, helpful, and attentive.  The server offered up her favorite dishes, and more importantly, why she enjoyed them.I enjoyed my experience, and am very glad to be able to change my review!"
2015-08-18,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Hayes Barton Café & Dessertery,"I've been to Hayes Barton many times for dinner and cake, sometimes just for cake, and each time I've had an unbelievable experience.  The overall atmosphere of the diner has a very lovely vibe to it, and it's one of the best restaurants in Raleigh for date night, especially when there's a lot cake involved.  It's a small and cozy family run restaurant, and you will immediately feel they take a lot pride in treating their costumers with great food and service.  The food is best described as really good American classics with HUGE portion sizes!  The only thing I love more than good food is huge portions of good food.  You will not leave this place hungry, guaranteed.  For appetizers, the steamed mussels are some of the best I've had.  The sun dried tomato pesto broth is creamy and so flavorful.  The sun dried tomato is so prevalent and with the cheese and pesto, the broth is just amazingly good.  I could literally dip a whole a loaf of bread in that broth and eat it as my meal.  I would recommend ordering the ""small"" size for two people because it still comes out to about 50 mussels.  For entrees, the meatloaf is really good and huge, which is the theme of all their portion sizes.  It's a giant, thick cut piece of meatloaf that's so tender and moist.  The brown gravy is also a great compliment, and the buttery mashed potatoes and green beans round out the meal.  You can't go wrong with the meatloaf, their signature dish.  I've also had the two chickens pot pie, which is also enormous.  There are two thick layers of shredded chicken covered in a delicious gravy sauce with a thick layer of mash potatoes, peas, and carrots sandwiched in between.  It really reminded me of Thanksgiving.  All of the vegetables were perfectly cooked, and the pie shell it came in was really good, not dry at all.  Even after taking half of it home, the pie crust was still good the next day.  I've also tried the crab cakes, which were a very generous size with a good amount of crab meat.  The filet mignon here is also amazingly tender.  Literally melts in your mouth.  It was so tender I didn't even use the steak knife they gave me, the butter knife easily cut right through.  The filet came with a tomato cheese pie, basically a deep dish pizza with a ton of fresh tomato and cheese inside.Even if you're completely stuffed, you must order cake.  You cannot leave Hayes Barton without trying the cake.  For about $9, you get the biggest slice of some of the best and biggest cake you'll ever see at a restaurant for dessert.  Every time I get cake, it lasts me about another 3 desserts.  I would highly recommend the Kahlua, raspberry chocolate, and flourless chocolate torte.  You also can't go wrong with red velvet, carrot, or tiramisu as well.  The apple pie cake is a little different in that there's not really cake, but a thick layer of apples with an apple crisp topping.  Overall, I love coming to Hayes Barton and have never been disappointed leaving here, except when they sell out of the cake I want.  But there are so many options, you'll ultimately end up leaving satisfied."

Use to be a huge fan of bonefish when I lived in Tampa Florida. Not even close to the same. What a shame. I was looking forward to bringing 50+ people here for dinner over the next few months. I'm thinking I'm going to have to find another place. Smh"
2015-08-18,2.0,"Gastonia, NC",Garland,"From the awesome reviews on here I knew I'd have to try it, but I still couldn't really imagine how Indian/Korean fusion food would taste. Well, it tastes great! I got the pork bowl to go, so I can't comment on waiters/environment, but the food itself was outstanding. It had flavors I've never experienced before. On saying that--they were very strong and rich flavors, so not something you could have everyday! Make sure to ask for a fork with your to-go order, or you'll be stuck trying to eat this huge dish with little wooden chopsticks like me. haha"
2015-08-18,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Oak City Meatball Shoppe,"Visited with my work posse for lunch this week. It is clear on the other side of downtown for us, but we were willing to make the trek because (1) it was restaurant week, and who WOULDN'T walk six blocks to save two bucks on the combo? and (2) If you are eating meatballs in delicious sauce for lunch, you better walk that far to cut into that calorie surplus, right? They have five or six regular meatball choices, five or six sauce choices, together with 5 or 6 bases or sides you can have with the meatballs (detect a pattern here?)  They also had a special meatball (jambalaya, the day I went), sauce (creole, presumably to go with the jambalaya meatballs), and side, which I assume changes every day. Four meatballs with sauce are $8, and the side is an additional $4, but for restaurant week they were doing the whole thing for ten bucks.  I got all three of the daily specials (the meatball, the sauce, and the side, which was a risotto with andouille sausage).  I hate it when Cajun restaurants overdo it with the spiciness, so the light seasoning was just right for me. One of my companions got the vegetarian meatballs with some kind of white sauce, and they really looked delicious as well (they actually had pieces of broccoli in them, rather than being some sort of unidentifiable fake meat stuff).  All in all, a pretty tasty and relatively good-valued lunch experience."

2015-08-19,4.0,"Willow Spring, NC",Garland,"Great food, horrible service. My husband and I went for our anniversary. We could care less about the trendy atmosphere and clientele, we wanted good food and we waited forever after ordering. Our waitress took our order and then disappeared into the kitchen with her iPhone, never to return. Our food was brought to us much, much later by the apologetic chef. Our waitress never checked on us to refill water or drinks or to see if we needed any extras. I complained to management. As I left, the waitress came out and comped drinks to the tables surrounding us, who were ignored as well. The food was good but not worth the wait. The inattentive staff still has a lot to learn. Go when you have time to sit around and wait, and wait. Be prepared to be ignored,even if you need CPR, I mean salt, or pepper."
2015-08-19,4.0,"Cary, NC",Flying Saucer Draught Emporium,"We went here for my husband's birthday lunch since he enjoys beer.  He ordered a NC flight with Duck Rabbit Milk stout, Big Boss Bad Penny, Green Man IPA, Island Gaelic Ale and Lone Rider Shotgun Betty - he enjoyed the Ale the most.  We had buffalo tender snack which was average and big pretzels which were hot and tasty.  I had a kale salad which would have been nice massaged but had pumpkin seeds and a delicious vinaigrette.  Ever cheese soup was delicious but made me wondered if they watered down the queso. Beer cheese soup I've had before had a bit of potato and tasted more of beer.  Daughter had the kick Ass Chicken sandwich which was well are but the sauce lacked taste considering it had jalapeños and pesto in it.  Service was great and the food came out super fast.  The place pretty empty but being it was 2:30 in the afternoon,  that's not surprising. I'd go back."

2015-08-20,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Person Street Pharmacy,Eh sorry ..but the old style pharmacy was way better stocked . Dropped in to get some bobby pins and now they have very little selection and everything is displayed almost white cube style . I understand you have 80 types of toothbrushes and two lint rollers that need half a foot of shelf space .. And now local greeting cards you can buy in pretty much every other hip boutique or store downtown. Boring !!!This cafe  looks like every other cafe in Raleigh and I was pretty amused at the $8 hotdog . You could come here and get a grilled cheese and soup or a chicken salad sandwich for $4 before whole enjoying the genuine vintage interior . What a shame . Good job ruining a piece of preserved local history .
2015-08-20,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mura,"Better than the last. We left it to the server to piece together our meal... and it was perfect. Toro, Australian Wild Salmon, and a lot of other interesting and uncommon sashimi made it fun and exciting. I tried a fried shrimp head, too! The SinCity roll was good, and there was another roll that was wrapped in a fried shredded potato... which was really textural and delicious. We ate in one of the side rooms that allows for more privacy. I'd totally recommend."
2015-08-20,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Plates Neighborhood Kitchen,"Well Plates definitely deserves an updated review!! Wow crazy that's it's been almost two years since my first visit here. Well I have been to Plates a handful of times now and have to say it's now one of my favorite restaurants in Raleigh. My last two visits in particular were outstanding.There bread, cheese plate, and fish dishes are just incredible. I love all the fresh ingredients they use in their dishes. The portion size is perfect and the price is just right.  I came out for Downtown Raleigh Restaurant Week #DRRW and was not disappointed. Restaurant week can always surprise me, I really hope Plates considers putting some of these dishes on their normal menu.  Did I mention Plates dinner menu is just $20 for #DRRW this was a freakin' steal.Norma G and I started out with some yummy wine and the mushroom and grits, and cheese plate. I already knew I loved Plates cheese plate the one they offer on their full menu is one of the best I've had in the Triangle. Now those mushrooms and grits, folks you don't want to miss out on this dish. If you are a mushroom love like myself you are going to be in heaven with one bite of this appetizer. Next up were entree's I took a bite of Norma's trout and it was delicious I decided to order the short ribs and I'm so glad I did. That sauce that was with the short ribs was so good I could have licked the plate. The peach tarte and chocolate mousse were also dreamy and you can't go wrong with their signature sticky toffee pudding.Plates food never disappoints and it's turning into my go to restaurant to bring my friends from out of town, it's always consistent. Let's be honest the atmosphere is pretty fantastic too! That outdoor patio is one of the best on Glenwood South! You still have time for restaurant week don't miss it!"

Our server was great and knew everything about the menu. Overall I really was not impressed with the food, it was average. We had the mahi mahi and the brisket. I know this is a seafood place and you should try seafood there not meat but our server recommended it. The food wasn't bad it was just average. Our server told us only one of the things on the restaurant week menu was on the actual menu. Maybe we'll go back and try an entree that's on the actual menu."
2015-08-20,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Oak City Meatball Shoppe,"Oak City Meatball just does meatballs, but they do it really really well.  I was expecting to get a typical dish of meatballs with pasta like any other Italian restaurant, but I was surprised at the quality and care they put into crafting their meatballs.  I got the traditional Italian meatballs with red sauce over risotto, and it was absolutely delicious.  You get four giant, hand crafted meatballs that are cooked perfectly.  They were very tender and moist on the inside, and you taste all the Italian seasonings and spices they mix into the meat.  The red sauce is really good, very tasty and refreshing.  The risotto was cooked really well and had a creamy texture with just the right consistency.  It wasn't soggy or over done at all.  I also tried the side of mac and cheese, and it also had a very creamy cheese sauce like Velveeta.  The cheese was smooth, and tasted great.  They use thick rigatoni noodles and sprinkle bread crumbs on top, making it a very filling and good side to complement your meatballs.     Overall, I was thoroughly pleased with my meal at Oak City Meatball.  I would rather order a plate of meatballs and pasta here ($8 meatballs + $4 side) over many other Italian restaurants in the Raleigh area.  You get a big portion size, and you also get amazing quality.  I will definitely come back and look forward to trying some of their meatball daily specials."
2015-08-20,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",First Watch,"I have eaten here twice and the food with fine, nothing special, but then I ordered standard breakfast fare.  I have two reasons for my rating, neither to do with food, but general service/management.  When I was here on a Sunday morning a couple of weeks ago, I ordered the traditional breakfast, with eggs easy-over.  When I noticed a yellowy orange splotch on the corner of my plate, I figured it must be some of the yolk that had broken.  As I ate more, and moved the egg around, there was a much bigger yellowy-orange splotch, which turned out to be melted cheese.  Nothing in my meal included cheese.  When I pointed this out to my server, he apologized, but just said, ""yeah, they must have spilled some cheese, but the plate is clean. ""  At this point I was nearly finished with my meal, so I didn't ask for any replacement, etc., and none with offered.  When I paid my check, the very bored and dismissive cashier asked me how everything was.  When I told her about the messy plate, her response was a very dull ""oh, I'm sorry"" with a flick or her hair and no eye contact.  When I asked if there was a manager I could talk to (just to make them aware of the situation), I was told no.  Now for a place that serves breakfast/brunch/lunch, you'd think a manager would be present on a Sunday morning.  My second reason is something that happened on both my visits, but is a general complaint and happens consistently in a lot of places I have eaten. When I told the host/hostess that there is ""just one"" they proceeded to lead me to the back corner of the restaurant.  Both times I asked and was given a different seating location.  As I am usually a solo diner, I experience this frequently.  Hey, restaurants, ""nobody puts baby in..."" you know how it goes, just show a little more consideration to the solo diners, there are a lot of us out here."

When we arrive in time for our appointed reservation we were rudely told that because we had my son we could not be seated because this is a ""fine dining"" restaurant. We have been to much more, five star, fine dining restaurants in New York like per se and Daniels, which were much more crowded than this half empty place, and never been turned away with our son. All the other finer dining restaurants knew how to treat children well.

2015-08-21,4.0,"Apex, NC",Tazza Kitchen Cameron Village,"We come here pretty often and it's always spot on. Tonight we got something old and tried some new things. Instead of my Moscow mule, I decided, per our awesome waiter's suggestion, to opt for a Kentucky Mule which is the same just with bourbon instead of vodka. It was quite tasty and still had that ginger beer punch but with a smooth, southern quality. For a starter we did the poppy Caesar which is a really well-executed version of a traditional Caesar. However, the lackluster romaine is replaced with a beautiful rainbow chard, the Parmesan with gran padano and beautiful brown butter croutons. The dressing is clearly made in-house and is light but flavorful. You will scrape the plate for every dressing covered shred of gran padano! Mark my word. For our entrees, we got our regular spicy sausage and black pepper honey and we also tried the three meat. Let me just say that the sausage and honey NEVER disappoints. The honey melds so well with the sausage in a way that's truly above the status quo. They have a similar spicy sweet pairing with the three meats. It's topped with a carrot slaw which creates a perfect balance of flavors. This is no ordinary pizza my friends. This is premium-ingredient, farm-fresh amazingness. The meal was great from start to finish."
2015-08-21,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Rockford,"I chose the Rockford for a late lunch last week because of a sparkling review of vegetarian restaurants on the internet that I found.  Unfortunately the review (I later determined) was four years old and the Rockford no longer offered any of the entrees that were discussed (like the lentil sandwich or vegetable soup).  In fact, they currently don't have any soup at all on their menu, and only a single vegetarian entre (beet sandwich which sounded gross).  The waiter (who was handling the entire restaurant single-handedly including the bar) was also not helpful.  (""What are your vegetarian options?"" ""Well any salad without meat.""  ""What is this friend romaine like?"" ""We just fry up the lettuce."")  I wound up choosing the Greek Salad because it was one of the few things I could eat. But OMG, it was the best Greek salad I ever had.  Very small and overpriced at $8 or whatever it was, but that fried romaine was crispy and tasty and the dressing was fantastic.  The olives were very good and the feta cheese just outstanding.  Well worth the trip just for the salad.  I can only imagine what the previous vegetarian entrees were like that are no longer served.  The waiter also allowed me to get a 1/2 size appetizer of pita and hummus for $6, which I really appreciate and which many places will not do.  Both were outstanding.  The pita was fluffy and warm and better than any pita I have gotten at the alleged middle eastern restaurants in town.  The hummus was heavy on olive oil but just the right amount of spice, creamy and outstanding.  Just wonderful. The service was good despite the lack of assistance with the menu, although I felt rushed during the entire stay.  I didn't know about the outdoor seating or would have chosen it.  The ambience is cozy and interesting.  I definitely plan to go back, notwithstanding the minimal menu.  What they do offer, they know how to make."

2015-08-21,1.0,"Lillington, NC",Shuckers Oyster Bar & Grill,"We came here for restaurant week and it was such a good deal for the price. It came with an appetizer, soup or salad, entree with a side and dessert! I'm stuffed as I write this review and I have leftovers to last for days! Appetizers: I got the bacon scallops which were huge! The bacon kind of overpowered the scallops and some of them were like double wrapped with bacon which made it super bacon-y. My friend hated them tho but she doesn't like seafood. She said it was like eating a chunk of fat. The ahi tuna was really good tho. I'd get that next time I came back. I also got to try the Rockefeller oysters which were alright. I prefer raw oysters. I got the sea chowder which was delicious. I love soup! It came with shrimp and Who knows what other seafood. The restaurant was a bit dim so I couldn't really see what else was in it. HahaEntrees: I got the the stuffed mahi which was alright. Kind of disappointing as that's one of their signature dishes but I'm glad I tried it. It was different. The fish was a bit dry but mixed with the crab cake made it better. There was also a 5oz filet and crab legs which looked good. The crab was fresh. My friend ordered the filet medium rare but it came out more of a medium well. I guess you can't expect too much since they're known for their seafood. It was actually a really flavorful steak but I'm sure it would have been better actually cooked medium rare. The ribs looked really good and my friend almost finished her whole plate! Finger licking good. seriously. Desserts: key lime pie was really lime-y. It reminded me of a cheesecake type texture. Some of my friends loved it and some thought it had too much lime in it. I got the brownie with ice cream on it and I finished all of it even tho I was stuffed! Can't let good dessert go to waste! My other friend got the bread pudding not on the restaurant week menu but she said it was orgasmic. Overall this place is nice for a date night or a girls outing. It looked like they had a pretty good happy hour so I might come back to check that out. I do like how they have call ahead seating. It did start to get kind of busy around 7:30ish. It was nice how the manager came by to check on us too. She even gave us some coupons for free appetizers. She probably knew I was going to write this yelp review with all the picture taking I was doing! Hahha. So I'll be back for that. And their happy hour!"
2015-08-21,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Ni Asian Kitchen,"Stopped in for quick dinner and had sweet and sour chicken. Its was great the batter was unbelievably crisp (it crunched), chicken tasty, sauce just right and vegetables fresh.  Brown rice was good as well - good quality too. There was easily enough for two meals for me.Staff were kind and attentive. Asked for separate to go meals to be prepped at same time as my food and was advised his manager may come to confirm as they  normally would make towards end of meal. She came to let me know it may get cold and I said that is really ok was going to be reheated anyway. Seats maybe 30 people but nice atmosphere will definitely be adding to my meals out rotation!"
2015-08-22,4.0,"Willow Spring, NC",Shish Kabob,"Love this place. Food is great & staff is always nice. Not authentically Greek. Just Mediterranean, which is fine, the food is fresh. Just wish there was inside seating & a customer restroom. Otherwise it would've been a 5 star."
2015-08-22,4.0,"Huntington, WV",O’Malley’s Pub & Restaurant,"Walked in and immediately left. I don't know if they were having a special that day for middle aged men with midlife crises going on, but there were a lot sitting out on the patio heckling and staring at anyone walking by. I don't understand why they couldn't just sit there and enjoy their own company and food. Anyways, I figured this would have a more restaurant atmosphere at 5 in the evening, but it really appeared more as a dive bar. Again, it was like everyone is just staring at you like ""what are you doing here?"" Also, the place didn't look the cleanest, and nobody was there to greet you. I was really hoping for some good food, beer and a place I could bring my out of state friends to when they came to visit, but I felt really unwelcome."
2015-08-22,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Moonlight Pizza Company,"To start i would give this place 4.5, because the pizza is definitely worth it. My issue is i came in and was uncomfortably hot which is unfortunate, but they have some great deals worth it. I got half off apps and the calamari is great! It is crispy, great flavor on breading and the aioli and chipotle marinara is stupid good. The wings were decent naked,but good just basic kind of wings. Now for the pizza, my go to is pepperoni and bacon and did me justice for sure. I loved the crust and everything about the pizza. It is not the best i have had, but is damn sure good and worth the trip. At the end of the day although i think my bahama mama was forgot about at the end. The staff was super friendly and courteous and realized they forgot my drink but it didnt bug me as it can happen. Solid pizza, good service, and a good drink. Highly recommend this place as a sweet Raleigh staple."
2015-08-22,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Monapita Mediterranean Grill,Ive been to a lot of great restaurants all around the world and I've been able to enjoy a variety of food from all kinds of cultures and that helps when being able to define authenticity and let me say MONA PITA  is authentic as your going to get in Raleigh when it comes to middle Eastern cuisine. The food is so clean and filling it makes you want to try everything its better than fast food  in the healthy category and price wise its your average 6 to 12 bucks and that's for quality clean food!! When it comes to customer service this family owned business truly exceeds the meaning of great they are very nice and welcoming always makes you feel at home or relaxed. I could go on and on about how great this restaurant is but until you go you'll never truly know. Recommended dishes/ my favorites -  LAMG GYRO PLATE OR SANDWICH WITH FRIES STEAK SUB COMBO MIXED MEAT PLATE CHICKEN KABOB PLATE
2015-08-22,4.0,"Fayetteville, NC",Hayes Barton Café & Dessertery,The cake was delicious. Ordered to go so not too sure about anything else. Would definitely go back if I'm ever in that area.
2015-08-22,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Humble Pie,"An absolute favorite in Raleigh. I come here every time I come home. Rosie is an incredible server, and the chef goes out of his way to make sure you are getting exactly what you want! Humble Pie never disappoints!"
2015-08-22,5.0,"Montreal, Canada",Black Cat Cafe,I agree with another reviewer that the staff treat you like a burden.  I went in one afternoon at 2:30 and was very quickly informed that they would be closing at 3 but that I could come back at 5:00.  Bad first impression and certainly my last visit to this restaurant.
2015-08-22,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bahama Breeze,"TERRIBLE place. I had a friend that applied to be a server here and she had two interviews. She said the first interview it took 35 minutes after her appointment for them to see her. It took an hour for the second interview! After all that she wasn't even hired, and I agreed to never go here in solidarity with her. Weeks later I was with two friends. One suggested going here and I didn't remember my friend's bad experience till I was already there. It was lunch time and there was barely anyone there, and it took over 20 minutes before we were even acknowledged by anyone. The waitress made it clear she was not fond of being there, and pretty soon we all felt the same way. The food was subpar at best and was either too overcooked or undercooked nothing in between. I didn't get a single refill. It had to have taken about 25 minutes for us to get our checks back. What's with this place and time? I certainly won't be going back, for real this time."
2015-08-22,2.0,"Houston, TX",18 Seaboard,"We ate at this restaurant for restaurant week and ordered two cocktails, for appetizer was gazpacho and fried okra the main course was brisket and mahi mahi and dessert was chocolate cake and creme Brulé. To start with the good... the cocktails were two thumbs up and the chocolate cake was delicious. However the restaurant was freezing cold, so cold that we were very uncomfortable throughout the entire dinner.  They seemed to be overbooked because we had reservations and still waited 20 minutes to be seated. Both of our appetizers were very substandard for a place that is supposed to be above average. They ran out of mahi mahi and substituted some other fish.  The portion size is very small for the price.  The crème brûlée was also not very tastyWe were overall very disappointed with our experience at this restaurant and will not be visiting again"
2015-08-22,5.0,"Coachella, CA",Gino’s Pizza,This place has amazing pizza iv eaten at a lot of pizza places this place has the best pizza I have ever eaten
2015-08-22,5.0,"West Palm Beach, FL",Neomonde Bakery & Deli,"As always, excellent and fast service- even when crowded - and huge assortment of food including the most mouthwatering desserts you can imagine! Their pastries and homemade pita are to die for; the vegetable lasagna is a must and my favorite sides are the orzo salad and the mujdara."
2015-08-22,5.0,"Chantilly, VA",Sassool,"This is the best Lebanese place ever! Lots of fresh variety. I hit this joint up about once a week. Great friendly staff. The Kafta, falafel, lasagne, salads etc. the baklava and cookies are also wonderful. I would highly recommend this place to anyone in Raleigh. They also have a grocery area with cool spices, syrups and breads. Check this out if you haven't."
2015-08-23,4.0,"Durham, NC",Babylon Restaurant,"I went to Babylon last night.  The ambiance is amazing, however the service was unreal.  It was horrible.  Our waitress seemed new but I can't be sure.  She was working behind the bar and waitressing our table which seemed a bit odd for a saturday night.  It got increasingly busy as the night went on which was apparent.  She spilled ice on my feet and on my date's pants.  She then did not clean up the ice so there was puddles of water around our table.  Then, there must have been a mix up with our food because several tables around us received the same plates before us.  When my plate came out, the food was cold.  I told the waitress who then had them heat it up again and my food was still cold.  It was so bad that I ripped off a piece of my chicken and had the waitress touch it.  After telling me that she would comp my meal she the came back and said that she could only take off half after talking to her manager.  She did offer free dessert which was one scoop of icecream =(. Upon leaving we asked her about outside seating to get hookah.  You would think after all of this, she would have tried to assist.  She directed us to a couch only to have no server approach us for service.  When we told someone we wanted to get hookah, they took forever to come so we just left.  This is a great place to go and have a drink but the service is literally the worst."
2015-08-23,5.0,"Durham, NC",Vivace,"Great casual atmosphere with an upscale feel. The menu had a lot of varied food items and unique ingredients. Bring an Italian translator for some of the menu items, it's that authentic. We went on a Sunday evening and it was not crowded at all. It is not a noisy restaurant and it was easy to have a conversation. The waitstaff was professional and attentive and the open styled exhibition kitchen made it interesting to watch the chefs create your meals. I would definitely go to this restaurant again and I am looking forward to their new restaurant opening in Durham."
2015-08-23,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kabab and Curry,"INDIAN BUFFET, need I say more! Well, I guess I should elaborate a little further. Kabab and Curry is an intimate little establishment located on Hillsborough street. The decor is pleasing and fancier than you would expect on Hillsborough. They also have a bar area. The lunch buffet is from 11:30am - 3pm.  The current price was around $12 (an amazing deal for Indian food!). Though the name is kabab and curry, it seemed as though their lunch buffet consisted of familiar Indian dishes and no kababs. None the less, they had a great selection. On the day I went, there were 12 large kettles including rice, vegetable dishes, chicken dishes, and a rice & goat dish. In addition there was a little salad selection, rice pudding, and naan (plain and garlic). I thought ALL the chicken dishes were spectacular. I enjoyed every bite and left stuffed to the brim. I am so excited to have found this place, I will be back soon!"
2015-08-23,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sosta Café,The owner is completely wonderful and helpful.Great place for an afternoon pick-me-up in the form of coffee or a sweet treat. I've never had a bad experience here.
2015-08-23,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Black Cat Cafe,"My wife and I own a small restaurant not too far from the Black Cat Cafe. One of our customers/friends ( who coincidently manages a local restaurant) has been telling us to try the BCC for the longest time. With so many excellent choices in Raleigh, we didn't make it to the black cat for too long. That all changed last night. WoW. What a find. We could not have been more satisfied with every aspect of our visit. There was plenty of parking available. Before you can get to the front door you are already enjoying the ambience of the patio. The trees and shrubs surrounding the patio are very tastefully decorated with lights. From the moment that you walk through the front door you are greeted by very delightful, unique environment. Each staff member that we encountered greeted us with a nice attitude and a smile. The menu is unbelievable. There were so many things that we wanted to try we ended up with one appetizer and three entrées one of which was a salad. We had to force ourselves to not eat everything just so that we could enjoy some leftovers at the house in a day or two.  We ordered the hummus served with vegetables. Their special touch with the red pepper and perhaps some spices? Had us licking the bowl clean. We ordered one of their grilled chicken salads and substituted their ""chick-less"" chicken. Let's just say the salad did not make it to the togo box. The ""chic-less"" chicken pot pie was decadent. The eggplant parmesan ( which is my jam) was so damn good it was scary. We had a craft beer (watermelon) and an americano coffee done right. It took every little bit of strength that we had not to order a dessert or a cookie. We were told by our friend that the peanut butter pie is something that cannot be missed.and they do breakfast on the weekends!        What....We plan on going back often.Well......since the above review we have been back to the BCC two more times for a total of three visits. Our second visit was with another couple and we ordered what seemed like most of the menu. The third stop was just my wife and me. At no point have we had anything other than amazing foods and flavors.For each of our 3 visits we had the same server. TETYANA. What a lovely pleasant young lady. Tetyana is very knowledgable, patient, funny, and easy going.We look forward to seeing Tetyana as much as we look forward to our next meal at the BCC."
2015-08-23,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Humble Pie,"Humble Pie is our favorite place to go girls night. The chef is excellent and has come out to our table on two occasions to bring us extra small plates to try! We usually order three or four small plates to share and have never ordered something we don't like! Last night the cornmeal fried shrimp and the blue crab claws were my favorites!! The service is also outstanding. Although we go for girls night, but this was be an Excellent place for a date, especially if you make a reservation for seeing outside. Must have: Amazing almond flour chocolate cake (gluten free!)"
2015-08-23,5.0,"Fort Bragg, NC",Tazza Kitchen Cameron Village,"Met my expectations and then some!!! One thing to note...I felt the crowd was a little pretentious for my liking but other than that everything was excellent including the service. We sat inside, the chairs/tables are a little small but you can manage.Food wise....the menu is small but specialized, combos that you may never think about. For example, we had the sausage and honey pizza. The size of the pizza is like a small with very thin crust. Easily tackled by one person. The taste was heavenly!! Everything flowed perfectly together including the nice crisp crust, delish! Also had the chicken tacos w/ a side of watermelon. The tacos were very complex, taste wise. You could tell that there were a lot of flavors but they came together perfectly. The watermelon had a splash of oj with mint and cheese, intriguing as it was it worked as well. Just a piece of advice....call ahead to get your name on the list! We went on a Saturday at 7, when I called it was a 25min wait....took us 20mins to get there...walked in and our table was ready! Enjoy!"
2015-08-23,5.0,"Durham, NC",The Flying Biscuit Café,"My friend, along with her son who is just a year old, went here on Saturday around 12noon. The hostess was great and we sat outside for about 20 minutes waiting for our table. We were seated and promptly greeted  by our server and drink order was taken. Our buscuit took longer than usual to come out, but they were worth the wait! The apple butter/biscuit combo is out of this world! I ordered the eggs over medium on a biscuit with the chicken gravy(idk what it was actually called). I'd hate to say it, it wasn't all that memorable of a meal. Our server was decent-pleasant, sociable, and great with my friends son, but when the time came to check out she was no where to be found!"
2015-08-23,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Assaggio’s,"Interesting place. I'm not sure about the atmosphere, we didn't really feel cozy or relaxed. The food was pretty good except for the salad. It looked not fresh. Average place with average food. Good place for a quick stop."
2015-08-23,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Big Al’s BBQ,"This is my first time here and it went terrible. I had a high expectation for this place. I would never go here for ribs. Maybe for something else but certainly, not ribs. The ribs is fresh but dry and spicy. It's not tangy, if that's what you're expecting. It's not fall off the bone type of ribs. I asked for extra sauce and when I received mine, it's sauce-less. On a moist scale, it's a 2. I don't recommend this place for ribs."
2015-08-23,5.0,"Durham, NC",Winston’s Grille,"Great service, good food. Tasty burger and club sandwich. Found it while out on an errand and will keep it in mind when we are over this way again."
2015-08-23,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chopstix Gourmet and Sushi Bar,"We love this place. Tonight's review is strictly based on their ethics. I placed an order for carryout, as we always do. I had an entertainment coupon for a free entree up to$10 off. I mentioned the coupon when I placed the order. I guess that was my fault. The owner charged me $2 extra per meal we ordered, a $2 delivery fee then just subtracted $10 off my bill. Instead of adjusting it on the computer. After I left I'm sure she did. You see, I was charged the tax on that$10 also. After the coupon I was still charged $18 for 2 dinners which is always $19.60. These Chinese people are not only rude and cheap but dishonest. The food is fantastic but the dishonesty is a huge turnoff. Won't be going back. There are others to patronage."
2015-08-23,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Irregardless Cafe & Catering,"While it is impressive that Irregardless Cafe has been around for 40 years, I was not super impressed with my evening out for dinner during Triangle Restaurant Week.I have been here previously for breakfast and I had a seafood omlet. I remember it was very tasty and also very rich. My expectation for dinner was to be the same: delicious, rich, comfort food. I ordered the vegan eggplant moussaka and the appearance alone was a turn off. It was block shaped and smothered in tomato sauce. All I could taste was tomato sauce and the eggplant was entirely hidden. My main entree was a let down but I did like the appetizer, especially since you got all three that were listed for restaurant week for either the meat or vegetarian option. However, I wish the waiter would have mentioned that earlier so I did not spend all that time deciding, for apparently no reason. The coconut cake was okay but I would not get it again. I did taste the flourless chocolate cake and it was very good. I appreciate their farm to table practice. On a chalk board in the dining area they list all the produce and herbs that they obtain from the Community garden and Kellam-Wyatt farm and it feels great to know where the food is coming from and that we are supporting the local community. I like the layout and decor. If they have been in the same location for 40 years, I think they have done well on maintaining the building and keeping it up to date. I like the seating arrangement in that they have both booths and plenty of tables. They often have live music which is unique."
2015-08-23,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gino’s Pizza,"I come in here every so often for their all-day special (2 slices with 1 topping each & a drink for $6). Not many places sell pizza by the slice in Raleigh. This place is kind of a hole in the wall but service is always great and seating is roomy. Oh yeah and the pizza is great! A little crispy underneath, tasty sweet sauce and good cheese. That is a NY style pizza."
2015-08-23,4.0,"Eastchester, NY",Shuckers Oyster Bar & Grill,Change the name to Schmuckers cause that's how I felt leaving this place.  Don't bother with reservations--you are only added to the walk in list and given a beeper.  The hostesses (or the 3 stooges) need training--they allowed groups of diners to cut in front of others patiently waiting by grabbing open tables.  During my hour wait I saw no one getting food but only groups leaving in frustration or asking to see the manager.  Just because you watch foodtv doesn't mean you can run a restaurant.
2015-08-24,5.0,"Holly Springs, NC",42nd Street Oyster Bar & Seafood Grill,"It's always cool to come to an iconic restaurant.  When my mother was alive she insisted coming here for the oysters as that was her favorite food and I would say this restaurant is the BEST place to get those and their oyster bar service is bar none the best as I have been drug to everyplace in the triangle Area.  =)  I don't eat oysters so yes I say that with some drudgery.  But 42nd deserves accolades for that. I've had the fried seafood here before and it's fine.I've had their seafood soups/ stews that have changed in flavors and they were all good.Their hushpuppies are standard but good and fresh.  I enjoy them.Last night I got there early (they serve food at 5pm and I was there at 4:30).  The parking lot was empt so I called from the car.  They said the lounge was open and to come on in.  A sign would  have been nice on the outside for dorks like me.  I realized I'd never sat in the lounge here before.  I have always had a reservation and was ushered to a table.  The lounge reminded me of the old bars in the 70's my mom used to work in.  Extremely heavy barstools with ""leather"" seats that I kept almost slipping off of.  =)  Very dark interior.  Lots of framed photos of stuff I don't recognize and a very long wooden bar. Very nostalgic but genuine - not like the places that try to recreate that look.  The bartender was attentive and friendly but unobtrusive. I ordered a glass of wine and he let me have a taste before pouring which never happens at restaurant bars so I was impressed.Once my party arrived we got an ""island"" at the oyster bar so my sister could have her steamed oysters.  We toasted mama with some beers and munched on the very hot hushpuppies that appeared out of nowhere while we were chatting.Her half peck of steamed oysters were very good.  A couple were overcooked and she had asked for medium but that happens.  Our friend got the surf and turf of crab legs and filet.  The crab legs were beautiful but the filet looked really dry to me.  She ordered it medium and it was cooked correctly but watching her cut it (sawing it) told me I did not need to order steak here.  She did not comment either way. It came with a steamed squash medley which she did not want and I gladly ate - it was just steamed no flavor of any kind.  That's ok.  a little hot sauce fixed that.I ordered the fried green tomatoes with pimento cheese and shrimp.  There were 5 on the plate and no side dish.  A salad would have been nice.  But you have to order that a la carte.  It was good.  Nothing to rave about.  The shrimp was a good size.  It was AOK but again nothing that made me ooh and ahh. There was nothing really wrong with it either.We had ordered the crab and artichoke dip but it came out after the entrees.  It was the highlight.  VERY crabby in a good way.  Very little artichoke but maybe they were creamed in there?  None of us liked that the pita was deep fried.  They were greasy.  I took half of the dip home. So for nostalgia on many levels I'm glad I came and I would NOT refuse to come if invited for a special occasion like this one.  However, although I've been here over 25 times in the past, it's not someplace that would be on my top 10 to come to.  For the money there are so many other options in the triangle area."
2015-08-24,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Oakwood Café,"The empanadas were deep fried.  I've had some that weren't cooked like that.  I had a chicken empanada that was OK.  The spinach and cheese had no taste to it, I had to drown it in hot sauce.  The black beans were OK.  I live in NW Raleigh.  I don't think I would come down here just for this restaurant.  I came with some coworkers for lunch.Despite the cuisine, the waitresses do not appear to speak Spanish.  So much for using my limited tourist Spanish.  LOL."
2015-08-24,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Frank’s Pizza & Italian Restaurant,"Tucked away on the side of Longview Shopping Center.....

2015-08-24,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mellow Mushroom,"I've never actually been a huge fan of Mellow Mushroom. I don't really like their pizza (I'm more of a Brixx or Ruckus pizza gal) but after playing tennis yesterday, I was outvoted about which restaurant to visit. ;) All the other girls at my table ordered salad and kept gushing about how amazing their salads are so I decided to order the Greek salad and add shrimp...And boy did Mellow Mushroom prove me wrong! The salad was downright amazing. I absolutely loved it. They did mess up a few parts of our orders though which is why they only received 4 stars. Dressing was mixed up for two of us and one person did not have their ham on their chef's salad but still delicious! They have a $5 mimosa and $6 bloody mary special on Sundays. Those really aren't ""special"" prices in my opinion. I would drop them both down a dollar to be comparable with other Raleigh restaurants on Sundays but I will DEF be back! (which I've never said before about Mellow Mushroom). :)"
2015-08-24,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Jimmy V’s Osteria & Bar,"Our high hopes were ill fulfilled at best. In addition to slow service, there was a bunch of bread near our table by our feet and the staff stood there talking instead of cleaning it up, and one even hit on a girl in our party in a creepy way. I was impressed with the number of wines they offered by the glass, but my steak salad was a small serving at $18 and none of the members at my table thought anything was mind blowing. I suppose you are paying for location with Jimmy Vs. Nothing super offensive, but i would not return again given the abundance of banging Raleigh restaurants my dollar could support instead."

2015-08-24,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",P.G. Werth’s,"I found a new brunch place yay!! Being that brunch is one of my favorite meals I'm always looking for a new spot to check out. I've been hearing some great things about P.G. Werth's and man it was so good. Chef Hamm really knows what he's doing in that kitchen and his passion for food shows.I love the southern take on the menu. I went all out on my visit with the Southern Benedict a  Sweet potato biscuit, poached egg, fried green tomatoes, sausage, white pepper gravy.  I'm picky about my sausage gravy and this was some special gravy. If you want a taste of the south then all those ingredients I just mentioned above is the way to do it, and this is all in one dish:) They also serve up bottomless mimosas for $10 which is awesome.Chef also brought out some tasty hash bites to try mmm mmm good I loved my meal. The atmosphere is light and bright and they also have an outdoor patio. Perfect for a large party or small there was plenty of seating. Not sure about the dinner yet but I plan on returning soon to check it out. They also have a little market with food to go as well which would be a great stop during the work week. The waiters use iPads to place orders and for you to pay, I have to admit this was a little odd since they stand over you as you pay, also it recommends your tip so you don't feel like you have a chance to really leave what you want. I probably would have left a bigger tip if I wasn't using the iPads suggested % buttons. I like the iPad idea in coffee shops but not really in restaurants for waiters to use. This is one of the few restaurants that offers Saturday brunch in DTR. As I mentioned I love brunch so I'll take it on Sat. & Sun. if I can. Overall a great first visit and I can't wait to get back and try some more delicious food."
2015-08-24,4.0,"Austin, TX",Gringo A Go-Go,"This may be the only hyped-up Raleigh restaurant that is completely overrated. Gringo A Go-Go was a definite No-Go. I lived in Texas for more than 10 years and have been to Mexico several times. I have never been to a Mexican restaurant that charges for salsa and condiments (condiments were a small plate of a small amount of grilled onions, pickled vegetables, and mostly jalapenos) and only provides cilantro and onions in its tacos (other than the meat or vegan meat you order) as fillings. I can understand places that make their own chips charging for chips, but to charge for salsa on a taco?? There are no rice and beans or avocado as sides, and the tacos are very small, as you can imagine, as they have no fillings! Also, they do not make the tortillas on site (they are homemade, just not by them, which is pretty misleading). Additionally, although there were few customers when we went for lunch last week, service was pretty bad--had to ask numerous times for more water. Maybe the burrito is the way to go here, as it seems to include more food and you don't get nickle and dimed. Very disappointing experience."
2015-08-24,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",PDQ,"Oh man, how this place has fallen. And no, it's not really the service as they are still friendly and doing their job well, but it appears that corporate PDQ has decided to make some bad decisions and hand down cheapened recipes for the franchisees. 1) The bread has become this cheap, thin, and shiny pretzel-like mess of a bun that has no volume or flavor. 2) The sauces have been changed and seem to lack the kick they once had.3) The chicken sandwiches once consisted of tender-like composition, are now big masses of cheap, salty clumps of bird.

2015-08-24,4.0,"Wilmington, NC",Centro,The food selection here is authentic and delicious. They source their ingredients locally and fry their okra particularly well! The waitstaff makes this place 6 star worthy. Very attentive and knew exactly what to suggest or steer you away from menu and drink wise according to taste. Looking forward to making this a regular eat spot.
2015-08-24,2.0,"Cary, NC",18 Seaboard,"Went for Raleigh Restaraunt week and we were a bit disapointed. The fried okra appitizer had very little sauce and lacked flavor, the salad was ok but a bit strong on the acid. The main courses were lack luster. The mahi was well cooked but under seasioned and the rice was over cooked mushy and did not have much flavor. The brisket was good however the portions were small and the bbq sauce was bland. the deserts were the best part of the meal all were excellent. The wait staff brought an amuse bouche to other tables but not ours and the bread they brough was 4 tiny pieces which they did refill."

2015-08-24,5.0,"Boulder, CO",The Remedy Diner,"Good service with overpriced, tasteless, unimaginative food. Bear in mind I ate here when I was famished, having not eaten for over 6 hours. With so many restaurants in Raleigh, I highly recommend you go else where when dining.Good1. The service.Bad1. The BLT vegan sandwich was two slices of dry bread with two slices of tomato, a bit of avocado, a few pieces of lettuce and a few slices of what appeared to be store bought vegan bacon; I chose to skip on the ranch. As you can imagine the sandwich tasted rather dried out since there was so little filling. The seasoned potatoes were literally plain potatoes with absolutely NO seasoning, not even salt.2. My wife had the huevos rancheros, which looked equally unappetizing. The tortillas tasted really old, it was difficult to even cut through them they were so tough.3. Holding onto hope that they're desserts would save us, I had the vegan chocolate cake, which, judging from the yelp reviews and pictures, looked delicious. However, it was just as disappointing as the rest of the meal. When I think of vegan chocolate cake I think of a moist cake with deep, complex chocolate flavor. Unfortunately, what I got lacked almost any and all flavor. The icing was OK, but mostly tasted of sugar, not a lot of chocolate flavor. The best part of the cake was the soy whip cream.4. The peanut butter dessert was OK, but nothing I'd order again.5. For a price of 50$ we left hungry and frustrated, feeling conned."

The pharmacy has been very helpful (ordered the shampoo i wanted, called me 2 days later to say it was in; I let them know we go through bottles of that stuff so if they want to stock it, we'll buy it. Plus the price was better than other places.) They had lactaid tablets that I needed. Eye drops for allergies. And my daughter and I shared lunch last week that was very good- the chicken salad, which I had on top of the kale salad. Everything tasted really fresh and there were lots of other things on the menu we wanted to try. I have yet to switch my Rx's over to their pharmacy but I'll likely be doing that soon. I personally don't need them to have every little thing I need- there are other stores for that. I want neighborhood stores! And here we have one and I think it's done well, so consider getting to know it!"

Street parking is the only way for you to grab a bite here so I guess it could be very ugly when it's during dinner timeFood: I am here mainly for dessert. So I should have pecan pie but I ended up with apple pie due to its popularity ( but I ain't a fan of apple pie) I have to say even though I kinda hate apple pie, their Apple pie is way too delicious. The layers is clear and mixed well with other ingredients. In addition, the top crust is crispy and delicious! Service: bit slow. The owner is trying to talk with every customer and be nice. And everyone is not in a hurry but enjoy the hospitality. Very interesting. Their decorations suggest the restaurant has been here for a while and the owner is pilot?! I don't know but looks like a place with millions of history to be discovered. Pricy slices of cake - FYIOverall: love their cakes and I will come back for lunch sometimes."

It was about 5:45... and we were promptly seated upstairs (first time up there).We had chips/salsa and guac for starters. She order a white wine and I had mezcal and a Negra Modelo. The mezcal was killer... love that smokiness. It was so good I ordered another round.She ordered the chicken salad w/corn, and I got the enchilada family (which I've had before). Her chicken was a bit dry, but my enchilada plate was the bomb. Next was dessert, which was great, but I can't remember the name of it.Service was good, but the only thing that bugged was the manager. He kept cleaning right around us. Spelling cleaning solution while eating blows.Nonetheless, all in all, Centro rocks, it's better than Dos Taquitos, and Gonza.Btw, this comes from a dude who lived in San Diego over 35yrs.

Don't make the same mistake as me and think you can eat TWO arepas PLUS the chips and guac. because you can't. The arepas look deceivingly small but they pack so much meat in there it's no joke. I usually get one beef arepa and chips. YUM.Be wary though, the meats are VERY juicy, and so as you're eating, it's almost guaranteed the arepa will drip, so make sure to have lots of napkins. It's messy but it's gooooood!TIP: get the cilantro sauce. LISTEN TO ME AND GET THE CILANTRO SAUCE."

My boyfriend loves Mexican food and it hard to find a place he likes in Raleigh (there are tons in California).Overall, the wait staff was very friendly and attentive. Service was really fast and food came quickly after we order. Sadly, the dishes were underwhelming. I got the Burrito San Jose and felt like it was overseasoned. My boyfriend got Enchilada Verde, and the green sauce tasted like it was from a jar and not fresh made. My mom got a Chicken salad, and it was grilled chicken on a bed of lettuce with bell peppers and cucumber.I definitely would like to try their food again in a few weeks; hopefully they have worked out some kinks on their menu.Grade: C+"
2015-08-26,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Square Rabbit,"Not a huge fan of The Square Rabbit. First off, the food is just sitting in the cases and it always looks like it has seen better days. My coworkers go and pick food up there a lot but I'm not sure why because every time they bring it back, they spend 10 minutes adding salt, pepper, warming it up more, mixing it with other things, etc to improve it. Why not just make it yourself if it's that bad?We order Birthday cakes here for coworkers and yesterday we went to pick up a $20 *tiny* cake we had ordered and asked if we could just grab it and check out since the line was 20 people long. ""Nope, get to the back of the line"". Okay we'll stand behind all these people ordering $4 lunches and waiting while their old food gets warmed up when we called and PREORDERED a cake. The cake is normally not half bad but yesterday my coworkers and I all had stomachaches after eating it."
2015-08-26,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sullivan’s Steakhouse,"I feel like Sullivan's is more of a bar than a steakhouse based on the vibe I got.Yes I loved their meat, but I think the crowd was there more for the drinks than anything else.I got there at 6:30 pm on a weekday and the bar was packed. It was a bit loud inside but I fully enjoyed my experience.I came with my coworkers for a meeting and we took over one of their private dining rooms.Service was pretty good for the large crowd we were. However, I will say servers weren't the friendliest and we had to go out of our way to get their attention.Food was phenomenal. I chose the iceberg wedge salad for my appetizer. The blue cheese dressing was amazing but I will say that the lettuce wasn't 100% fresh. Also, I don't think they washed the iceberg lettuce all too well cause the salad tasted a bit chemically.The complimentary bread was pretty good. It's a nice baguette type of bread but nothing out of the ordinary.The steak was so flavorful. I asked for my filet mignon to be cooked medium rare but it came out rare. However, the seasoning and crust was soooo flawless that I ended up eating it all without any complaints!The whipped mashed potatoes were pretty good as well.The desserts were my favorite. I ended up eating two... Yes two... One of my coworkers didn't like her chocolate cake and knowing my sweet tooth, I couldn't pass on two desserts hahaThe chocolate cake was ooey-gooey on the inside and the vanilla ice cream melting on top really did it for me.The cheesecake was great as well! It had an airy texture to it that I really enjoyed. It wasn't too heavy in my opinion.Overall, food is great but the bill here will get hefty, guaranteed. I can't get myself to give it 5 stars because for the same price, I'd be able to get angus barn, my #1 steakhouse.I'd have to say that Sullivan's is too loud for a romantic evening... But I think it'd be a perfect location to meet up and get loose with friends."

You should!  I love supporting locally owned businesses - and they are great!  The sweet woman on the phone asked me when I wanted my food, not telling me when it would be ready, but asking me when I wanted it!  Anyway, if you are looking for their location... It's on Capital Blvd (northbound just past the intersection with Spring Forest Rd).  Pass the Starbucks where they don't care about your name and overcharge you for some brewed java beans).  Turn into s/c where Sweet Tomatoes, Best Buy & Michaels are located and look left!Ordered take-out from MonaPita over the weekend and a friend brought it over.  Need I say delicious!??!!  Eat there and you'll say yes!We didn't order much...2 Lamb Gyros with the Tzadiki sauce.  I usually always order extra sauce with gyros, but so glad I forgot!  It was a generous portion of chunky, tender lamb hugged by a large, warm, homemade pita.  Also, we didn't order the most traditional of Mediterranean food... French Fries!!  But they were so flavorful, that yes, I'd order them again!!  The baklava was tasty...small, but packed with flavor that it was just right!Not feeling well this week, but I'm thinking another lamb gyro might take the place of some chicken soup tonight!  Glad they're nearby!   I wish I had met the owners especially after reading all of their fabulous reviews!  I would have them over and would want them to stay...all while I eat their delicious food...and tell me all about themselves!There is definitely a great story behind this great food!Bon Appetit in Mediterranean!"

We were tended to by no less than a half dozen different people.  At no point were they frazzled and despite all the tables being full, it never felt busy. The portions were very generous (we all took home a to-go box).  We ordered hot and sour soup, shrimp lomein, sweet and sour chicken, and orange chicken. Nothing had a lot of heat (spice/peppery), but it all was tasty."
2015-08-26,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sawasdee Thai Restaurant & Bar,"Such a disappointment.   We've eaten here several times before, and found the good satisfactory to good.  The service was always friendly.  But today at lunch, our group of four were all unhappy.  The restaurant looked unkempt.  It took nearly ten mibutes to get acknowledged by the servers (only two, who needed a third to handle the phone and deliver take out orders ), then another ten minutes to take our orders.  Then ask twice for utensils and napkins.When the food finally arrived, one order was completely wrong.  We accepted it anyway, being unwilling to wait any longer.  They should have comped that dish, but we barely received an apology.Two orders of lackluster shrimp fried rice with lots of tomatoes and just a few shrimp.  One order of chicken pad thai had a particularly god sauce, but was destroyed by the weird, short, mushy noodles.  They closely resembled over cooked pasta, not the proper thai rice stick noodles.  My order of green curry with chicken was so-so.  The sauce was pleasantly hot as requested, had a good flavor, but the chicken was tough and had a slightly off taste.  It was also a rather small serving. The menu has changed dramatically.   It now includes sushi, sashimi, a few standard Japanese dishes and several ramen soup varieties.   I considered getting sushi, but something just told me NO, and I'm fairly certain that was wise.DH is a patient guy, but even he declared the service the worst he's experienced in recent memory.  The other couple who received the mistaken food order with barely an apology chose not to leave a tip.   I don't see return visits from any of us in the future."
2015-08-26,4.0,"Miami, FL",Neomonde Bakery & Deli,"This place is legit! I had a culinary event for a food club catered by Neomonde and they did not disappoint. Every single thing I ordered, including the sauces and pickled veggies, tasted authentic and was very tasty. The Middle Eastern members praised the Lebanese food for its authenticity and the non-Middle Eastern members couldn't get over how good the food tasted! I was blown away by how great the food was and I am definitely coming back here again.Hummus: A perfect blend of chickpeas, olive oil, garlic, tahini, and lemon. Each ingredient balanced one another. A good combination of sour and chickpeas tasting.Baba Ghanouj: Light and creamy eggplant spread. The smoky taste is a nice surprise when you dive into your first bite. If you are a fan of eggplant then you need to try some of this!Tabouli: A tart Middle Eastern salad that is more on the sour taste spectrum, but surprisingly refreshing with the mint and parsley added in. There is also some cracked wheat mixed in to add another taste of grain to the dish.Falafel: Fried chickpeas ball served with tahini sauce. It was a grainy taste with hints of lemon and garlic with each bite.Kibbeh: Finely ground beef in fried crack wheat with onions and typical Middle Eastern spices. They are usually in a football shape (American football). Initially you get a grainy taste, but as you reach the beef you get a blast of meat, onions, garlic and definitely some cumin.Lamb and Beef Shawarma: Heaven in my mouth! The alternating taste of lamb and beef with subtle hints of onions, tomatoes, and the amazing combo of Middle Eastern spices such as cumin, cinnamon, and oregano makes my mouth water while writing this....Baklava: buttery, sweet fillo dessert with an assortment of different nuts. A great combination of butter, honey, and nuts.Lady Fingers: Basically a baklava with fewer nuts and the fillo is rolled into a cylinder shape.Bird Nests: A very sweet dessert! Shredded fillo dough is on the outside while pistachios and walnuts fill the center. A sweet syrup tops it off, which gives it its sweet taste despite the fillo and nuts sort of balancing it out.Expand your global palate at Neomonde if you want to have the best Middle Eastern food Raleigh has to offer!"

All very well priced and it seemed, cooked to order. I ordered the Chow Fun (drunken noodle) and it had a wonderfully smoky aroma and flavor and possibly the thickest noodles I've ever had. It was a steaming bowl of smoky comfort food. The portion size was perfect and there was good amount of shrimp, cooked perfectly.  The sauce was a bit bland for me, I definitely wanted to kick it up- but that's personal preference.  My only complaint is that there was no condiments, like soy sauce, S&P, Sriracha, etc. on the tables. I requested hot mustard and got take-out packets, not what I was hoping for. Also, no chopsticks unless requested.I'll definitely go back!"

Plenty of seating both inside and out, and the atmosphere is clean and inviting. Their lunch meats are all Boars Head, definitely a plus. The sandwiches are huge and very delicious, and my sister and I know from sandwiches as we both worked for many years in a very busy Long Island deli. I did the ""build your own"" sandwich, turkey, swiss, lettuce, tomato, avocado, and bacon in a sun dried tomato wrap. My sister had the Gourmet Turkey Club, which is a double decker sandwich. Both were served with a pickle spear and their house made potato chips. If I were going to advise my dear readers though, I would pass on the double decker sandwiches and do the build your own, the double deckers seem to be more bread than meat. Still delicious, but us two old ladies are watching our carbs. Prices are a bit steep, Not too awful bad but I paid over $11.00 for a sandwich, chips and pickle spear, and a drink. I think it would have made more of a ""wow"" impression if I could have substituted the chips for maybe a little scoop of one of their salads.Would I go back? Sure! It's a nice place. I'd like to try one of their pizzas someday, and some of their hot dishes sounded pretty good too."

They gave us 3 pieces with whatever we ordered even without getting the appetizer portion. We have also gotten some great baked ziti - because if a working mom with kids who are in activities wants to feed the children, it's so much better to just order this! The kids alfredo portion is very generous. If you just want a serving spoon size each, 6 people could take some. They give a side salad with entrees.

2015-08-27,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Thai House,"After my first few visits here I was delighted to write a positive review on yelp. I will say that after a few more visits, my opinion of the food has not changed: the food is very good. I tend to order the same things every time I come but it is always consistently good. However the service has gotten worse and worse. I tend to come during lunch, so people during other hours may have different opinions. Their lunch is always packed, but the servers are always overwhelmed. I always tend to get the same server, A woman who is so overwhelmed during the lunch hour that it stresses me out. I don't receive drink refills, I don't get asked how my meal was, and there's barely enough time for her to drop off the check. Most times I tried to pay the check upfront so I don't have to wait the extra 5 to 10 minutes for her to return with the paid receipt.  However after today's experience, this will be my last visit in a a while. The waitress took five minutes to come and take my order. Then when my food finally came it was all cold. My appetizer came out at the same time as my entrée, and both were cold. I ate the entrée because I was very hungry, but I couldn't ask for a new appetizer because I never was able to get her attention again. No refill either. I will give her credit, when I asked her to take it off my bill she didn't argue with me. But overall it's just such a negative experience. Maybe it's because years ago I was a server so when I see a server overstressed it bothers me more than it should. But this restaurant needs to help their servers: either hire more people or do things to help them during the busy lunch shift because this isn't working"

2015-08-27,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",La Carreta Mexican Restaurant,"I was walking the dog a few weeks ago and walked by La Carreta for what must have been the 50th time since they put the signage up announcing their arrival all the way back in May.  It was late and I saw a parked van stopped in front of the yet to be opened location with the driver scoping out the interior of the restaurant.  I said hi to the driver, we struck up a conversation and came to find out it was the owner's wife.  She was so excited and proud of the new restaurant.  You could just sense that this is a venture they care deeply about.  The only thing I care about on a similar level is the imminent break-up of 1 Direction, but nobody can drag me down.So I brought the wife for dinner last night and she is just talking my ear off, arguing that Boy Meets World was a gritty show because Sean grew up with an alcoholic dad or something like that, just no.  Maybe in comparison to Step by Step or Full House.  The conversation eventually moved onto how she can't wait to watch Love Actually again for the 7 millionth time.  The reason this exposition is important?  The conversation was lacking, so I focused on the task at hand.  Hello chicken and nachos, meet my face.Immediately upon sitting outside, we were asked if we wanted cheese dip or guacamole or both. Yin to yang, I was in a cheese dip mood and she wanted guacamole.  They make the guacamole fresh right in front of you.  Cutting open the avocado, dicing up the tomatoes and mix-mix-mix.  I really loved this display of showmanship and the guac was top-notch, it was like Benihana but Mexican style.  Now if only they can figure out that trick where the chef crafts a guacamole volcano with steam blowing out of it...Chips came out immediately upon us taking our table and were refilled as myself and the boss (wife) were chomping on them.  Same goes for our drinks, which were refilled whenever our glasses were less than half-full.  Attentive and great service goes a long way towards winning my business.  Food was also above-average, they didn't use canned products.  Everything was fresh and my chicken with mole sauce comes recommended although I can't wait to try out more offerings on the menu.For this being day 3 of the restaurant, I honestly was a little disappointed in the turnout.  As a resident of Oberlin Court (leaving soon thankfully) I want to see this place hopping, especially after waiting over a year for a bar/restaurant to replace the OC.  Also, anytime I've headed home to Oberlin the traffic patterns at the restaurant look eerily reminiscent of the OC and we know how that turned out.It's a winning product, but I also have to pin what appears to be some of the initial lukewarm business on La Carreta themselves... outdoor seating, great location by Oberlin filled with hundreds if not thousands of young professionals and college kids that love Mexican food, Dave Matthews and margaritas, but meanwhile it took them over 3 months from putting up a sign they were moving in until officially opening up shop.  The 3 best months of summer are gone, to me it is like opening up an icecream/yogurt shop in December.  It's disappointing it took so long.  Coming from NYC where rents are so high, a crew can come in over the weekend and turn a bar into a Mexican restaurant.     The passion that the owners put into La Carreta shines though, from the décor and layout inside the restaurant to the individually prepared guacamole to the service.  I believe in the team and their dedication to making La Carreta a hit in Raleigh, that kind of attention to detail will win customers over time. Definitely give La Carreta a shot!  With the exception of the mozzarella sticks at the OC (best I ever had), this is an upgrade in every way from the previous tenant."

And even though they're dealing with mainly inebriated people, somehow the dudes at the counter are always in a good mood. They actually seem to be having fun, especially Clay (the mohawk guy).I wish we had something like DeMo's near Fayetteville Street because zpizza closes early and the late night hot dogs aren't cutting it.

Neat, right?Our server was excellent. He was prompt at taking our orders, refilling our drinks, and giving his opinion about the array of sake selections to pair with our meal. We wound up ordering tempura, a volcano roll, and a few sushi pieces to share à la carte.  The tempura tasted light and delicious; our volcano roll was an experience of flavor.  More importantly, our pieces of nigiri and maki were fresh and appealing.  I would try their scallop and uni nigiri again upon my next visit if they had it! The scallop had a pleasant buttery flavor with a tender texture, and the uni was like an ocean in my mouth without the offensive aftertaste. I even tried their nattō maki and to my delight they made a canonically ""gross"" food taste delicate.  Having since been to other sushi restaurants in the area, I would rank Waraji as one of the best.  Overall, I think there is a bigger selection of traditional sushi and sashimi pieces here as opposed to other restaurants in the area who tend to offer a limited selection of fish with more westernized rolls.  Yet the appeal of Waraji is that they offer modern rolls too, thus there's something for everyone here!Our bill was rather pricey, but after factoring in the variety of the menu, quality of the food, excellent service, and the atmosphere it is money well spent! I cannot wait to return again and sample other things on their menu."
2015-08-27,3.0,"Miami, FL",Busy Bee Cafe,"My wife and I used to come here quite a bit.  The place is a bit over priced but the limited beer selection is pretty good and so is the food and the atmosphere.I walk in on Tuesday evening (August 25, 2015) right around midnight (flight got in at 11pm). I used to live in Raleigh but now I visit about 4 or 5 times per year on business and I like to check out some of the old hang out spots.Made a bad joke, apparently, with the bartender by saying sarcastically if he had any room for one more at the bar (there were only 2 girls at the entire bar).  He gave me a menu, not saying anything, and walked away.  I asked him if he had anything dark on tap.  He walks back and points to the part of the menu that has all the beer.It was late; I was tired; I just wanted a burger and a beer.  So, I asked the guy if he could help point me in the right direction (you know, the bartender in a good beer bar can usually recommend something good).  This shocked me because I was one of 7 people in the entire place so it's not like he was busy, at all; the guy says: ""can you not read?""I looked at him, pushed the menu away and walked out...."
2015-08-27,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Waraji Japanese Restaurant,"Fresh delicious tasting sushi with excellent flavor and decor. I hadn't been here in many years as so many sushi restaurants have popped up everywhere, but here you can really taste the great quality of the fish and other ingredients."
2015-08-28,3.5,"Raleigh, NC",Babylon Restaurant,"A group of 6 or 7 of us met for dinner at Babylon on a Tuesday night. We may have been the only people there, and I'm not sure why. The bartender was friendly and helpful, as was the server. The atmosphere is great. I am a fan of the ultra-high ceilings and Moroccan decor.I had the Mediterranian Platter, which includes oven roasted eggplant, spicy tomato sauce, Moroccan marinated olives, roasted peppers, and tomato confit. This was all delicious, although as I type, I realize I only received four of those items. I believe the spicy tomato sauce was omitted. It was served with a plate full of fresh bread which was also delicious. The eggplant was a little on the spicy side for me, but not so hot I couldn't eat it. I had the crab cakes which were the size of small meatballs, breaded and fried. Incredibly tasty. My friends had the Chicken Bastillia Rolls which they raved about, but beware of the uber-spicy sauce served with it and know that you can request milder sauces. I felt the portions were a bit on the skimpy side for the price.Overall, I was happy with the food, the service, and the atmosphere. Not sure why we were the only ones there. You're missing out, Raleigh!"
2015-08-28,2.0,"Miami, FL",Sullivan’s Steakhouse,"I was reading previous reviews and it made me question if I was at the same place. Went there with a group of friends on Thursday. We sat in the bar and not one of us had a good experience. The martini's didn't fill the glass even half full, the service was beyond slow and not with a smile, the live music was too loud to have a conversation.I did enjoy watching desperate men trying to pick-up dolled up cougars. That is why I can proudly give one star!"
2015-08-28,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Borough,"I've eaten/had drinks at The Borough probably more than 200 times. I love this place. The owner Liz is a true gem. One time about two years ago my partner and I brought our puppy Gracie with us for some outdoor seating action - and ever since then, Liz always pauses to ask us how Gracie is doing or ask us why Gracie isn't with us. All of her customers and she remembers this little detail about us - THAT creates a return customer right there. We will always come here to grab drinks or a quick delicious dinner when the opportunity arises.This is the kind of place I feel like I would frequent if I lived in NYC. It's loud and crazy on the weekends, chock full of humans who wanna have a good time. On weeknights, it's quiet and perfect for a little date night or get together with friends. The drinks are STRONG, just the way I like them! Tip: try the How Do You Q at least once in your lifetime. Just once. Whoa, baby. They've got some awesome vegetarian options and the broccoli and french fries are both delicious side choices. Get their spicy ranch - that stuff is ON POINT (I'm a bit of a sauce snob). I've never had a piece of food I didn't like here and I've had a LOT of their food - the black bean salsa is AMAZING. My favorite sandwiches are the Shillalagh, the BLT&A and the pearodactyl. Most of the servers have been there for years and know us and welcome us as family as we walk in the door. I love going to a place with low turnover because you truly feel like you're a part of it as much as it's a part of you. Keep doing your thing, Borough!Extra KUDOS: Acceptance of any and everyone who walks through that door!"
2015-08-28,5.0,"Cary, NC",Jimmy V’s Osteria & Bar,"Had been wanting to try this place out.  We don't get downtown very often cause we live WAY OUT in Cary.......LOL!!    Anyway, we arrived around noonish on a Friday.  It wasn't empty but also  not a wait.   We sat out on the patio area.  It was a bit on the warm side for me, by Hubby was good so I endured.  Service was quick and efficient.  Our waiter made suggestions.  I had a lot of questions.  We were quickly served water and bread with a plate of olive oil and a basamic schmear.We both ordered the ""working lunch"" special.  $10.  You get a cup of soup, a salad and a sandwich on focaccia bread.   ALL the ingredients were super fresh !!!   Each item was delicious.  I would definitely go back.  The table next to us got pizza and it looked delicious.  Next time --  PIZZA !!!!   Try them out...........lots of draft beer on tap."
2015-08-28,5.0,"Winterville, NC",Kadhai The Indian Wok,"Horrible service. A couple Indian girls who serve have very poor people's skills, don't seem to understand the order.... Huge language barrier!! The food is even worse! Wouldn't go back even if paid to eat there."
2015-08-28,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Babylon Restaurant,Bomb.dizzle.  They play house music. Very chill ambiance. From CA and I have been searching for a LA style hang out. Effing love it! And the lamb was amazing!
2015-08-28,5.0,"Clayton, NC",Sosta Café,"The service was excellent and faster than I expected. The food was amazing and all the veggies used were crisp and fresh. We definitely ate more than we usually do. However, although we were completely stuffed we did not feel heavy. Usually we hate ourselves for overeating but this time we felt quite satisfied. Also, It's customary for me to pop some chewing gum in my mouth after I eat, but not this time. The sides that came with the sandwiches left such a good taste in my mouth that I did not want to get rid of it anytime soon. If I'm ever in downtown Raleigh craving a delicious sandwich, this is the place I'll go."
2015-08-28,1.0,"Columbia, SC",Bahama Breeze,The worst service ever our server Brant sucked!! Food was basic and nothing worked in the bathroom I think our server was high or drunk
2015-08-28,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",MachuPicchu Peruvian Cuisine,"Delicious!  My wife & I decided to have lunch there on a Friday, and it was excellent.  The entire staff is very nice and a chef came to our table to ask how we liked it.  The Chicha Morada (purple corn drink) is unusual & very tasty, with a lot of cinnamon and other spices.  Seco de Res (beef) is a bit salty, but it is supposed to be.  The salt is balanced well with the other flavors & spices.  Pollo Saltado tastes as good as it looks on the plate.  Roasted tomatoes & onions with herbs accompany this dish and really present the dish well.  We will be back."
2015-08-28,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",La Carreta Mexican Restaurant,"I walked out yesterday wanting to give this place a 5.  I was so happy to see it was finally open and we had such wonderful service, great food, and the homemade Guacamole like Larry G mentions was out of this world. (Yes I'm the Boy Meets World fan he mentions so admirably in his review).Today, I'm super disappointed.  The hubs is out of town and I wanted to keep it local to maximize my chick flick (see also: love actually) time. I tried calling at 8pm-  ballsy to call at a prime dinner hour, sure, but if my meal took longer to make, so be it.  It was worth the wait, the food was just that good.  The phone rang about 20 times with no answer and like a nervous school girl waiting for her uninterested crush to pick up the phone, I hung up and decided to try again in 20 mins (was I allowing myself to be vulnerable, sure but again, the food was just that good) I went to Harris Teeter and seriously considered just making myself something from the salad bar. At 8:44 I called again, this time someone picked up but put me 'on hold' for a good 3 mins (which may not seem awful, but I could hear all the noise and commotion going on in the background.  Finally, the man on the phone came back and due to the noisiness I had to repeat my order 3 times.  (I just wanted a burrito, it's not like I was placing an order for a family of 5). So I hear 'it will be ready in 15 mins' and loop back around to pick up my order). I go in and there is one girl waiting for takeout also... She looks about as happy as a person who just found out the Mindy Project got canceled from fox (note: that's not a happy thing at all). I learned all she wanted was beans and chips and queso and had to remind the girl at the front desk that she was also still waiting for takeout.  When I told the hostess and the young man at the front desk I ordered takeout I was met with a look of confusion.  The young man rushes to the back presumably to check with someone about where and how takeout orders work. A third man walks in- tells the front desk he ordered takeout and is met with the same blank confused stare.  He had ordered takeout for his whole family and everyone was completely unsure what he ordered and what I ordered. Fast forward through all the back and forth- queso girl gets her meal and bounces, looking seemingly unimpressed (as she should) while Family Guy and I need to re give our orders because 'the guy in the back got confused and messed things up' Eek. Family Guy and my food come out at the same time- I didn't get my side salad, but I did get chips and it's now 9:30 and I'm too tired and Hangry to fight for my greens (I knew I should have gotten one from Teeter!).  The credit card machine was acting up and both of us had trouble getting our cards read.  We both hustled out of there ASAP.  It's early, and I want this place to succeed, I really do.  My advice would be to dine in until they get their act together.  Why the three stars and not less after this crazy fiasco? The food really is just that good."
2015-08-28,3.0,"Wyncote, PA",The Remedy Diner,"A must visit every time I'm in Raleigh. I love the decor, the staff and the delicious food. It's tasty and healthy, if you choose to go that route. The goat cheese salad is sublime. The tempeh Reuben is perfectly balanced and fantastic. Today I had the groovy train pita sandwich and it too was great. The fried broccoli perfectly balanced by the goat cheese and avocado. I love the coffee and their beer selection is great if you rang to go that route. The staff is attentive without being pushy and helpful when your not sure what to choose. Inside seating is cool and comfy but this visit I sat outside in the courtyard and enjoyed the bird song and potted garden. This is a great place to bring a combo of vegans, vegetarians and meat eaters. Everyone can find something to enjoy here."
2015-08-28,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",La Carreta Mexican Restaurant,"I have been eagerly awaiting for this place to open (I live in Oberlin court). I moved here from Southern California a few years ago so needless to say my Mexican food fix has never quite been satisfied in NC (although chubbies and nanataco have helped me survive). However,  there are not any local Mexican restaurants with waitstaff that get it right (all the good ones are walk up ordering). I think this place comes pretty darn close to getting it right. I came in for lunch solo and was immediately greeted and offered a booth. The place was decently packed (off to a better start than OC bar and grill which was a ghost town during the day). The waitress was quickly behind bringing water and chips and salsa. The chips were a bit over done but the salsa was mild and addicting. The menu is extensive and took awhile to read through. They have a number of reasonably priced lunch specials on the back. I went with the steak taco salad. I was really impressed with how great of quality the steak was! Very well seasoned and chopped flank steak with no fatty pieces. Tasty beans, rice, lettuce, sour cream, guac and pico de gallo filled the rest of the flour taco shell. While the dish looked standard, the taste was reminiscent of so cal, a high delicious bar. Kudos on the decor and waitstaff as well. I hope this place makes it! Oh and there is a full bar! While I did not partake, there seemed to be a number of decently priced drinks and shooters!"
2015-08-28,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Shuckers Oyster Bar & Grill,The food here has always been good. I can't complain about that. However the menus are slimy and sticky and sometimes with visible gunk on them. I want to believe menu cleanliness isn't related to kitchen cleanliness but it's not a great first impression.
2015-08-28,5.0,"Durham, NC",Kai Sushi and Sake Bar,"Service, food, ambiance are all awesome! Yummy sushi and healthy options for lunch. Love the forbidden rice dishes they are a must try! Tuna Poke is the best I have ever had super delicious!"
2015-08-29,5.0,"Lexington, SC",Cariokos Rotisserie Chicken,"Very good rotisserie chicken!  It has a smoky/spicy flavor with a hint of cinnamon. But it wasn't overwhelming - just right.  And the staff was super friendly and helpful. We got a combo and tried 3 of their sides. The plantains, vegetable rice (they give you 2 yummy sauces that go great with this), and black beans with fresh cilantro. The portions were a good size. We really enjoyed this place for lunch. Good value for the price too. My combo was 5.99 and my husband's was 6.49. We also tried their fresh pineapple juice beverage - pretty good too. I'd like to try the coconut one next time."
2015-08-29,3.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Person Street Pharmacy,"Absolutely fantastic lunch at Person street. I had the kale salad, which was perfect. The true star of the show, however, was the pulled pork sandwich, which is really just one of the most delicious sandwiches I have ever tasted. The setting is very casual and the service was warm and friendly. Highly recommended for lunch on Person street!"
2015-08-29,5.0,"Wake Forest, NC",Hayes Barton Café & Dessertery,"Last night, I thought I would like dessert, but not just ordinary. My fiancée and I went searching and we found the spot, though to be honest I really don't want to share, the desserts were that good. We took three home. Toasted coconut with lemon cake, key lime, and caramel apple. My mouth is still watering while I write these words. The key lime had the light tart key lime taste with a wonderful graham crust. The dessert sang melodies in our mouths reminiscent of when mom or nana called you in for your first slice of goodness. Try this place, all will be right with the world."
2015-08-29,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",MoJoe’s Burger Joint,"Awesome burgers. You gotta come here and get you some burgers. Seriously, this is a great casual place with good food and great service"
2015-08-29,4.0,"Apex, NC",Pho Vietnam,"This place is a wonderful surprise hidden on Buck Jones Road. I have dined here many times for months and been remiss in not reviewing. Do not let the exterior fool you. This is a hidden gem in Cary. Great Pho, fantastic spring rolls. The service is outstanding, they make you feel like honored guests and you can see how much pride they put into what they serve. Incredibly fresh and authentic. This is a must try in Cary, whether you are a longtime lover of Vietnamese or trying for the first time."
2015-08-29,4.0,"New Castle, DE",Shuckers Oyster Bar & Grill,Great food and decent prices with outside seating! Loved it all! Highly recommend the mussels appetizer!
2015-08-29,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sassool,"This food is awesome! I love that as a vegetarian there are so many options and that for my vegan friends it's also great. I have had so many things here. I'm a huge tzatziki fan. Nothing like some fresh from a wood burning oven pita bread with some hummus and some tzatziki. I have had the veggie lasagna, Baba Ghanoush, hummus, tzatziki, the falafel and the veggie burger. Don't even get me started on the baklava. The chocolate mousse is divine. This particular tonight 8/29/15, it was slammed busy. The quality of food and service is never different. Everyone working there is so nice and helpful. I usually wait to review a place after going multiple times to increase the accuracy of my opinion. This place has been consistently fresh and delicious along with friendly service. Check it out!"
2015-08-29,4.0,"Charlotte, NC",Mitch’s Tavern,"Liz made a good Bloody Mary, food smells great! (Had eaten before arriving) People nearby were saying how great the Sangria was. Have Yuengling, Kolsch, Hop Hunter, Hoppyum, Bad Penny on tap"
2015-08-29,5.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Taqueria El Toro,"Delicious! Went into the restaurant for lunch after reading the great reviews. I was unsure of what to order at the counter since some of the items were unfamiliar, but I went with the grilled chicken burrito. It was delicious and all of the ingredients were very fresh. I liked the salsa and topping bar as well. The food was ready very fast after ordering. Next time I am in the Raleigh area I will definitely be back."
2015-08-29,5.0,"Austin, TX",Taqueria El Toro,"As fresh and authentic and affordable as it gets. Better than most Mexican restaurants in Texas and hands down the best place in Raleigh. Homemade tortillas and a huge free salsa and condiments bar were sweet redemption after being charged for these things at Gringo...The grocery next door has the best prices on Goya products I've seen in Raleigh, as well as tortillas and baked goods made on site."
2015-08-30,5.0,"Apex, NC",Char-Grill,I highly recommend the steak burgers. The food at Char Grill is cooked quickly yet the smells coming from the restaurant will still keep you so eager! Great spot for a quick juicy burger!
2015-08-30,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",ORO Restaurant & Lounge,"Really great food - and great service - Chilean sea bass our favorite, veal ravioli, not so much great mac and cheese, and although it was not hot enough the potato garlic soup was also good - bill adds up fast though when there is so much good food to try! Will definitely go back but make it for a special occasion - need to try the short ribs and the corn!"
2015-08-30,5.0,"Montreal, Canada",Vivace,Excellent food just excellent.  I've tried several things on the menu and have always been delighted.   The restaurant has great ambiance and is also very livery and fun.  A must see in the north hills area.
2015-08-30,5.0,"Morrisville, NC",The Players Retreat,Pros - nice outdoor dining option / pet friendlyCons - Hawaiian burger was not tasty at all. I asked server no jalapeños but it still ended up w/ my burger & had a (looks like) canned pineapple that was dry. Banzai(similar to Aloha burger) is better at Red Robin. My husband ordered chili w/ everything on it. They even charged extra 75 cents for jalapeños which is ridiculous.
2015-08-30,5.0,"Midtown East, Manhattan, NY",P.G. Werth’s,"Waited for at least 20 mins to order anything, service was inadequate, the cappuccino I ordered did not have foam on top, the food was below average. Overall not impressed."

It's going to take a while but I love keeping track of all different beers I've tried with the promise of a plate of honor on the wall at 200! So many drafts, bottles, seasonals, fire sales, NC draft deals, rare and limited beers, trivia nights, pint nights and so on. I highly recommend a giant warm soft pretzel when the munchies hit."

2015-08-30,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sullivan’s Steakhouse,"again, i wish there was a half star option on yelp, because i'd truly rate sullivan's a 4.5.  i've been here several times for dinner, but most recently went to the bar with several friends for apps and drinks.  we arrived around 9:00 on a saturday night.  it was pretty busy, but there was still several tables available in the bar area (first come, first serve).  it has a very nice ambiance, and they even had live music (a guy playing a guitar.  he was good and we enjoyed listening to him, but i also appreciate that the volume was at a level so that you could still have a conversation with those sitting around you and you didn't have to yell at each other).  the bar area is dimly lit and very cozy, which is a nice change from some of the crazier bars on glenwood.  the cocktails are great (i would recommend the signature knockout martini) and they have a decent beer selection.  for food, my husband got the tavern sliced steak from the bar menu, and i ordered the crabcake appetizer from the dinner menu.  both were delicious!  we wanted to order oysters as well, however we wanted them steamed vs. raw, but the kitchen couldn't accommodate this request which was a bummer.  our server was very nice, friendly and efficient (never let a drink go empty without asking if we would like a refill).  all dining experiences i've had a sullivan's have been excellent, but i really prefer to hang out at the bar for drinks and a light bite to eat."
2015-08-31,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Seaboard Cafe,"Seaboard Cafe is one of the nicest, unpretentious and pleasant dining experiences in Raleigh. I discovered the cafe in 2005 and have been going back ever since. Rick, the owner, is one of the most cheerful people I have ever met. He often greets customers at the door. The food is delicious. Soups are fantastic, the sandwiches are worth your time and most everything on the menu is worth a taste. My wife LOVES the pickled carrots and cannot wait to get them again. On a Spring afternoon there is no better place to eat lunch in town. Located inside Logan's Garden center, you will find yourself surrounded by flowers, butterflies and be just generally satisfied with life. The rest if the year? Well, you'll just have a great relaxing meal."
2015-08-31,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sawasdee Thai Restaurant,this place isn't much of a scene (which I like but I know some people look for hipness as a part of their experience) but the food is very good! I like it better than any other Thai options in the triangle. the staff is friendly and my good experiences there have always been consistent.
2015-08-31,5.0,"Apex, NC",Frank’s Pizza & Italian Restaurant,"Not against the place or what they're doing. The pizza is fine and the service is okay. Barely okay. When we took a table and asked a server to give us some hot sauce, her answer was ""I'll go get your server for you."" I'm THIS CLOSE to dropping it all down to 1 star just for that lackluster show of indifference/laziness.We had a couple slices at a table with crumbs all over it. Not a big fan of the sketchy strip location. It's un-cared for and shady-looking characters loiter in the area. Not the business' fault, but that sort of thing is impactful on a potential customer's decision to dine there.The restroom was just clean enough.No, not a fan."
2015-08-31,5.0,"Carrboro, NC",Tazza Kitchen Cameron Village,"""Know your farmers, love your food.""^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ already a good start!Tazza has a wonderful, unique wine selection. I like having more by the glass options that tastes great than having to choose a bottle from pages of wines.. (I recommend the Cococciola!)The food was simple and delicious. We had the shrimp & crispy polenta and the garganelli pasta & fennel sausage. I liked the fresh tomatoey-ness of the first dish, but not a huge fan of the texture of the polenta. The exterior was crispy but since most of the polenta has been soaking in the broth, it was mostly mushy. But I liked the earthy flavor of the polenta. THE PASTA WAS DELICIOUS. First off, the pasta was perfectly cooked. I mean, not overcooked and not too al dente; it was just perfect. Combined with the salty fennel sausage, it was a simple pasta dish that I will daydream about for days. The chocolate budino is luscious. Presented in a small glass jar, it looks like a homemade chocolate pudding/custard/mousse/fudge goodness. The topped almond and salt flakes really helped compliment the richness of the chocolate. It may be a bit overwhelming for those who aren't obsessed with chocolate though. I thought I was....but good thing my friend and I shared one!No big complaints about this lovely restaurant. Prices are just as expected for $$. Great vibes, friendly service, and yummy food & wine. I definitely plan on returning!"

Super cheap beers, REALLY good mojitos and tons of fun empanads you can mix and match.  Our waitress was really nice and got everything perfect (we were a table of 8).  The Piggy Wiggley was my favorite, but my haberno pork and chicken tinga were also great.  It was good and CHEAP and fun."
2015-09-01,5.0,"New Orleans, LA",The Borough,"Service was great and the fried green beans were delish, and I'm not really a green bean eater to begin with. Also had the matzo ball soup and that was very good too."
2015-09-01,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Lee’s Kitchen,The food is ok. I wouldn't say the best Jamaican food I've had but it's ok. The major problem is how long it takes to get your food. I waited an hour. In a small crowded for an over priced oxtail tray.
2015-09-01,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sawasdee Thai Restaurant,"I'm been coming to Sawasdee for years, and went over for lunch with my wife yesterday.  The first thing we noticed was a sign on the door that said ""No coupons accepted"".  Previously I've used Groupons, so I wasn't sure what that was about (maybe change in ownership?).We both ordered our meals, and noted that in both cases the food was overcooked.  Typically the server provides a spice tray, and when I asked for it, my server walked away and came back with a jar of red pepper, not the typical spice tray.The whole time the waitress served us she had a long face like she was having a bad day, so she didn't add anything special to the event.Sad to say, but considering how many good Thai restaurants there are in Raleigh, I'd be hard pressed to come back to Sawasdee after this experience."
2015-09-01,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Midtown Grille,"Had a great dinner here. The duck was delicious, the table bread was good, and the staff was helpful and friendly. My wife just had a burger, which she said was a very good burger, but with Cowfish and Yard House across the street, finding a good burger in North Hills is not difficult. The only thing we didn't care for was the cheese board, but that was just personal preference. Overall, I'm impressed."
2015-09-01,3.0,"Surrey, Canada",Brio Tuscan Grille,"Came here on a Wed evening, it was busy and it's a large place. We were seated easily, staff were friendly. Food is above average and I really enjoyed the pasta dish I ordered."
2015-09-01,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Margaux’s Restaurant,My favorite place in Raleigh. Perfect blend of European and American (and sometimes Asian) flavors. The menu is quite eclectic and is often a fusion of different food cultures which is really neat. Service is always great - there is very little turnover among the staff which is always a sign of good management.
2015-09-01,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Shuckers Oyster Bar & Grill,"I went to Shuckers for the first time recently. I love seafood and oyster bars so was excited to try this place. I unfortunately didn't get a chance to try the oysters, but did try some other seafood. The mahi stuffed with crabmeat was a little dry but very good. I think the crabcakes would be delicious based on the stuffing. I also tried the scallop entree, which were cooked perfectly and had a great marinade on them. The meal comes with hushpuppies for the table. Their hushpuppies were a little disappointing, but you can't complain about free! Overall, I liked Shuckers but gave them 3 stars because while it was good, it did not blow me away. I thought service was a little slow as well, especially given how empty it was. The prices for seafood were very reasonable, even the lobster tails. I would definitely come back and would like to try the oysters next time."
2015-09-01,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Garland,"What took me so long to get here? Really this has quickly become my new favorite place to eat downtown Raleigh. As I write this I am seriously salivating, thinking of all the deliciousness. We went in on a Tuesday night and sat at the bar. My sister and I split a bottle of reasonably priced dry rose. We had the cauliflower 65 to start, which was awesome. We then tried their heirloom tomato appetizer, a dish consisting of grilled queso asadero, marinated Japanese eggplant, pistachio, herbs, lemon. Simple, amazing ingredients and to die for. I loved this so much I have been attempting to recreate it at home.  We then moved on to the Lamb Curry.  I am still dreaming about that lamb curry.  It was absolutely perfect. Our server/bartender was super friendly and helpful with the menu.  I can't wait to get back here and try out some of the other menu items!"
2015-09-01,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Shuckers Oyster Bar & Grill,"I visited Shuckers on Glenwood South this week for a friend's birthday. I had heard good things about this place from friends who had dined at the Wake Forest location. When I walked inside, I was shocked at how big this place was -- a plus since we were with a big group. I ordered a small portion of the fresh scallops (small = 1 skewer of 4 scallops) and a loaded baked potato for my entree. It was all the perfect temperature and delicious, and the portions were just right for dinner. I especially loved the complementary hushpuppies while we waiting for our entrees. They do ""priority seating"" via OpenTable, which worked well for us during the week. Not sure if it is as beneficial on busy weekend nights. All in all, a positive experience!"
2015-09-01,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Waraji Japanese Restaurant,"like everyone else says, best sushi in the triangle. The fish is fresh, they always have fatty tuna, and appetizers and sake selection is really good too."
2015-09-01,5.0,"Santa Rosa, CA",Taqueria El Toro,Words can't describe how delicious this place was. Also the cost was pretty good. The place was packed when we got there but when we left it was even more packed. There was a line to get into the parking lot! I love Mexican food and this place goes into the top 3 places I have ever been in the U.S. I reside in Northern California so I know about Mexican food and this place is top notch
2015-09-01,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Waraji Japanese Restaurant,"They have some of the best sushi in the Triangle. Don't neglect their kitchen food! They have some traditional Japanese items on their menu that you'll not find anywhere else. Check out their lunch menu too, which is more affordable and has some nice dishes you won't find on the dinner menu."
2015-09-01,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",DeMo’s Pizzeria & Deli,This is a great little pizza joint!  I had a slice of pizza and a salad and the ranch dressing is to die for!! The staff is extremely friendly and you can't beat the location and price! I will definitely be back!!
2015-09-02,4.0,"Minneapolis, MN",Brookside Market & Deli,"I have only tried the Caprese' salad at the Brookside Market & Deli but let me tell you...it is the BEST Caprese' salad I have ever had. The ingredients are so fresh and nicely arranged it is surprising that you are eating this meal for under 8 dollars. The staff are friendly, efficient, and the kitchen looks very clean. Well done."
2015-09-02,5.0,"Cary, NC",Monapita Mediterranean Grill,Loved it! But lost marks for having cramped space and not having condiments out and available for customers to pick up.Delicious though!
2015-09-02,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tenko Japan,"Take out hibachi? It's as good as it sounds!! Seriously- quick and nearly as good as a sit down hibachi place but at a fraction of the price. The teriyaki chicken were o.k, slightly dry, but the shrimp were fantastic. The fried rice and sauteed veggie were A+ as well. I only wish they wouldn't give you the shrimp sauce automatically... I have no self restraint when it comes to that stuff. Nom nom nom."
2015-09-02,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",State of Beer,Great beer selection - possibly the best in the triangle. Very knowledgeable staff and awesome sandwiches.
2015-09-02,4.0,"Minneapolis, MN",Hayes Barton Café & Dessertery,The best damn desserts in Raleigh. Hands down. Their hours are a bit wonky so check to make sure they are open before making the trek to get your tasty treats. :)
2015-09-02,5.0,"Minneapolis, MN",Humble Pie,"My boyfriend and I came here for drinks and tapas on a weeknight a few weeks ago. We were seated outside which was covered with ample ceiling fans and loving white Christmas lights decorating the joint. It was such a nice atmosphere to have dinner. We had about 5 small plates that we shared and all were pretty good. I will say that I thought the gnocchi was a bit bland, however my boyfriend thought it was delicious. The roasted brussel sprouts were to die for. I liked this place a lot, but didn't love it. I would come back to try more of their menu offerings in the future."
2015-09-02,2.0,"Washington, DC",42nd Street Oyster Bar & Seafood Grill,"Simply delicious!! Buffalo oysters appetizer, Chilean sea bass!! and Aha tuna followed w/ a snickers martini!!! Atmosphere is very nice with oldies playing. The service was fast and pleasant. Great  experience!!"
2015-09-02,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mandolin,I've been wanting to visit this place and took my wife along with a few friends there last night for her birthday dinner. Got to say that the food was excellent. The open face BLT is with every piece of fresh tomato and bacon. The main course was oh so great. Everyone from the moment we entered the restaurant were friendly. I loved the feel and will be going back. Worth the visit for dinner. Parking is just bad.
2015-09-02,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Serena Sicilian Influenced Cucina,"Hadn't been in awhile but it still has fabulous food and portions.  Very relaxing atmosphere and service was friendly.  The bar has a very nice selection of beer and wine and the specials are always great.The Coal-fired oven has had issues.  I haven't had that pizza but I know that patrons are concerned and hope it is fixed.  We hope so too.  The small bites on the happy hour menu have changed and we hope that it isn't a sign that the restaurant might close.It is a wonderful family oriented neighborhood spot.  We love having it in North Raleigh.  Please keep the menu as is, and don't change it.  It's terrific.Meatballs are the best in town."
2015-09-02,5.0,"Old Bridge, NJ",Firebirds Wood Fired Grill,This was the first time to the Firebirds. The ambiance was excellent. The food was great- the ribs were so tender that they fell right off the bone. The crab cake appetizer was big enough for a meal and very tasty. In addition the server was excellent- she was very attentive and provided us with suggestions that we did not regret. Would definitely go back
2015-09-02,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Irregardless Cafe & Catering,As a vegetarian I am usually limited to a few options on the menu. I was spoiled for choice while going over the list of entrees. I had the Chile Relleno and I must say it was one of the most fulfilling meals I have had in recent times. I would like to add that the service was great and the live music was a really nice touch.
2015-09-02,3.0,"Durham, NC",La Carreta Mexican Restaurant,"So myself and 5 other coworkers gave this new place a try today! First things first, I love the decor-very different  than the previous tenants. The lunch menu was reasonably priced. We were seated in a large booth near the bar. Our server brought brought two baskets of chips and some salsa for the table. I was surprised that the salsa had a bit of a kick to it! I ordered the #3 on the lunch menu-a taco and an enchilada. I was a little confused bc I thought I'd get to pick what type of meat I'd like, and wasn't even asked. I learned when  the food arrived, both the taco and enchilada had ground need in them. The food was very good! Rice and beans came with the meal. I will most definitely be back and I'm looking forward to trying more on the menu! I think I will end up being a regular because it's super close to my job! I wish y'all success!"
2015-09-02,3.0,"Irvine, CA",Oak City Meatball Shoppe,"So so good.  I was counting on that fact since it was a meatball focused restaurant.  It has to be good to keep the doors open...  I had the beef meatballs with tomato sauce and a side of spaghetti.  Friendly service, great environment.  I will be back."
2015-09-03,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Hayes Barton Café & Dessertery,"I visited this location to try a slice of the cake, being that the reviews were so high. I tried the carrot cake and it was okay. I wish they would have added some ingredients to the icing which was pure cream cheese. It was a lot of icing being that the cake slices are huge. I would return and try a different flavor cake."
2015-09-03,2.0,"Matthews, NC",Serena Sicilian Influenced Cucina,"A friend of mine suggested this place. Second time I've been here. First time I had pizza ""excellent. Second time I had a salad. Fantastic. Try had these fried chick peas and peppers with spinach. Best salad I've had in a long time. Definitely a place to go."
2015-09-03,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Pho Vietnam,Some of the best Pho I have ever had! The broth was flavorful and had just the right amount of spice.
2015-09-03,5.0,"Durham, NC",Oak City Meatball Shoppe,"Don't really get the hype about this place.  My partner and I stopped by one night-- we're both meatball fans and had always had this place on our radar.  There is nothing *wrong* with the food they serve here.  The meatballs are just lacking a certain.... je ne sais quoi.I left feeling full (on bread mostly.  the meatball servings are actually pretty small)... but really dissatisfied.  It felt like a soulless meal, sadly.  :("
2015-09-03,5.0,"San Francisco Bay Area, CA",Taqueria El Toro,"Stopped by this taqueria on the way back home to CA. This is some of the best authentic Mexican  food I have ever had! I got the torta cubano, which was huge and very tasty. I also got a pastor taco. I was not the BEST pastor I've have but its up there with the top 3. The salsa bar they have has many different options of flavor you want. The grilled jalapenos were amazing as well. The restaurant was packed on a Sunday and parking lot was full. I would love to say that I will defiantly be back, but I highly doubt that I will be back in North Carolina any time in the near future!."
2015-09-03,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kimbap,The bibimbap was absolutely amazing!  The service was great and all of the kitchen/wait staff was friendly.
2015-09-03,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chow Pizza Bar,Excellent food and a big craft beer selection. You can't go wrong with the crispy jalapenos or any one of their pizzas. The Greek salad is delicious and so are the veggie quesadillas. The wait staff has always been attentive when I've been there. Do yourself a favor and stop in for delicious food and beer.
2015-09-04,2.0,"Los Angeles, CA",Vivace,I like the atmosphere indoors and out at Vivace. I also had a good salad and entree. One of the top 5 restaurants in the North Hills area which is pretty meaningful (that is just my opinion). Not too pricey. I think you get what you pay for in a good way.
2015-09-04,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Manhattan Cafe,"One of the best Philly cheesesteaks that I have ever personally ate....and I've spent months in Philadelphia working!! Great service, great people. Was in and out in minutes. Not much more to say other than, go try it. You won't be disappointed."
2015-09-04,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Backyard Bistro,"This was arguably the worst $15 per person food I've had in a long time. I ordered the brisket with Mac and cheese and hush puppies. And half of the brisket was fat and was nowhere near the quality of the food at places like the pit or even Carolina BBQ. And the waitress recommended the hush puppies and they were average at best but the honey butter they use was nasty. And the Mac and cheese was terrible. I think this place was meant to be a sports bar that should only serve bar food and not a real restaurant, if your looking for good food don't eat here."
2015-09-04,5.0,"Cary, NC",Sosta Café,Tried it for the first time about a month ago and I've been back once a week ever since.  SO delicious and excellent customer service.  You can feel and taste the authenticity!  I recommend the alpine with the cous cous and chickpea sides- that's the first thing I ever got and I love it so much  I haven't been able to stray to other parts of the menu!!!!
2015-09-04,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Cristo’s NY Style Pizza,"I love this place. When we first moved to Raleigh from Charlotte, we spent a long time trying a variety of pizza joints.If you're into foldable slices, NY style, this is where it's at!"
2015-09-04,5.0,"Chicago, IL",Taste Small Plates | Wine Bar,"Ahi tuna, surf and turf (I liked the pork, by friend liked the scallops). Menu is short but the food is good, didn't try the wine."
2015-09-04,2.0,"Holly Springs, NC",Black Cat Cafe,"I prefer to eat vegetarian, and ""California healthy food"" is my favorite (just so you know what I like). I have, however,had a hard time finding vegan food that I actually enjoy eating ( even in California). I bought a vegan veggie burger with pineapple salsa and black beans (wasn't sure about the vegan part, but I love pineapple), and it was just plain delicious.Then I got some peanut butter pie; absolutely amazing. I will definitely be back for more  wonderful ""Black Cat Cafe"" food. ""Thank You Raleigh and Black Cat Cafe"" for finally enthusiastically joining  the ""vegetarian/vegan food"" movement.......Yahoo!!!!!"
2015-09-04,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Serena Sicilian Influenced Cucina,"Serena's has a serious noise issue. The music was so loud that my head was buzzing when I left. No, I was not drinking tonight.  We couldn't easily communicate with people 18 inches from us. If I ever go back I'm going to use the decibel app on my phone. It was easily 100 decibels tonight. Then I'm going to call OSHA and report them.  The poor wait staff is being exposed to unhealthy levels for long periods of time. I suggest that the manager/owner investigate and set a limit on their volume control."
2015-09-04,4.0,"Vernon, CT",Plates Neighborhood Kitchen,"Wonderful place. The environment is dreamy and the service is wonderful. My food (as well as everyone's I was dining with) was delicious, interesting and perfectly portioned. I really enjoy the seasonal, local approach to their menu. However, the best part of my experience was the perfectly balanced cocktails they served. Unique twists on classics that were treated just as the food: refreshing and locally inspired. Check it out for yourself!"
2015-09-04,4.0,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",Barry’s Cafe,Our FAVORITE breakfast place! Everything is always great but the biscuits are my favorite out of majority of others I've had in the area. It gets jammed on the weekends especially in the morning. We usually go on Sunday's and sometimes it's 5-10 other times it's close to an hour. Prices are very reasonable and the omelettes are delicious. Seriously this is the only place we will go out for breakfast to.
2015-09-04,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",La Carreta Mexican Restaurant,"Stumbled upon this newly opened restaurant today and decided to try it. Great atmosphere, table-side guac-making, and patron margs! Food was pretty tasty too! Buuuuuut the service was definitely not up to par -- never refilled our drinks, never returned with requested items, took a good 20 min to get our checks...at lunchtime! Hopefully they can get in the swing of things with the service after they've been open for a bit longer."
2015-09-04,5.0,"Fairfax, VA",Flying Saucer Draught Emporium,Service was great. Food was very good and the beer selection was unreal. Definitely would come back here again.
2015-09-04,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Calavera Empanadas And Tequila,"I went to Calavera and ordered an empanada and nachos. The empanada had a nice, soft flaky crust that was delicious to eat.  They've really mastered the baking of their empanadas.  I ordered the picadillo which had ground beef, potato, onion, tomato, and green chile.  It was very tasty and there's a decent amount of filling inside.  The ground beef was seasoned very well and all the vegetables were cooked well.  You also get some fresh salsa to dip the empanada into as well.  Empanadas in general aren't that big, so I would honestly have to order 3-4 to be full for dinner. I ordered the carnitas nachos also and it was huge.  You get very generous amount of juicy braised pork that was seasoned well not top of a bunch of chips.  Everything was covered with their queso sauce.  The queso had a thicker consistent and wasn't most flavored queso I've had, but it was cheesy and melty enough to hold everything in place.  The nachos is the way to go if you want the most food here. Overall, Calavera is known for empanadas, and I thought they were really good at making them.  It may seem pricey at $3.50 each, but it's worth trying.  The Nutella banana dessert empanada is also really good and is a great way to finish your meal."
2015-09-04,5.0,"Benson, NC",Waraji Japanese Restaurant,I was very disappointed in this restaurant. My family drove almost an hour for a special treat. We saw the other great reviews and had been told it was a great place to eat.  We however did not have the same experience. I got food poisoning from a bad scallop. I know it was the culprit. The presentation of our food was subpar. It was a hot mess in a wicker basket.The service was ok.I called to report the food illness got transferred to the manager who was less than helpful. Took my information said if more reports she would follow protocol. I asked if they would do anything since I missed an entire day of work. She said she would give the information to the owner. She would do nothing else. The owner never contacted me. I told the manger that I would be writing this review and she seemed to not care.Since my visit. I have gotten more people stating that this restaurant is going down hill. It is not the same as it once was and that sushi Chiefs are leaving to go to other restaurants.I normally don't write bad reviews but wanted people to use caution
2015-09-04,4.0,"Cary, NC",Kimbap,"After reading a bunch of Yelp reviews, I decided to try this place out even though every single review coming from an Asian was negative. I should've known this place was meh the moment I walked in since there were absolutely no Asians. Red flag. The waitstaff is awesome though! Everyone was super friendly and on point. Nice job. Star for the service!We had the japchae, pork and ginger mandu, ssam bulgogi, and nori ""tacos"". The housemade kimchi was actually pretty good although there were carrots added into it. Odd. The daikon slaw was so incredibly vinegary that we couldn't even eat more than a bite of it. Like it gave you the shudders from how much vinegar was in it. The diced taro was interesting. I'm surprised that a fusion restaurant would serve taro. Bold move. Sooooo these housemade mandu. The skins were definitely store bought. The filling had almost no pork and way too much ginger. Was there even cabbage inside? The pork was also not prepared correctly for mandu. Whomever made the mandu didn't take the time to tenderize the pork. Frankly, I felt like the mandu came out of a bag. I was confused by the dipping sauce. Since when is mandu served with only soy sauce? Maybe all the vinegar was used in the daikon slaw? The japchae was okay. Definitely missing something; it was like eating an incomplete dish. Ssam bulgogi was mediocre. It was served with thinly sliced eggplant which was NOT listed on the menu. The nori ""tacos"" we're the best dish we tried. The pork belly was grilled perfectly. Major props for that. The rice was odd though. And I know my rice. I'm Asian. I think maybe they used the wrong grain and didn't add enough water while cooking. It was weird. I am aware that Kimbap is just a fusion and I shouldn't compare it with real Korean restaurants, but all the dishes were just okay and seemed like they were missing an ingredient. Maybe I'm just spoiled and have eaten too much authentic Korean food. Definitely won't waste my money here again and will hit up Seoul Garden, SMart, or the new HMart for my bulgogi fix. Also, why is this restaurant called Kimbap if THEY DON'T SERVE KIMBAP?! Did they just randomly select a Korean dish out of a list and decide to name the restaurant?"
2015-09-04,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Ni Asian Kitchen,"Thai Basil Tofu....best I've ever had. Great flavor, tofu perfectly cooked, fresh vegetables"
2015-09-04,4.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Sawasdee Thai Restaurant & Bar,"I've been to this place a couple of times, and with my most recent visit, I was fully ready to give this place 4 stars. HOWEVER. I didn't anticipate this place being just as good as the other location on Capital Blvd.The food was really great quality. Upon my most recent visit here, I got the Spicy Tonkatsu Ramen, and my friend got the Pad Thai. I've had some amazing ramen in a couple of places around the world, and I'd have to say it definitely was a solid bowl of ramen. The Pad Thai was pretty flavorful, and the noodles weren't bland or undercooked (like I've had at some places). The Thai curry here is an excellent choice as well.Decor is quite nice, as it has a pretty chill, decorative tone. The service here is excellent, as well. I definitely plan on coming back. I feel like I'll start having dreams about that ramen."
2015-09-04,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sassool,"Great food, efficient cafeteria-style service. Healthy, fresh, well-prepared food. The desserts are very good. A staff that is almost always friendly and helpful, even though they get super busy.One thing: lately, it's been like a daycare in there, with an average of maybe a dozen children running around and screaming (I mean screaming! the piercing, call the authorities kind) in the small, echoing dining area. Even at one of the small two-person tables, there has been absolutely no way to have any kind of conversation. Sassool is by no means for date nights, but a great place to grab a quick bite or get some take-out of great middle-eastern food."
2015-09-04,4.0,"Knightdale, NC",Red Pepper Asian,So glad that we've found this little hidden treasure. We have not had really good Asian food since we moved here from NY.  This restaurant has excellent service and very tasty food. It is also a nice quaint family friendly restaurant!
2015-09-04,4.0,"Oklahoma City, OK",Sono,"There is nothing bad here....drinks, sushi, ramen. All of it! Get in my belly!!!! We started with sushi, but after reading some reviews we decided to try the ramen. Definitely the best ramen I have ever had, and I lived off the stuff for four years. Cannot recommend this place enough!"
2015-09-04,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gravy,"This was my favorite restaurant week find. I wasn't even hungry, so the meal fed me for days and was still good as leftovers! I started with the risotto balls. If you've never had risotto balls before, I guess they're good, I know a place that does them better so I wasn't excited about these ones. But the eggplant pie was very good. I got the tiramisu and it was amazing, very fresh. Best tiramisu I've ever had. We each tried a cocktail as well, I had some sort of ginger martini. I liked it, very strong ginger flavor but I love ginger."
2015-09-04,5.0,"Fairfax, VA",Big Ed’s City Market Restaurant,Best breakfast I've had in a while. Service was top notch. Reasonable prices. I will frequent this establishment next time I'm in Raleigh.
2015-09-05,4.0,"Pinehurst, NC",The Daily Planet Cafe,"By far for the price, worth the stop. Selection is amazing. My Caprese was fresh and delicious"
2015-09-05,5.0,"Knightdale, NC",Tenko Japan,First time here. The express bowl portion is mostly rice. Orderedthe steak bowl and the meat flavor was lacking.  The miso soup is bland. God forbid if you request an adjustment to the sushi for dietary concerns - they won't accommodate you. There is no soy sauce on the tables; you have to open packets! I will NEVER come back. Stay away!
2015-09-05,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mami Nora’s,"Oh man, this place is finger licking good!I got the Quarter Dark Chicken, Tostones, and Black Beans and Rice mixed. I also had the Yuca Fries. The Green Sauce is so good and spicy. The Yellow sauce is very tasty as well but I'm partial to the good spicy green stuff. FYI: I tried to just order a chicken leg and two sides but they definitely don't do that. Also I was a little disappointed with the cleanliness of the dining room but it wasn't so bad I didn't eat there. I think next time though I would just get my food to-go. Buen Provecho todos!"
2015-09-05,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Anvil’s Cheesesteaks,"My first time to this restaurant.  First impressions are lasting. I tried the steak and cheese sub, it had no seasoning. The owner and wait staff were not  to friendly. The entire experience was underwhelming."
2015-09-05,5.0,"Graham, NC",Abyssinia Ethiopian Restaurant,"An amazing place for lunch or dinner! Make sure to call ahead of time to get their times. The people working at the restaurant are incredibly nice! I love going here. I have been in Chicago and Raleigh, this is by far my favorite Ethiopian place I have been to. I highly recommend getting the Shiro, it is rememberable and may become your favorite dish :). This place is so good, that just writing this review has made me hungry for it!"
2015-09-05,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chow Pizza Bar,"*Take out order review only* Boo & I wanted pizza & wings & since he'd dined here before we decided to get take out. It was almost 7:30 on a weeknight. I called & placed the order of two pizzas (one make your own & one Chow Down) & an order of the Honey Hot wings.They said 20 minutes, so we rode on over there. Arrived at 7:50 & the parking lot was packed. When I walked in, they were busy. I noticed a lot of high school looking kids working. They have a designated take out area, which I really like. Two girls were working that area. I gave them my name & she went towards the kitchen area. Right back out she came with my order. I like the plain cardboard & simple brown bag the wings came in. We got the food back home & dug in. Pizzas were delicious, hot & toppings were piled on. The wings were yummy, too! Nice amount of sweet & hot.Prices are decent & they have a pretty extensive menu."
2015-09-05,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mellow Mushroom,I've gotten to go pizza here twice now.  Both pizzas were great.  I like the interesting selections and haven't been disappointed either time.They have a nice outdoor seating area and I hope to dine in as the weather cools.
2015-09-05,4.0,"Vass, NC",The Rockford,"Oh my yum.... The husband and I ate here for a late lunch and enjoyed everything, well maybe except the music choice but that's just me. I had the shrimp and grits accompanied by a delicious cocktail, a lemonade, mint, with bourbon concoction. My husband had the pork loin sandwich. I rate my dish 5 out of 5 and he says his was 4 out of 5. Definitely recommend."
2015-09-05,4.0,"Morrisville, NC",Vinos Finos Tapas and Wine Bar,"A fantastic wine bar in a Lafayette Village. The owner is incredibly knowledgeable about his wines (not just tastes, but history too!) and remembers his loyal customers. One of my favorite tapas was the bacon-wrapped dates, surprisingly. Skip the same old franchises and visit Vinos for an awesome night out!"
2015-09-05,4.0,"Apex, NC",P.G. Werth’s,"I have been in both of chef hamm's  restaurants cafe 121 and now p.g. Both are good but this one offers great summer drinks like summer sand delish,  we had the the wedge salad combination of dressing, nuts.  We also had the chips and chicken, everything was fried to perfection and chicken was moist and very tasty.   By the way we were there between brunch and dinner.  Can't wait to go back for dinner"
2015-09-05,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Serena Sicilian Influenced Cucina,"I really like the food and service bar gals are fun and management really seem to care.  There is an issue, the food is always so good but the menu is soooooo hard to understand and order from.  I have been here like 10 times and I really could not tell you what all I had. Looking at the menu, even ordering basic spaghetti or pizza seems cumbersome. The wine menu font is so small I got dizzy looking at it. I could not read a word of it. Again, go there and eat its all good , just tell them to make the menu user friendly."
2015-09-05,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",b.good,"Spicy Avocado and Lime Bowl, that's all I'm going to say...okay not really but holy cow this thing is awesome!I call ahead so there won't be a long wait. They do make the bowls to order so they wait is usually like 5-10mins but it is so worth it! Okay so the bowl, you can get Super Grains or Quinoa. I got it with both one time but (to me) it wasn't an equal half and half mix so I'm not sure I'll be doing that again. All the veggies in the bowl are super fresh not mushy at all. They put what I like is Spanish Queso Fresco (cheese) on top. Halved Cherry Tomatoes also. Either a half or a whole Avocado is sliced and placed on top. It is a little spicy but not bad. I also get grilled chicken top.Oh and the Rosemary Lemonade is super refreshing!!!Go check this place, feel healthy, and enjoy!Happy healthy eating!"
2015-09-05,3.0,"Cary, NC",The Oak,First time - absolutely loved the chicken lettuce wraps and mahi mahi tacos.  Lee said his kale salad is something he would come back for!  Service was a bit laid back for us.  Lee had the burger - pretzel bun - just ok.
2015-09-05,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Barry’s Cafe,"Service was a bit slow, which is what kept it off of five stars.  Everyone was super nice, great family owned place.  I had the half sandwich and soup.  Chicken salad on rye and tortilla soup.  Was very good.  Wife had the cheeseburger salad and loved it.  The slow service was understandable, as it was very busy, which is what you want to see out of a great family place like this."
2015-09-05,5.0,"Atlanta, GA",Garland,Chicken 65 app was out of control! Loved the corn fritters and all of the apps we got that we couldn't pronounce. I'd avoid the praline next time. The bathrooms have very cute pennies as tiles on the floor. All of the decor is boutiquey and refreshingly cool.
2015-09-05,4.0,"Apex, NC",Gonza Tacos Y Tequila,Awesome meal. Wonderful margaritas. Delicious  chocolate flan. Mel our server was the icing on the cake. Enjoyable  time.  Can't  wait to go back.
2015-09-05,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Mecca Restaurant,"I love their breakfast. It's a good option if you're looking for a cheap, basic breakfast downtown, and it's less crowded than Big Ed's. They serve breakfast until 1pm (and sometimes 2pm) over the weekend."
2015-09-05,1.0,"Alexandria, VA",18 Seaboard,"Not impressed at while. The service was great but the food was very disappointing.  Had the shrimp starter that came with blanf coleslaw that was drowning in mayonnaise,  to the point where the mayonnaise pooled on the plate. Shrimp tacos came with undercooked shrimp with a smoked bacon that added a confusing mix of flavors to the dish. Fried cinnamon waffles were the highlight,  but the banana pudding wasn't worth eating. Makes me wonder if the chef is tasting what is served to the customers."
2015-09-05,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Taqueria El Toro,Outstanding local place for Mexican food.  Fresh and well prepared.  They handle a bilingual crowd easily and note on your ticket whether you order in English or Spanish and call your order number to match. I like that they clearly have put a lot of thought into the business and took it up a notch. Kudos to the owners.
2015-09-05,5.0,"Holly Springs, NC",Neomonde Bakery & Deli,"Fresh and healthy lunch option in Raleigh, this is personally my favorite Neomonde location. The line can get very long but it moves quickly! I think that the Lunch Box Special is the best deal since you get a half-sandwich or wrap, two sides and a pastry. I usually always get the half chicken kabob sandwich, pomegranate salad, a hot side item and pistachio baklava. It is always so tasty and filling!"
2015-09-05,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Stanbury,"Great space. Great service. Meh food. Some highlights but too many heavy handed missteps. Chef needs a lighter hand. Better options for your hard earned $$ in the Triangle. Wanted to love the place but just didn't happen for me. That said, I should probably give em a second try in the fall.

2015-09-06,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Glenwood Grill,"I've been wanting to try this place for a while now (a LONG while) and finally made it last night with my wife.  The occasion was our anniversary (28 years!) and I have to say that I wish we had gone sooner.  But with so many great places in the area, it just too a while to get around to GG.  We had 6pm reservation for Saturday evening and we were promptly seated upon arrival.  We shared a Fried Green Tomato appetizer and it was great.  The tomatoes were perfectly cooked in a light breading, and stacked two on a plate with a generous scoop of pimento cheese (homemade I think) for each.  My wife had the crabcakes for an entree and I went with the Seafood and Grits.  Both dishes were excellently prepared and very flavorful.  The balance between the food and the accompanying sauces was well done such that one thing didn't hide or overpower another.  We also tried some dessert - Bailey's chocolate pie fro my wife and bread pudding (topped with cinnamon gelato) for me.  Overall the meal was very nice and service was reasonable and attentive.  I'll definitely consider heading back to GG in the future!"
2015-09-06,5.0,"Butler, PA",Saint Jacques,"Where do I begin? My husband and I went here to try French food for the first time. I ordered the foie gras as my appetizer, the sea bass as my entree, and creme brûlée as dessert. My husband ordered the quail, lamb loin, and homemade ice cream and sorbet. All of these were beyond my ability to fathom that food could be made to taste this good! Seriously though, in spite of all this deliciousness, my favorite part of the whole meal was the palate cleanser served as compliments of the chef after our appetizer... It was a roasted pear and port wine sorbet. I really cannot put into words how much flavor was in such a tiny little spoonful of sorbet. It was like one taste made you feel like you were cozied up in a blanket in the wintertime with a glass of good wine, eating a warm, cinnamony roasted pear. We will DEFINITELY be back."
2015-09-06,3.0,"Danville, VA",State Farmers Market Restaurant,"Decided to go on a Saturday morning after reading the good reviews. There was a line out the door when we got there but we were seated almost immediately. Service was very slow we waited 50 minutes for food. Food was average not exactly farm to table as I perceived this restaurant to be. The sausage gravy was definitely made from a mix not from scratch. Pretty sure the fried apples came from a can too. However, the veggies were fresh. Overall experience was poor-bathrooms too small for capacity and gross."

2015-09-06,5.0,"Knightdale, NC",Babylon Restaurant,"I made a reservation 3 weeks before my reservation date 8-30-15. For 6 people. I got a call the night before telling me they weren't going to be open to the public and we wouldn't it be able to dine there.No apology, would you like to make another reservation, nothing! That would have been the first time for all of us to dine there. I asked to speak to a manager and the same young inexperienced hostess got back on the phone pretending she was the manager. Unbelievable how some places run a business."
2015-09-06,5.0,"Cary, NC",Taqueria El Toro,The food here is amazing and truly fresh. Outstanding tacos and all the food is GREAT!! The salsa bar is so tasty too!
2015-09-06,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",18 Seaboard,Still No update to the food poisoning/lack of customer service with 18 Seaboard. No restaurant is above protecting the health or safety of people. I would steer clear of this restaurant unless you like playing food poisoning roulette. There are plenty of other restaurants in town that actually care about their commitment to their clients.
2015-09-06,5.0,"Creedmoor, NC",Sawasdee Thai Restaurant & Bar,"Did not give 5 stars ONLY because Miso soup was so salty it was difficult to eat, wasted 1/2 bowl. Sushi was fresh & wonderful tasting! I have only found sushi this fresh in Fuquay-Varina at Kumo. Squid salad is served on a bed of lettuce, so ask for without if you don't like that way."
2015-09-06,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Ni Asian Kitchen,Tried this place out today. Very friendly staff and exactly the food I was looking for. The Malaysia Curry Noodle Soup was amazing! Substitute rice noodles in for the egg noodles and this would've tasted almost like the noodle soup I had on the streets of Phnom Penh.
2015-09-06,5.0,"Durham, NC",MachuPicchu Peruvian Cuisine,Great service! Great food! I love the ceviche and seafood dishes.
2015-09-06,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",First Watch,I was pleasantly surprised with my experience at First Watch. I thought initially this was a quick serve restaurant but it is full service restaurant. The service was good and wait staff was very attentive. My server frequently check on my table and others without being intrusive. First Watch has free Wi Fi and they have newspapers available for reading.I have two Gigantic Chocolate Chip Multigrain pancakes and bacon. They give you a pot of coffee when you get there. I will definitely return. A good breakfast spot.
2015-09-06,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sono,"Had a very good experience for dinner at Sono one Sunday night. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful at explaining what the various things on their menu are. They have the best miso soup I've had on the East Coast. The Screamin'  O and the Spicy Salmon Crunch rolls were nicely presented and good overall, although I wish the fish tasted fresher. Green tea and mango mochi ice cream for dessert. Pricey, but then again good sushi is, and a fantastic special occasion place for dinner."
2015-09-06,5.0,"Cary, NC",Pho Far East,"I went on Sunday afternoon and the place was packed. The wait staff was running around nonstop. Everything on the menu looked good, but I got two different kinds of pho for takeout. Although there was an understandable wait, the staff acknowledged me and made me feel welcome.But the food isn't that great. The broth - the best part of pho - is kinda.... eh. It's oily and just doesn't have the flavors I expect. The chicken is a little overcooked, although the beef round seems very fresh. Overall, pretty disappointing considering I made a special trip out there to try it."
2015-09-07,4.0,"Minneapolis, MN",Assaggio’s,"We decided to give this place a try after driving past it nearly everyday and the positive yelp reviews. We ordered on the phone a large NY Style Pepperoni and Mushroom with a side of garlic knots. (Only because of how much other Yelpers raved about it!) The order was said to be ready in 25 minutes. When we arrived to pick up it was piping hot and ready to go.  The garlic knots were fluffy and moist, you must give them a try! The 18 inch pizza was HUGE. The slices had the perfect amount of toppings and it wasn't as greasy as other ny style pizzas I've had in the area. We will definitely be coming back here to give more of their menu a try."
2015-09-07,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Flights Restaurant & Lounge,"The food was all very good!The butter that came with the bread was very salty, but we were able to eat around the rock salt. The Mac and cheese was on point! Shells Mac and the cheese was very creamy with a unique flavor. The bison short rib was tender and flavorful, especially when combined with the goat cheese mashed potatoes. The scallops were sweet and pan seared perfectly. Dip them in the sweet potato purée drizzle that is on the place for an extra sweet kick. The asparagus was grilled, not too seasoned. The restaurant itself is in the front doors behind the first wall of the hotel. But it was for some reason completely empty on Labor Day at 6 pm."

2015-09-07,2.0,"Dana Point, CA",Randy’s Pizza,"After a disappointing trip to Trophy's we wanted to get some really delicious pizza and I have been craving thin NY style pizza for awhile. This place was right near the Arboretum so we did made a day of it. The pizza is AWESOME, giant slices, bendy fold-able crust, stringy cheese with the perfect amount of cheese. Safe to say Randy's Pizza certainly satisfied my craving. The reason they are not getting 5 is only because the garlic knots are just ok, I think they might be frozen and reheated, not always a bad thing but in this case it was noticeable. I probably wouldn't get them again in the future. The sandwiches looked great, but we didn't get the opportunity to test 'em out. Maybe n our next visit...Service was good, no complaints. Price was right for two slices and a drink."
2015-09-07,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Serena Sicilian Influenced Cucina,"The fresh gnocchi is some of the best pasta I have ever had. The wait staff was awesome, and there's a discount on your bill if you eat before six. We will definitely be back."
2015-09-07,5.0,"Wake Forest, NC",Wakefield Tavern,"First timers. Read a few Yelp reviews..looked promising. Went around 7 on a Saturday night. No waiting. Ordered the Philly egg rolls and wings to start. AWESOME. Wings were crispy on the outside tender on the inside. Philly cheesesteak egg rolls were amazing. Yum.

2015-09-07,4.0,"Kansas City, MO",Calavera Empanadas And Tequila,"A good concept poorly executed. On the menu everything sounds delicious, great interesting combinations like jerk chicken with a mango habanero salsa. But, when the food arrives flavors are bland and you can't tell one from the other, and despite that we ordered 4 empanadas with habanero in them, only one was slightly spicy. And they don't have a spicy salsa!  (they'll sell you one...by then we were about done with our food.)  Should be listed as more expensive because you need several empanadas. Our $50 bill for 4 left us still hungry."
2015-09-07,2.0,"Durham, NC",Chuy’s,"Loved this place!!  Really good Tex-Mex food and I loved the nachos.  Even though I'm normally a margarita on the rocks girl, getting frozen margarita's is definitely the way to go.  I love that there is so much outdoor seating and parking is ample by the restaurant.  This is good after work spot."
2015-09-07,4.0,"New York, NY",Lynnwood Grill & Brewing Concern,"I would feel like this restaurant deserves 3.5 stars instead but can't do that so i will give them 4. It is another American sandwich type of place, nothing special.  i ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was good. The level of spiciness did not match with the standard. I ordered medium spicy but i l did not feel any kick of spiciness in it at all LOL, shoulda have ordered extra spicy. It is mediocre at all"
2015-09-08,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Pearl Chinese Restaurant,"This a great place for authentic Chinese takeout. I had the squid and rice cakes. Both were made right and delicious.  The restaurant is older and there are plenty of chairs for customers to either dine in or take out. As a bonus there are live turtles you can stare at while you wait. This place is also cheap, so if you love Chinese food and are a struggling college student this is the place for you."
2015-09-08,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Midtown Grille,"While Midtown Grille was good, I'm not clamoring to come back. Shrimp and grits is my all-time ""must-try"" when I go somewhere, and this was...fine. But there wasn't an element that made it uniquely theirs. The decor is lovely - nice low lighting and modern elements. But I just wasn't blown away by our meal for the price, especially beside some comparable restaurants in the area that seem to dazzle without trying too hard."
2015-09-08,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Square Rabbit,"There are tons of foods options in downtown Raleigh, and this is one of my favorites if you're looking for something quick and inexpensive. They always have chicken/tuna salad sandwiches, and their rotating main dishes are always tasty and balanced. Not to mention all the desserts (the oatmeal cream pie is my favorite)."
2015-09-08,5.0,"Ann Arbor, MI",Guasaca,I'm glad that I read the Yelp reviews that said the line moves quickly because when we got there the line was pretty long and we might have left otherwise.  I had the Signature Fish Arepa and we shared orders of chips and salsa and chips and guasaca. Everything was very good. Even though the line was long we didn't have a hard time finding a table.
2015-09-08,4.0,"Charlotte, NC",Chow Pizza Bar,"Maybe I'm just tired of this being the default for family get together. Maybe I was burnt out on pizza after having Lynnwood Grill pizza and Mellow mushroom on consecutive nights.Our family came in on labor day (thanks guys, for being open) and were attentively taken care of. Waters were never empty, food came out really fast, quality was great! I didn't taste any spite for coming in on a holiday or anything! I gotta recommend the Chow Salad with shrimp, it was an awesome choice. And the sweet potato fries are dank as well.Prices are good, food is good, service is great. The reason for 4 stars? Well... Chow, it's not you, it's me."

2015-09-08,3.0,"Des Plaines, IL",Sosta Café,"A little gem of a place. All I wanted was something reasonably healthy and quick--take out preferred. Once again, Yelp to the rescue. It's pretty unassuming from the outside.  Several outdoor tables with chairs set on the sidewalk, which might be a fine place to dine in the future. But I wanted mine to go...Inside, it is smaller than I expected. But actually the place was quite charming. Very European looking--reminded me of a little café in Italy. Very tidy and clean, several tables, barstools and even a few love seats to sit and enjoy your food. Cool tunes made me want to plow through my work here instead of at my hotel, but I didn't have my laptop with me. Sandwiches and salads, mostly, on the menu. A cooler of drinks and coffees made to order. Anyway, I ordered a Little Piggy, which is vegan but I really couldn't tell. Served with some couscous and chickpea salad on fresh whole grain bread--really tasty. I'm not a vegetarian or vegan--I just like good food served freshly prepared and tasty. This place set me up well.  Served up quick--like in less than 3 minutes. 4 stars for the food. An extra star for the ambiance. I'll be back to try something else."
2015-09-08,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Brio Tuscan Grille,"I've been a few times and the food has been good each time. The service has been okay too, though a couple of times it was slow. It isn't the best Italian place in the Raleigh area. Parking is plentiful at Crabtree Valley Mall so that isn't a problem.I give it three stars for value. The cost is pretty high for basic Italian fare at a chain. You have to really watch what you order, especially wine, or you will be surprised. If it was 25% cheaper for an entree, I probably would change to 4 stars."

I decided to take them here and I'm glad I did! The service was great and the food was delish! We ordered chicken wings for an app and there so seasoned and hot (cooked to order). I created my own entree which consisted of crab cakes and salmon, both were fresh and tasty, along with the sweet potato fries. They both ordered steak and neither complained. Will return :-)"
2015-09-08,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Shuckers Oyster Bar & Grill,"Have visited this place 3 times.  Once when very busy was a bust. The other 2 were great. Mike the mgr was very attentive and eager to fix any problems. The food seems very fresh here and we will be going back. Raleigh needs places like this with fresh seafood, not everything being frozen then fried. Crab dip is great."
2015-09-08,4.0,"Charlotte, NC",Lynnwood Grill & Brewing Concern,"We came in here on a Saturday night with a group of like...25 (unexpected, because planning ahead isn't cool), and these guys did a GREAT job accommodating us.First off, these guys have a great beer selection, plus a full flight of their own brews (which were not too shabby!) We were easily able to get drinks at the bar while waiting for them to clear off our seats.Pro tip: For appetizers, get the dirty chips, BUT substitute the potato wedges instead. Homigawd.For dinner, the lady and I both got pizzas which were super! Mega dough-y crust, but I'm not gonna ding them for that because it's a valid style. Their Barbecued Chicken pizza was on point as well (fresh jalepenos, spicy lovers!).This is a solid place to grab dinner or drinks. A little noisy, a little dark, but you'll have a great time."
2015-09-09,5.0,"West Palm Beach, FL",Vivace,"We were invited to dinner at vivace by a friend in the biz who lives locally. She Had been to vivace numerous times and raved about it, so being in the biz ourselves, we were excited to try it out. It is a stylish atmosphere with open kitchen, our server Kevin was sweet, but blatantly inexperienced. We were informed that he was a bar back and doing great as a server ! We had to ask a few times for more sparkling water (when we asked the server of the next table, a tall guy, he was obviously not happy with the request) also asked another server nearby and then our server and eventually, some 20 minutes later we got more sparkling water! the wine I initially ordered was not available and I was advised that for $50 more I could have a different vintage! Then after I tasted the wine the other two glasses at the table were poured and the server left mine empty! Food was warm when served and I could not eat my ravioli as it was way too spicy, To the point where it overpowered the whole dish. Quail was overcooked, fig pizza was good, carpaccio was good, needed a little salt, risotto had no seasoning and was oily. It just seemed one thing after another was not right and our friend was embarrassed for bringing us here. A female (manager??) came to the table and offered us free dessert which we declined, after our server Kevin had already offered us dessert. We weren't looking for anything free or comped, just good food and good service, which seemed to be ""on vacation' with the Labor Day weekend!"
2015-09-09,1.0,"Morrisville, NC",Moonlight Pizza Company,"A 3.5 star review for sure.First of all, these guys have a private parking lot!!! This makes it much more appealing for me.They do not take reservations for parties with less than 6 people, but luckily we did not need them as on the Sunday night we went, the place was very quiet.  Everything is pretty laid back, but we had great service.  The decor is artsy and modern with lots of interesting prints and paintings on the wall.  They have wine, beer and liquor.  I opted for a glass of the Reisling.  While it was not the best wine I have ever tasted, it was a step up from super cheap box wine.  Next time I will probably just get a beer or mixed drink (please preface with I am also kind of a wine snob).  They are similar to mellow mushroom and Lilly's Pizza. We got the oak city meatball pizza and it was great.  The meatballs were good and it came out fresh and hot.  We decided to go with their signature braided crust and it is really good.  Our friends did a build your own pizza with pepperoni, jalapenos and pineapple.  I had a slice and while it was good, it was REALLY hot.  I'm not sure if the jalapenos were super strong or if they tossed all of the toppings together and then spread them on the pizza because even bites without the peppers were super hot. All of us thought it was too hot, but it was still good.  I would be back.  Next time I'll definitely be trying some of their appetizers as they had a pretty good selection of them on the menu."
2015-09-09,4.0,"Charlotte, NC",Clockwork,"Guys, to be honest, I'm not really sure what I walked into. But I liked it a lot. I'd definitely call this a lounge, and a modern eclectic one at that. I wonder if they were trying to model it after one of the Clockwork Orange clubs...Anyways, even though they were a bit short staffed, the bartenders were attentive, and the music wasn't blaring. Whichever model chair you decided to sit in, whether it be the studded black chair shaped like a hammerhead shark, or the grandmothers pink micro suede chair, they were hella comfortable. That in itself is a great conversation starter with anybody. The drinks were great, BIG wine pours and well mixed cocktails. I also loved that they had their bay door open, very inviting and made the space cool and well ventilated. I definitely want to come back for their food!Gotta give a shoutout to the DJ for the night; they had a pretty weird mix of music from Eurythmics to Christina Aguilera to EDM music... their music choice was as eclectic and unique as their decor. And you know it's a good night when all the guys start singing and dancing to T-Swift."
2015-09-09,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Oakwood Café,"I recently watched the movie Chef and decided I was in the mood for Cuban food.  We went here on a Friday night, and for our appetizer we ordered the empanada sampler for $11.  You get four giant empanadas (2 beef, 1 chicken, 1 spinach and cheese), and four tostones.  The tostones were crispy, soft on the interior, and seasoned nicely with a touch of lemon.  The empanadas were fried and the dough is thick, yet soft on the inside.  They are different than Calavera's empanadas (and cheaper).  The ground beef picadillo was good with nice and juicy beef with olives and peppers inside.  The chicken had the most flavor and a mild spice.  The spinach and cheese was really cheese and just tasted really fresh with the spinach.  They do no skimp with filling here and I love the house made hot sauce they have on the tables.  It add's an incredible amount of flavor to the empanadas.For my entree, I went with the baby churrasco ($15) with a side of plantains and yuca fritas.  The churrasco was at least  8 oz and I believe the cut was a skirt steak, but it was cooked to a nice medium rare with a great char on the outside.  The steak was decently tender, just a little hard cut because of the nature of the cut of meat it is.  Nevertheless, it was beautifully marinaded, dripping and oozing with delicious meat juice.  The chimichurri really set it over the top, and it was definitely a very flavorful piece of meat.  The plantains came out perfect and yuca fritas were also surprisingly very good.  I've never had yuca before, and when its lightly fried, it has a similar consistency to fried potatoes, just not as starchy and a lot healthier tasting.Overall, my meal was very good at Oakwood and also very reasonably priced.  I don't know how authentic the food is here for traditional Cuban and Argentine food, but it tastes pretty good which is all I care about.  I would highly recommend Oakwood and will be back to try more of their delicious food."

2015-09-10,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Imperial Garden Chinese Restaurant,OMG!! Amazing food. Very low key. Been there several times and haven't been disappointed yet. Best Chinese food in Raleigh hands down.
2015-09-10,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",BURGERFI,"A very expensive burger that doesn't live up to the hype. Fries were extra. I wasn't impressed. On top of that, they got my burger toppings wrong so I had to wait and my friend already finished his meal by the time mine arrived.We were still hungry after the burgers and didn't want to spend more than $12 on a lunch so bailed and went home to snack. Not a place to take kids due to cost."

It was full of unique flavours.It's a tiny little place and it does take a while for your meal to arrive. I can definitely see the appeal, but not sure I would be back just because they don't offer a lot for my limited diet. yummy though for sure!"

Hats off to you and I would definitely return and recommend DeMo's based on their exceptional customer service alone."
2015-09-10,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sassool,"There is a reason Sassoul consistently receives as many stars as it's cousin Neomonde! You don't mess with a good thing. Like mexican food, I can eat lebanese just about any night of the week, and the value for the huge plate of food you get is one I can't beat. Usually, it's enough to pick off of the next day as well. My favorites are their chicken salad and lentil dishes. This location also has an impression selection of gluten, dairy, and vegatarian desserts. I warn you though, you have to walk past these first and it makes it very hard with small children to get their order for fruits and veggies in."

2015-09-10,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Another Broken Egg Cafe,"Unfortunately you have those moments in life where you tell your friends from out of town, ""we have to take you to this breakfast place, it's amazing!"" Then you take them there when they're in from out of town and have the worst experience possible. Our servers section she was taking care of was unbelievably large, and it's unrealistic of her manager to think that it would be possible to attend to all of her tables and give the best service possible. We probably saw our server twice, the service was awful, period. Our food took 47 minutes to come out of the kitchen, and surprise, surprise, when it did, it was cold. I generally LOVE the crab cake Benedict, so I recommended my best friend try them; welcome to North Hills Another Broken Egg where breakfast is served as cold as ice cubes. I hate leaving bad reviews but, when you bring your friends from out of town to a breakfast joint, have an awful experience, cold food, bad service, and are overcharged for simple breakfast items, you one, never want to go back, and two, want to leave a review so others don't have the same horrifying experience as we did."

2015-09-11,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",El Pollo Rico Restaurant,I knew this place was going to be one of those great hole in the walls the second I walked in the door. It was busy and every person in the place was latino except for me and my guest. Always a good sign when you want quality Mexican/Central american cuisine. The seating area is very simple and seats probably 30ish people. I ordered the steak tacos which were simply awesome. Served authentic style on two soft corn tortillas. The tortillas were really something special. They were soft and had been grilled a bit to bring out the flavor. Each was filled with a nice helping of chopped steak and pico de gallo. The dish was served with a most sticky rice and pinto beans. I'm something of a taco nut and these were the real deal. The best I've found so far in Raleigh. My guest ordered the chicken version and he enjoyed them as much as I enjoyed mine. They also have a large selection of beer and latino style ice cream bars and frozen fruit which I plan to enjoy in the future. If authentic tacos are your thing definitely check this out. 5 stars. I copied my google review here why type it out twice.
2015-09-11,5.0,"Cary, NC",Taqueria El Toro,"We tried Taqueria El Toro after the good review in our local paper.  I can't speak to it's authenticity, but judging by the number of Latin families around, all speaking Spanish, I'd say it's spot on.  The menu is quite varied, we stuck to the basic tacos each trying a couple of different meats.  The Chorizo was our favorite. The topping bar was clean, and continually stocked.  The carrots and onions were great, and the cilantro fresh.  we tried a few of the salsas offered, but none stood out.  Overall, Great prices, and we noted, with amusement, that all of the orders were called out in Spanish, except ours.  There was a note on our receipt, ""English"", so when our number was called, it was eighteen, we got a kick out of that."

You probably think your life is complete, again, that is because you've never been to Barry's. I can honestly say stepping foot into Barry's was one of the best decisions I have ever made regarding breakfast. Get a cheeseburger and eggs. Just do it. Why you ask? It's a cheeseburger...and eggs...for breakfast...why haven't you ordered it yet?The waitstaff will charm you. Request Heather's section, trust me. Why she doesn't have her own comedy show, I have no idea. Did I mention you get a free after meal cookie? I didn't know that, but you should. The chocolate was still gooey in the middle. It was awesome. Are you a fire fighter or have you ever been on fire and saved by a firefighter? Yes? Then this place is for you. Step through the door and you'll understand. PS jalapeño bacon"

2015-09-11,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tasty 8’s,"As a hot dog lover, especially of new and different tastes, I was excited to give these a try.  I had the National and the Southern.  The good: Both tasted awesome and they weren't skimpy with the toppings (though not heaping either).  Definitely would like to try other types of dogsThe not so good: the buns were that hard chewy consistency like they had been microwaved.  Seriously? You use choice meat and great toppings and nuke the thing? If the only thing you serve is dogs, invest in a bun steamer. Or possibly if you have a steamer they sat way too long in it, and since I ordered right at lunch, that's not good lol. The other big thing is price, though I loved the taste and concept, the dogs are average size and $7 for just a dog is out of my price range.  If it had included a side and been like a meal I can see it, but you have to pay $3 more for a side and drink. Just a bit to pricey for me to make it something I will get again (unless someone else pays.)But if you like a good hot dog, they have them and worth a try."

2015-09-11,4.0,"Durham, NC",Pearl Chinese Restaurant,"Ok, guys, why are you all giving this restaurant such good reviews? This is honestly one of the worst Chinese restaurants I have ever eaten at. I ordered the Kung Pao chicken and the fried dumplings, and my friend ordered the Four Seasons with extra pork fried rice and an eggroll. The Kung Pao chicken had no pow - there was no heat at all and I expect Kung Pao chicken to be spicy. The fried dumplings were only barely fried, and the dumpling's outer covering was very doughy and quite unappealing. My friend said his Four Seasons was very greasy. As a matter of fact, on the way home he kept clearing his throat saying the grease was stuck in his throat. I had to endure his ""Ack ack aaaaackkk"" for quite a while. The total bill was $28 and not at all worth it."
2015-09-11,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Ni Asian Kitchen,"I am extremely impressed with their chicken lo mein!  Way way way better than anything from a typical chinese take out place.   This restaurant is busy during regular meal time hours, but not overly so.  They use fresh ingredients and you can tell they really care about their food amd their customers.   Their chicken egg roll amd the sauce they give with it is on point. I will be coming back often."

I always went with my aunt and cousins. She would buy, hehe. I think I always thought it's too expensive to eat on my own...but I went for lunch and it was really reasonably priced. I didn't get any sushi though. I got the chicken donburi. It was so big and so flavorful. It's much better then the one at Sushi Tsune (it's not bad at ST, just like this one better). They have a lot on the menu and it makes me want to go back just to try the other things on the menu. The waitress asked me if I wanted ""something something"" or Japanese style...I kind of couldn't understand her very well at times so I answered her randomly. Doesn't really matter though, because she was really nice though and kept checking up on us."

2015-09-11,5.0,"Cary, NC",Chopstix Gourmet and Sushi Bar,"Chopstix offers decent Chinese entrees and then also has sushi at buy one, get one half off. I did not get a chance to try the sushi so cannot rate that. I did have the Triple Delight entree (chicken, beef and shrimp) and my date had the Dragon and Phoenix (crispy jumbo shrimp with chicken). The meals were not super hot or steaming and I thought mine was a little cooler than I would have liked. The service was fine and the restaurant is located at the corner of the strip mall where Relish and Dos Taquitos are located. The ambience is a bit dark with booths and then a sushi bar on the right side with a sushi chef preparing the rolls. I used the coupon from the Citypass book so that was extra savings. I did see a lot of people picking up take-out so that seems popular for the restaurant. The lunch options between 11 and 3 on Monday-Fridays also looked very reasonable. It is a decent restaurant and I give them 3 stars."
2015-09-11,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mitch’s Tavern,"I've never had a meal here but the drink prices can't be beat. Last night I had a glass of wine and the hummus appetizer for $7.49 (before tip). The wine alone would have cost at least the much next door at McDaids, and with way worse service. I've always had friendly and efficient service at Mitch's. Lots of vegetarian options too."
2015-09-11,5.0,"Benton Park, Saint Louis, MO",Stanbury,"They were ill equipped and the chef line was at best, mediocre. Coughing in his arm, dropping food on the floor. I just wouldn't come here. Texting while cooking is a thing apparently? I did not know. I do not rate places but I can l tell you this place is poorly advertised as amazing. If you're looking for a fast food version of McDonald's then come here. Oysters served without any sauce or lemon and was told this is  ""French style"" - lived on the riviera for a year and never once saw this. Final notes : hipsters don't equal chefs."

2015-09-12,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Casa San Carlo Italian Restaurant,"Sorry I just don't get the other good reviews but I guess if you like pre cooked food that is smothered in sliced deli style mozzarella cheese then put in the microwave then pay top dollar for it than this is the place for you.There were some positives though. We were promptly greeted and seated immediately at the last table on a Saturday night. We were promptly greeted by our waitress who gave us great serivce and she was very knowledgeable about the menu. The bread was basted in oil and was tasty and the wine was also very good. The ambiance is a little cheesy but also kind of cozy at the same time. Unfortunately the tables are very close together so no.private conversations in this venue.Ok that's were all the good thing end. Our meal came out so fast so there was no way in a packed restaurant that it was freshly prepared. My wife got the lasagna and it was totally covered in deli style mozzarella cheese, part of it steeming hot and the other part cold..can you say microwave! I had the chicken parm and it was just average once again smothered deli sliced cheese and melted in the microwave so the chicken lost its crispy outer coating which was now mush and I don't have to tell you what chicken tastes like when you put it in the microwave! My one daughter had the meatballs and spaghetti once again pasta steeming hot but the meatballs were partially cold in the middle. My other daughter had the meatball sub which she said the meatballs tasted funny so ot tried it needless to say they were not very good and they tasted like frozen ones and definitely not freshly made. The kicker was the desert my wife's favorite tira misu which we took to go. As most people know Carlo use to own Casa Linga in mini city which had really good food and awesome Tira misu it was just in a really and I mean really bad location so she was excited to go home and try it. BOY was she dissappointed she said it was the worst she ever had. The cream tasted like straight butter and the whole thing was extremely sweet so she wound up throwing it out. My wife threw out tira misu!! I could not belive it so it must have been bad.Anyway in my personal opinion Master chef Carlo maybe should go back to his roots or at least back into the kitchen to get the standard of food back to where it needs to be especially for the prices he is charging as he is definitely capable of it. Unfortunately we will not return unless things change."

2015-09-12,5.0,"Charleston, WV",Bahama Breeze,"Food was not even mediocre. We ordered wings and cheese bite for appetizers and ribs for the main dish. None of these items were good, the taste was bland. Also, when we received the wings there was little no meat and the actual wing was still attached, not appetizing at all.Lastly, after our waitress noticed that we hadn't even started to eat our food, didn't inquire as to why. We asked for the check and upon the waitress giving us our cash back asked if we wanted to use that cash as her gratuity....like seriously?!"

2015-09-13,3.0,"Butler, PA",Thai House,"I heard lots of good things about this place and so I decided to check it out... It was so good! We ordered the Thai dumplings for an appetizer, which were very good. The Thai chicken wings were delicious as well. My dinner was the shrimp green curry, which was fragrant and so fresh and good. My friend got the Thai basil chicken, which was phenomenal and I will definitely get that next time. The Thai iced tea is a must-get, too! As a warning though, this is authentic Thai-level spiced food... As in, I chose 2 on a scale of 1-5 for my spiciness and it was SO HOT, hotter than eating a piece of raw habanero hot... Very very hot! So even though I enjoy spicy food, this was just beyond what I can stand. Next time I will stick with 1. Lol. Another recommendation is, don't get the ice cream. It was rock solid and borderline freezer burned. But the other food was so good I feel it made up for it."

I know durian isn't a fruit that a most people like, some people thing it smells amazing, some doesn't. luckily my bf likes it too.

So I guess it will be one of those places that are ok to try, the have a large selection of pizza so maybe some of the others are better, but if you can't get the classics right then I would not want to try anything anything more complicated.

I would definitely come back to this place if I am ever in the area again. Oh I should mention there is no place to sit inside the joint - its all outside table seating. and you order and pick up from the counter yourself. This isnt a sit down and have a waiter place.

When I requested a drink, he let me know that it may not have been in my preference so guided me in the right direction. I ordered the chicken quesadilla and it was one of the best quesadillas I've ever had! My girlfriend ordered the coconut shrimp and was extremely happy with it. Long story short- this place is great and Mario was the best!"
2015-09-13,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Pho Vietnam,"I enjoy coming to pho Vietnam for the noodle soups since this place is so much closer than the other pho restaurants in the Raleigh area. I would give it a four stars if only the quality is more consistent. At times, soups would be great. But other times, it would be very disappointing. I usually go for the pho, unless I want something a little spicy. In that case, bun no hue is my best option. The sandwiches and spring rolls are great as well if you are not into noodle soups."
2015-09-13,3.0,"New York, NY",Irregardless Cafe & Catering,"I had heard so many good things about Irregardless Cafe and it breaks my heart to give them only one star considering how delicious my shrimp and grits ended up being.  But nothing can make up for the horrendous service that we received today.  I understand that you close at 2:30pm, but knowing that my friend was running late, you still accepted to seat us and told me that as long as we ordered before 2:30pm, there was no problem.  I sat down at 2:07pm and told the waiter that I will wait until 2:20pm and if my friend hasn't shown up, I'll order for us.  My friend had time to arrive before 2:30pm, sit down and look over the menu and still our waiter hadn't come back to take our order.  Finally our waiter comes out and tells us that we're ""in luck.  The kitchen closed 3 minutes ago but they'll make an exception"" for us.  Now here's the problem, I'd been sitting here for at least 15 minutes ready to order despite my friend not being there and then this waiter tells me that the kitchen is making an exception for us? Why did it take you that long to take our order?  Alright, next thing that happened was that when my meal came, the waiter didn't bring out my apple sauce.  When I bring it up to the waiter, he says that it's either the potatoes OR the apple sauce that comes with my meal.  I would have sworn that it came with my meal though.  So my friend goes and looks up the menu on the internet and nope, in fact apple sauce comes with it.  Why did the waiter lie blatantly to our face?  Thirdly, the waiter brings us decaf and gives us some ridiculous excuse that he's not ""allowed"" to brew regular coffee.  I worked in a coffee shop and in a restaurant...I have never heard such ridiculousness.  And the kicker of them all! So I ask for a box for my food as the waiter takes our checks and our credit cards.  We were sitting outside.  Then I see the waiter walking inside with our checks AND the box but then stopping at the front of the cafe for whatever reason - my view was obscured.  Next thing you know, he's coming out with our checks and apologizing for not bringing the box.  Wait WHAT? I just saw you through the window WITH OUR BOX!!! And here's the even better part.  When I see him go back inside, I see him running from the front of the cafe to the kitchen with a box in his hands and then come out immediately from the kitchen and come straight to us with that same box.To say that that was by far the most disrespectful service I have ever encountered would be an understatement.  You are probably wondering why we didn't complain to the manager?  Well irregardless was in luck today - we were too fed up and too much in a hurry to leave to bother to even deal with a manager.  But I can guarantee you that there is no way I will be stepping foot back in this restaurant or recommending it to any of my friends.  It's quite unfortunate that one waiter has ruined our experience so much.  But next time that you do kindly sit us 30 minutes before close, don't have your waiters go out of their way to make sure to know that they are going out of their way for us because the kitchen is closed.  We would have gladly gone elsewhere for lunch if you had told us it was too late to serve us.  The extras that this waiter performed was absolutely unnecessary and utterly disrespectful.  I have seen better customer service from people not expecting tips."
2015-09-13,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Big Al’s BBQ,"Best barbecue in the triangle! The barbecue is moist and juicy with a vinegar based sauce. There is a sauce bar with various other sauces that you can use ranging from mild to sweet to ghost pepper hot. They also serve brisket, ribs and smoked sausage. The portion size of the smoked sausage is huge! You can get ""yesterday's ribs"" to go for $12 a rack or 2 for $20. They are just as good the next day as they are freshly smoked. The slaw, collards, okra and green beans are good. I've not tried the mac and cheese. Every time I go elsewhere for barbecue I am disappointed."
2015-09-13,4.0,"Minneapolis, MN",First Watch,"This was my first experience at First Watch. We were seated right away which, on a Sunday morning we were very surprised! They have fresh coffee and water for those waiting for tables (bigger parties when we were there) and the waiter was quick to get us our drink orders. I had the Eggs Benedict which is my all time favorite breakfast food. It was good, but it tasted like something was missing. I believe the hollandaise sauce needed some more seasoning. This place has plenty of options and is kid friendly as well as couples friendly. I'd be coming back to try more of their fare."
2015-09-13,5.0,"Cary, NC",Neomonde Bakery & Deli,"Love this place!  Any place where you can buy fresh pita, olive oil, and spices to take home, and then order dinner and some dessert to eat in is fantastic!  I usually get the beef and lamb shawarma platter.  The sides are always fresh and delicious - you can't go wrong with their tabouli, hummus, or the baba ghanouj. The atmosphere is very casual and it has a great outdoor seating area."
2015-09-13,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Pho Far East,"Even though it was a bit too salty for me, I have to say that Pho Far East has the best broth! I tried this place for the first time last week around 11 AM on a Sunday and was surprised to find it packed. Now I know why!  This will be a regular pho spot for me."
2015-09-13,4.0,"Wilmington, IL",Mi Cancun,"Great food and great service (Freddy was our waiter)! Good vegetarian selection.  Usually vegetarian at Mexican places is a bean burrito. The vegetarian selections have fresh broccoli, squash, zucchini, mushrooms avocado etc. Family related:They give the kids coloring stuff and make a big deal about hanging it up on the wall."
2015-09-14,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Piola,"This keeps coming up in my Yelp feed, and I have eaten here.I met friends for lunch, they ordered a Margarita like pizza which had an orange cheese on it.  Ummm, yuck.  I ordered something that tasted fine while being eaten (at this point, I really am not sure, possibly the Fusilli Blanco), but left a bad taste in my mouth.Not bad, not great, obviously, I must also mention that although my friends LOVE it, I did order a cream dish (I should never do this), so perhaps a red sauced dish would have been better."

2015-09-14,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Frank’s Pizza & Italian Restaurant,"Many, many, many moons ago, I had heard of this place.  I made it over finally with a real Italian.  Neither of us was truly impressed with the pizza.  However, I don't think I ever posted anything, partly because the owner seemed so nice.Then, perhaps a month or so ago, my friend's coworkers (he went and got a different job, so whole new group of folks to recommend places) mentioned they were going to Frank's for a philly cheesesteak.  Suffice it to say, we were convinced.This bread....it is so good!  We have gone every week since that first week and gotten the sandwich.  Don't get me wrong, the meat and all is good, too, but that bread.....Take it from a Southern chick, I may not be an expert on ALL food, but I know what tastes good and it is THIS bread and THAT Philly!  They will let you get it as plain or as topped off as you want it."
2015-09-14,5.0,"Durham, NC",Sosta Café,"I go to this place at least once a week and it never lets me down.

2015-09-14,4.0,"Ashburn, VA",Mo-Te Vietnamese Restaurant,"The beef pho broth was a bit greasier than I like, but it wasn't so much so that it was off putting.  The chicken broth was delicious and would definitely get that again.  Deep fried spring rolls were just ok, but the big draw for me here was the amazing array of bubble tea / boba tea that they served.  Definitely worth a visit just for the tea.  Make sure you eyeball the register to see the two sizes they serve.  I mistakenly ordered the large and it was bigger than a starbucks Venti.  The regular size is the one that everyone serves.  The pearls were soft and not too chewy.  Try the Pina Colada! It was awesome!"
2015-09-14,3.0,"Rolesville, NC",The Players Retreat,"Sushi Friends! No sushi here. But we have to eat something else right? Burgers. These burgers are amazing. 1. Atmosphere- we brought our dog after a hike and ate outside, it's mostly if not all smoke free, which is a huge plus for us! It's also dog friendly and that's also a great plus. There's a TV outside and plenty of shade for those sunny days. 2. Service- the wait staff is very inviting, but not the most attentive. Overall though, really great. We sat down with our Husky and they brought him his own water bowl. Yeah, dog friendly for sure! 3. Location- Raleigh, and not the busiest part. It seems like a little side street. We were there on the weekend and there was little traffic on the street out by the outside eating area. Many people thougj, all dressed very differently. 4. Specials- pretty sure they have been in Raleigh forever, and they are experts at making burgers. Try one. They have an awesome beer selection as well- some neat locals to try. 5. The FOOD- seriously good. I had a burger and side salad and onion rings, and my husband had a burger and fries and I think a sweet potato?  The side salad was excellent with a unique taste and the dressing was AMAZING. I usually make my own but this was awesome. I think it was a spinach salad? The burgers we're fantabulous and really filling. A great place to try! You'll make it a regular spot for sure."
2015-09-14,5.0,"Atlanta, GA",Sosta Café,"First of all, let me just say I don't like to pay for parking when I just wanna grab something quick to eat. This place is nice and trendy looking. The owner was very nice, and apparently there's plenty of frequent customers. So 5 star for the service. But the food was just a ok. Their sandwich was pretty standard, and the sides are bland. So 2 star for the food."
2015-09-14,5.0,"Orlando, FL",Glenwood Grill,"I was very impressed with this place. The outside look in the shopping center gives way to a beautifully decorated interior. You feel cozy and relaxed as soon as you walk in the door. They have a very nice menu that covers all bases. I had the crab cakes, which were very well prepared and served with excellent sides. The service was great as was the pricing, which was very reasonable for the high quality of all the food items."

Born in San Diego and raised in SoCal, Mexican food is my ultimate weakness and I despise crappy, wannabe Mexican food. That being said- Taqueria El Toro is the best I've had here in NC (I give 2nd place to La Superior in Durham and this is a taqueria not a restaurant restaurant). They have excellent tacos, enchiladas, tostadas, and burritos. They have a hot avocado salsa that I love and have a variety of auga frescas. There's not much else to say except that I do recommend- they are very authentic, clean, and great food!"
2015-09-14,5.0,"San Francisco, CA",Casa San Carlo Italian Restaurant,"This place was fantastic! Everything an Italian restaurant should be. I got Iobster ravioli and taste-tested a special one of my dining companions had had. Both were fantastic. Carlos seems really involved in is restaurant and was walking around, asking everyone how their food was and how it was going. As an Italian, I really appreciated this. The one downside is that the cannolis were 3/5, which was a little disappointing. Would def recommend/go back next time in in the Raleigh area."

We have ordered the red curry and pad sea ew.  The food has been excellent both times we ordered it.  I called and had certain requests for the veggies in the dishes and they were created correctly both times.  The staff has been more than helpful during our time there.  They have the open kitchen so you can see the chefs preparing the food.  The first time we went in there was a weird odor but it was gone the second time, it might have been from an old mop or something."

2015-09-14,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Nashers Sandwich House,"Cheerful decor. You order and pay at counter and they bring food to you. When we ordered they told us it would take 15 minutes to make sandwiches. This seemed like a long time and when they arrived they weren't hot hot. When I say they weren't hot, they were barely room temperature. It is hard for me to understand why this is the case as there were melted items on the sandwich. So how to you get melted items on a sandwich without the meat being heated? The flavors were there and the ingredients were delicious, but I felt $8.00 was a lot for just a sandwich. This place was good but I think they need to lower the sandwich prices or add some chips or drink to be competitive with Panera or other lunch places."
2015-09-14,1.0,"Albemarle, NC",Pearl Chinese Restaurant,Great Chinese food for a reasonable price. Inside is not anything special but I usually get my food to go anyways. I would say it's the best Chinese take out I have had in Raleigh.

2015-09-14,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chuck’s,"Not quite the burger destination it used to be for me. The menu changed slightly and one of the things noted is that the burger prices are not listed. There was also a choice for the 5 oz (sm) or the large burger and now they offer 1/4 pound or double. So burgers are smaller but at the same price.  I still appreciate the grass fed beef and the gourmet toppings, but the patty seemed juicier before. It used to be special place and now it's just fine."
2015-09-14,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mi Cancun,We went to this place yesterday and it is really good.  Our server Freddy was great.  The chips were served promptly and they had a hint of lime on them which was nice.  They also brought out each person their own small bowl of salsa.  They offer the lunch menu and prices everyday which I think is good as well.  My wife is vegetarian and their selection is more than just rice beans and onions so she was very excited.  I had the carne asada with enchilada lunch plate.  everything was cooked perfect and presented nicely.  I would highly recommend this place.

2015-09-15,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Oakwood Café,"I had a craving for a delicious and cheesy Cuban sandwich, so after browsing yelp for the best cubanos, we decided to give Oakwood Café a try. We came late on a Friday night, so it wasn't busy. But I can imagine that there would be a decent wait at peak times, because it is a pretty small dining room and looks like it would fill up fast. I also suggest parking on the street and walking a bit, because they have very limited parking that doesn't look super organized to me. Looks like an accident waiting to happen. Anyways, even though it is a pretty small restaurant, I love how cozy the atmosphere was. The servers were friendly and you can tell that they care about their customers and that they had some regular customers stopping in.As for the food, everything was delicious. Even the free bread they served was amazing. I'm not sure what it is that they sprinkle on the bread, but I couldn't stop myself from eating it until it was all gone. We wanted to try a variety of items, so we started with the Empanada sampler with tostones. We were served 4 empanadas (1 chicken, 2 beef and 1 spinach/cheese). The spinach and cheese was my favorite, followed by the chicken, then the beef. If you like some heat, make sure you try it with the hot sauce! The tostones were also really good and had a nice crunch. Before we could even finish our sampler, our entrees came out. At this point, I was already getting full, but the Cuban sandwich really satisfied my craving. And I can never pass up on plantains, so I ordered them as my side. Yum! The item that surprised me the most though, was my fiance's yuca. It reminds me a little bit of a French fry, but with a lemon taste to it. So good!There are some other items that I want to try on the menu so I will definitely be back!"

I ordered the steak dinner. I highly recommend this! I have had some decent steaks in my day but this was the first where I could rave about the freshness and cooked to perfection for weeks. Be prepared to have a huge portion too. The NY strip steak is not a small dinner by any means. Oh, the soy sauce sautéed vegetables hit the spot. Price is pretty reasonable for the portions provided. Overall the staff is very nice and punctual. It can be a bit loud at the bar and overall in the place. It is great for a large group of friends. I would recommend using OpenTable because this place fills up quick on weekends."

All I can say is if the other meals are as good as the home cooked breakfast I had, then I will be a regular customer. Everything was wonderful. The wait staff are on the ball. The portions are just enough served hot and fresh from the kitchen. Clearly this food is made with some love. Sure the place is a bit dated looking but do not be fooled by the older decor. The food will be awesome - at least from our experience. The price is very reasonable. Parking may be a challenge but plenty of public parking options locally. I definitely will be back!"

This is a restaurant with a lot of promise.There's always talk about whether a restaurant is ""authentic"" or not, and I've stopped wading in those waters because they fall prey to the ""no true Irishman"" fallacy. So I really have no idea if this is ""true"" TexMex or not, but I don't care. The meal was delicious. The chef took a few more chances than most Tex-Mex restaurants do with their menu, and I always appreciate a culinary adventure. The wait staff was on point and kept our waters filled up."

2015-09-16,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Casa Carbone Ristorante Italiano,"My husband and I live very close to this place, but only discovered it about a year ago. It is (by far) our favorite Italian joint. The restaurant itself could certainly use some updating, and I somewhat dislike how dark they keep it in there during dinner hours. The service is pretty hit or miss, but the food... Oh...my...goodness, the food! I have never had better sauces. I swear there is crack in it. the Eggplant Parm is the best I've ever had. The pizza is also fantastic. My husband LOVES both the meat and veggie lasagnas. The prices are very reasonable. Bottom line, if you're looking for luxury, you will not find it here. What you will find is the friendly owner/operator greeting you at the door and fantastic food at very fair prices. The nearby Bella Monica (that everyone seems to swear by) pales in comparison with their high priced (crappy)food and wine."
2015-09-16,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Rockford,"How's this for irony...I walked in The Rockford and on the TV above the bar was...The Rockford Files. It's get better because the food is pretty amazing. I had the fish tacos with a pineapple-jicama slaw and chipotle aioli.  They had recently switched from using tilapia (mushy, ew) to using mahi mahi. Big difference and much more tasty.  I also tried the mac and cheese. Warning, it has spicy kick to it. I loved it. The dining area is a little awkward because the restaurant is located upstairs so the stairs cut it in half sort of. They also have a teeny tiny patio area with three tables right up on top of each other.  Don't try to have a private conversation out there. This is definitely a hipster type of place but I'm not holding that against them.  The service was great and the food so good. I am definitely a fan."

2015-09-16,4.0,"Washington, DC",The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar,"Beef and Fish, A combo made in heaven. Everytime I come to Raleigh, I always think of Cowfish and their bento box (contains mini burger sliders, traditional sushi, pickled cucumbers, panko veggies, etc). It's located under their ""Burguishi "" entree, which sounds like a frankenstein monster but the food under that menu is thought out and sounds delicious.The menu can be kind of intimidating as there are well over 60 options to choose from, ranging from sushi to steak. That's what the waiters and waitresses are for! They actually knew every single item on the menu and provided clarity for some of the ""foreign"" ingredients (like uni and hamachi).I always either get the ultimate bento box (beware the meal can be small if you are hungry) or the sushi. It's pretty expensive but damn is it delicious. The entrees I usually get are about $20 or more. As for appetizers, the fried pickles are generous from what I remember. My buddy got the seared tuna and it was phenomenal. As for the restaurant itself, a greeter is always at the door and opens it when you walk in and walk out! The bar is situated right when you walk in. There are funny posters lining the walls that are japanese-themed (look out for the one with the Burger King and Wendy's girl). There's a huge aquarium in the middle of the restaurant that is mesmerizing. Spoiler:If you have a birthday, a few employees come out with a gong and cake to sing to you the shortest birthday song in the world (maybe lasts 5 seconds)."
2015-09-16,4.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Plates Neighborhood Kitchen,"I loved Plates! My sister and I had a pretty difficult day at work so we wanted to indulge in some good food for dinner. After learning about Plates via TRW (triangle restaurant week), it was at the top of my list of DTR (downtown Raleigh) restaurants to try.Their location on Glenwood makes their outdoor seating a prime spot for people watching and to enjoy the end of summer breeze (even with the mosquitoes trying to get their last blood draws for the year).The host and server were both incredibly friendly and helpful. The host helped us narrow down our choices; and when he couldn't help me out with a drink, he relayed it to our server who knew her wines.The food came out in a timely manner and tasted fantastic. They served us complimentary rosemary bread and whipped butter to start - loved the aroma and freshness! We moved on to their crab and sweet potato beignets. These were like a fluffy, light crab cake (which I LOVE). I wish there was more sweet potato flavor, but it was still good, especially with the dipping sauce that had a slight kick to it.For our entrees, I opted for the stuffed chicken breast and my sister got the plates burger. The entree portions were perfect in size, in my opinion (though I did eat again a couple hours later. I love the idea of ""more bang for your buck"", but not when it comes to fresh food that I know won't taste the same reheated. It was nice to enjoy and finish this meal in that one sitting). The stuffed chicken breast was sooooo tender and juicy. It had a bit of an Asian citrus flavor. The ricotta and tarragon stuffing wasn't too heavy, which is always a concern for ""stuffed anything."" The sautéed wild mushrooms were on the saltier side, but the sweetness of the quinoa and figs offset that and made for a balanced dish. My sister's burger was more of a crumbly beef patty topped with pulled short rib (no bun) that was seasoned to perfection! The Gruyere cheese was kind of a miss because it was suchhhh a thin layer that you could hardly taste it (or even see it) and it didn't do much for the dish, but the truffle mayo sauce was so good that I didn't even care. The burger came with a fresh side salad that had an Asian-flavored dressing that was light and delicious.We ended our impromptu 3-course meal with dessert. I chose the crème brûlée and my sister got the mousse. The server came out with something else for my sister because the chef said he didn't like the consistency of his mousse (no charge, of course). The dessert they brought out wasn't bad but definitely wasn't something either of us would order or really enjoy. So thank goodness I got the crème brûlée because it was perfect!The combination of the tasty food, relaxing atmosphere, and friendly waitstaff made this a wonderful dining experience! I'll definitely be coming back to try their other dishes once the menu changes again."

The servers are always pleasant, the atmosphere is nice without being stuffy. The real kicker here? The best damn meatloaf I've ever had. Hands down. And, if you go at lunch it's basically a steal. It comes with chèvre whipped mashed potatoes, and sautéed spinach. Yum! For $10? It can't be beat. And don't forget the she-crab soup. It's to die for. Love this place."

Hands down the best Mexican food I've had. Another reviewer mentioned believing the food tastes like it's made with love & I absolutely agree. So flavorful! Perfectly prepared! Top notch!Let's back up and talk about other parts of the dining experience. The restaurant decor is eclectic to say the least. Various colored walls, murals, picture frames, skulls, crosses, mirrors, and many tea lights. One could be preoccupied for hours viewing all the intricacies. I found the ambiance to be very cozy. The staff provided a pleasurable experience with quick, relaxed, and mannerly service. The margaritas were just what i'd hoped.Back to the food!! Plain 'ol chips and salsa: delicious and fresh, exceeded my expectations. I ordered the frijolada which consisted of many types of beans in a tomatillo-chipotle sauce as well as rice and a poached egg. The rice cooks the poached egg immediately upon breaking the egg when stirred around, so it tastes similar to a fried rice but healthier. Every flavor in the dish was well rounded and just, mm, superb! I could cover all my food in that tomatillo-chipotle sauce from here on out if I could. My friend ordered the enchiladas and sang their praises as well. Quite the variety in that dish- 3 different enchiladas covered in 3 unique sauces. The portions are ample. We had no room for dessert but couldn't resist. Bread pudding with goat's milk icecream- almost other earthly!!I certainly recommend this establishment to everyone. Heck- I'd like to go back and try everything else on Centro's menu! Delicious!"
2015-09-16,5.0,"Apex, NC",Capital Club 16,"Great location, clean, trendy. Beers are cold and food is pretty good. Service is ok. Staff are pretty cold or maybe too cool to be personable and friendly. I am not asking anyone to stretch beyond their comfort level nor be cheesy for sure but a little something goes a long way. It could be the hipster attitude that I am just not really into but that's ok. We went in last night to enjoy #WKNCbothkindsradio - fat sac spin some records. Sound is not good but hey, if the food and environment hits it than that's all that matters. To match the guest dj, the restaurant had a honky tonk theme. My husband got the country fried steak. The presentation and entree was excellent. I ordered off the menu and the Currywurst appetizer. The fries were fresh fried hot and tasty french fries and the curry added a nice touch. However, the currywurst was soaked in curry seasoned ketchup. Not a big deal but when the entree came, I thought that the cut up dogs would be warm and it was *just* warm (barely). Again, not a big deal but the host or server should have told me when I asked (after it arrive at the table) if the app should be cool that it really should be because basically the currywurst dogs were tossed in a heavy amount of curry seasoned ketchup. Not a bad thing if you are a ketchup fan (which I am not). So I am going to take the blame for not asking more questions and assuming the appetizer protein would warm"
2015-09-16,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",42nd Street Oyster Bar & Seafood Grill,"We had dinner during restaurant week, but ordered off the regular menu. Overall, the experience was a mixed bag. The place has a great atmosphere, the cocktail menu was varied and delicious and the crab cakes that I ordered were much more ""crab"" than ""cake"" - so good!There were two things that made the experience less than perfect. The waitress's recommendations were always the most expensive items on the menu - for drinks, appetizers, and entrees. As former servers, my husband and I know that your best/most unique items are not always the most expensive. We went with the oysters she recommended (the most expensive) and when she brought them to us she told us they were the last ones and apologized for how small and unappetizing they looked! We were surprised to have been served them and charged full price for something that was admittedly sub-par. Unfortunately the night ended up feeling more like a sales experience than the nice meal that it could have been."
2015-09-16,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bida Manda,"Best restaurant in Raleigh and we're very privileged to have it. Lao restaurants are rare and most are on the west coast. A friend if mine in DC recently told me that they just got their first also restaurant so we've beaten a lot of much larger cities with this one. Now, I've never been to Laos so I can't make a comment on the food's authenticity but I can say it's absolutely delicious.The food on the menu is similar to this food in many ways. They offer curries, larb and papaya salad, for example. However, they also offer dishes I've never seen before (Lao sausage, the oft mentioned pork belly soup) and I feel like the spices are slightly different than this spices (both the larb and the papaya salad are spicier and better than what I've had at most thai restaurants). The papaya salad with dill trout is my go to dish. The combination of dill plus spicy pepper is unexpected and amazingly complex. The beef larb is amazing too. despite the upscale atmosphere, Bida Manda is actually a really good value. Yeah it's more expensive for dinner than standard take out thai but the portions are large and the quality is top notch. For lunch, this place is a steal. They have almost all of the same items for lunch as they do dinner just in slightly smaller portions and most of the lunch entrees are under 10 dollars!Since this place is so great, you do typically have to make reservations for dinner, even on week nights. Make them in advance too or you'll be eating at 10 o clock at night! If you do wind up having to take an off peak hour dinner reservation though, I can assure you the food is worth the wait!"
2015-09-16,5.0,"Congress Park, Denver, CO",Kai Sushi and Sake Bar,"Amazing sushi and even better service. Always fast and friendly. Definitely the best sushi place in North Raleigh ! Can't go wrong with anything on the menu here, it's all delicious!"
2015-09-16,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sardi’s Den,"Great atmosphere! Wonderful menu choices that you can customize.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, was that we asked for a MR burger and it was well done."
2015-09-17,3.0,"Kearny, NJ",Pam’s Farm House,"Stopped in here on my last day In NC for breakfast. Got a hotcake, fatback, and scrambled eggs with cheddar. Pretty standard stuff. The hotcake (pancake) was cooked just right and it was massive!! Some pieces of the fatback were rock hard and i couldn't chew through them. Saw some people getting what looked like delicious chicken. So give it a shot for yourself and ENJOY!!!"
2015-09-17,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bida Manda,"3.5 star for food, bump it up to 4 with the nice ambiance. The place is cute, I like the decor, china, tiny bamboo box for sticky rice(which I like a lot, it's like eating a dessert rice), and staff are nice. The kitchen is not the fastest, usually you'd expect a little wait on food, but in a nice sit down place it's okay. But here comes the con: I really tried to like this place and I don't mind going here for lunch, but food just doesn't taste that great. I do have to admit, I am extra critical about my Asian food. You have to win my taste buds to get me to put down a 4 stars, although in this case I bumped it up because I appreciate an Asian restaurant downtown among other western food, being different and refreshing.The food is always on the saltier end. The lacking of the clear crispy flavor profile is what's missing here. I want to say most of the dishes here share a common undertone, which is not always great--because there's Thai food, there's Vietnamese food, and there's Chinese food on the menu. They DON'T all taste the same. I hope the next time I return, they come up with something amazing."
2015-09-17,5.0,"Durham, NC",Despina’s Cafe,"They've extended their weekday hours to 6pm!  That meant I could meet my bride here for a quick sandwich before we had to go off to some separate functions for the evening.Sandwiches are good, especially when they're panini style.  The roast pork panini is no joke - very very good - it's not a cuban sandwich, but there are some similarities.  My wife only ate half her wrap, so I had the other half - again, terrific ham/cheese and everything else that was on it.  I didn't care much for the pasta salad (I can't stand the mixed veggies they had in them).Lemon scones - pretty good.  The rest of the dessert case I had to avoid looking at for fear that I might end up in diabetic shock!Nice shop, cool decor.  I like it."

2015-09-17,5.0,"Kearny, NJ",Flying Saucer Draught Emporium,Came here twice. They have a fantastic beer selection and a friendly staff. We had Hannah wait on us the first day we went in and she was great. Super friendly and helpful at recommending and letting us try beers. She was so friendly and the beer so good that we returned the next night for a few more beers. I'll be returning to Flying Saucer when i'm back in Raleigh. Next time i will be trying the food also. ENJOY!!!
2015-09-17,4.0,"Holly Springs, NC",18 Seaboard,"I have been to 18 Seaboard several times for lunch and have always had a pleasant experience.  I have found that the food never disappoints and the service is always spot-on too!  I usually have the shrimp & grits;  ....the soirée of succulent shrimp swimmin' in creamy grits is music to ma belly.  I have also tried their meatloaf and it is pretty tasty too.  For dessert I have tried their crème brûlée.  It is fantastic;  however, I have never met a crème brûlée that I did not like, so take my praise with a grain of caramelized, sugary goodness.  I'd like to try dinner here.  Who wants to go?"
2015-09-17,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",La Carreta Mexican Restaurant,"I've eaten dinner here 3 times. The food is good and the fresh guacamole is out of this world. I have found the service to be lacking, however. When I order guac, they always bring the entrees to the table at the same time. Also, the last time I was there, I authorized a charge of $34.16 to my debit card and I was charged $42.10. When I brought this to the attention of management, I was refunded the $8 and got an apology. Unfortunately, this episode put a bad taste in my mouth for this restaurant."
2015-09-17,5.0,"Germantown, MD",The Mecca Restaurant,This is a family owned restaurant and it feels like you are eating with family. The staff is super friendly and make you feel like you belong there. It's a very comforting dining experience. A nice change from all the fancy modern food scene in the area. The food was great & portions are just right so you don't leave with a belly that is about to explode. I would come back again when I am in town!
2015-09-17,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chopstix Gourmet and Sushi Bar,"We really like Chopstix. Over the past couple of months the dining room has slowly been renovated - it needed to be freshened up- and it is now cozy and comfortable. My daughters love the Bento boxes ($9.95). The staff is very flexible, they happily substitute sesame chicken for chicken teriyaki for us and will serve Bento all day if you ask (it is a lunch item). The Bento box is pretty standard; a good selection of meat and seafood, white rice, egg roll, California roll and choice of soup. We love the wonton soup.The sushi is a great value at buy one, get one half off. I've tried many different rolls and always been happy with the quality and presentation. Also, they offer rolls made with soy paper for people who don't like nori.One nice touch is the bowl of fried wonton strips with duck sauce that is put on the table when you sit down. Also, the staff remembers us and is super friendly.Chopstix isn't in our neighborhood- we wish it was- but every time it is worth the drive."

2015-09-17,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Jimmy V’s Osteria & Bar,"This stuff is WAY over priced, I can't believe I paid 12 dollars for an 8? dollar burger (at best)it was burnt too, and I am just super unhappy tbh.  I was starving and haven't eaten any meat in days, so I scarfed it down but like thats the thing, nothing was worth experiencing. it was just food.The wings are a good portion, flavor is good but I was hoping they'd be hotter (chipotle mango ones)"
2015-09-17,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Soo Café,"We ordered the Pork Fried Dumplings, Beef Bulgogi, and SoGa wings.  Fried dumplings were good inside but may have been overly fried which gave it a stale texture - would not recommend ordering.  Beef Bulgogi just wasn't that good relative to other Korean places I have been to.  The SoGa wings were good and crispy but I felt like death after eating here and could not go back.  Location and decor are not a deal breaker for me if the food is good, but if it is important to you this place not for you!  Disappointed after the good reviews and I really wanted  to like this place better then I did!"
2015-09-17,1.0,"Medina, OH",Fu Kee Express,I have to admit that I stopped in this place mostly because of the name.   However after ordering the Kung Pao chicken I have to say this place is FU KEE great. (Someone had to go there)  The place is one of the cleanest Chinese take out places I have been to and the food was excellent.   I'll definitely be back.
2015-09-18,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Lee’s Kitchen,Grabbed dinner on a Friday night.  This place is a hidden gem on Capital Blvd!  Got the oxtail and curry chicken dinners.  Both were excellent...although we loved loved loved the oxtail.  The  meat was was so flavorful.  the oxtail sauce over the beans & rice enhance the flavor of the rice.  The veggies and plantains that came with the dinners were delish too.  Every bite of dinner all around was enjoyed!
2015-09-18,5.0,"Wake Forest, NC",Los Cuates,Love it!!!! As a San Diegan its hard finding Mexican food that reminds me of home and they brought me back to many late night burrito runs. Similar style to Santana's or Alberto's. If you havent tried a shredded beef taco from here you are missing out in life. They also have pretty good Cali-Burrito.
2015-09-18,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sosta Café,"Going to Sosta is like Christmas and my birthday combined into one. The food is spectacular and original. I could eat The Alpine everyday until I die. And it's not just the food that's top-notch, Jerome is the best restaurateur in Raleigh and the nicest to boot. A great place to eat and chill. Your loss if you don't stop by!Cheers"
2015-09-18,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kabab and Curry,"I have such mixed feelings about this place! And I will tell you why. The first time I came here was because it was one of the only places I could get Indian food near me between 3 - 5 pm. My friend and I ordered Raja Thali & Rani Thali. We both ordered ours medium, but none of our dishes were very spicy at all. They were very delicious, though! We followed our meal up with a mango lassi which I could barely stomach from being so full! Now here comes the strange part! A few friends and I came here upon my recommendation a few days ago to split the Raja Thali. It was a little more crowded than usual and the table that we were sat next to, presumably some college kids, were having an extremely loud conversation which was bugging us, but not to the point where we would leave. After bringing our water, our waitor took our order. I asked for tandoori to be switched for saag like I did last time I came (which they did with no problem) but this waitor got in my face (as in waaaaaay invading my bubble) and was being extremely rude for no reason, as if I was an idiot for asking; it made me so anxious that I had to walk out. I wish I had the guts to tell the guy off and tell him how rude he was, but I just wanted to get the hell out of there!!! I'm never going back."
2015-09-18,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Shish Kabob,"The meat on my gyro was dry and crusty, the salad was limp and old too.  Bummer, as this place used to be great. Sidenote: I asked for water and they charged me for (and later gave me) bottled water - typically when there is a self serve soda fountain, ""water"" means tap water - other establishments usually clarify before charging a customer."
2015-09-18,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Mecca Restaurant,"Been eating here for 15 years, it is always hot, fresh, and delicious. I am a sucker for the cheeseburger and fries, and breakfast is equally amazing."
2015-09-18,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Ni Asian Kitchen,"I was really pulling for this one.  There's a desperate need for a good Asian restaurant around the six forks/Strickland area unfortunately Ni Asian isn't one of them.  It's a good location, the staff is friendly and helpful and the place itself is nice and clean but the food is subpar.  The Mongolian beef was tough to chew.  The general Tsos had a weird lemon flavoring to it and the pad see ew was just meh.  Might have been an off night, who knows.  Or perhaps they simply need to retrain the cooking staff?"
2015-09-18,4.0,"Morrisville, NC",First Watch,"One of our favorite breakfast places! The service is always wonderful we love when we get Ashley, she remembers our orders even if months have passed since we've come in!

2015-09-18,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sardi’s Den,"The food is great. The service, less so. It took 2 hours for our family of 4 (2 kids) to eat dinner here tonight - and all we had was entrees - no salad, apps or dessert. The kitchen was slow, and ran out of potatoes for the baked potato my husband ordered. They compensated with extra sides, which was nice, but I do wish they hadn't taken over 50 minutes from the time we sat down to bring out our entrees.It then took another 20 minutes for us to get our check, when it arrived it was wrong, and then it took another 10 for it to come back.Our server was clearly not on her game tonight, but I also fault the management. It was very clear the server was running all over the dining room and even outside, as they don't seat servers in sections. In addition to our table, she had a 7-top, 2 other 4-tops on the other side of the restaurant wall, and 3 2-tops outside. Finally, I'm not sure what she was having to do in the kitchen, but she would disappear back there for 10-15 minutes at a time all night. They were busy, but there was no good reason for our server having so many tables or being so harried running from table to table.I really hope this restaurant gets their act together, because the food was quite good, and the prices are reasonable. It's a family friendly place and they offer good drink specials."
2015-09-18,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mi Cancun,"This place was open a couple months ago under a different name and seems like it changed owners a couple months ago so I decided to give it a try since it is the closest next to my house. The location and the building are fantastic but the food is the crappiest i' try from a Mexican restaurant; mind you I am not a picky eater and I love Mexican food on most of the cases so I went to order something I know a good Mexican restaurant cannot miss: carnitas. The food was disgusting! I mean, it was like the froze my food from weeks before and they microwaved it when I ordered; the only thing I ate was the avocado salad with the lettuce, I left everything else. I asked the waiter if the food was frozen and he said it was not but I know for a fact that thing was not fresh at all! After seeing my plate left almost untouched, the only expectation I had for them was at least not to charge me for that trash.....$11 I ended up paying for the most disgusting food I have tried lately, no apologies, only a ""oh I am sorry, we will do it better next time, here it is your bill""...... There won't be a next time guys, if a Mexican restaurant cannot cook carnitas, just close shop, you are dead by default."
2015-09-18,4.0,"Wendell, NC",Lilly’s Pizza,"Having previously worked here I've seen it all. I know most will say that it's long wait and the service is apathetic at best but it's easily fixable if truly enjoy the food (which is amazing and truly from scratch). First off call in. This avoids so much of the confusion and wait time incurred. Tell them if you'll be eating there or to go and how long til you'll be there and they'll have it ready or within minutes of being ready. Also call ins don't wait in line rather they skip to the front and get worked into the line of people ordering. Most don't know this as there is no sign to my knowledge at least but works very well.Also I can't stress this enough, don't be the guy who takes a specialty pizza and turns it into a pepperoni and olive pizza. They have to go thru every single topping add some change some and delete some, and in a loud environment things will go wrong. Also this is very expensive to do being that every topping could run you a few bucks. It's better to just create your own if going to be difficult. Must tries: Dante inferno, Hawaiian, super duper, wings, salads( all salad dressings are made from scratch and are phenomenal. I come back just for the vinegaretts)"
2015-09-19,4.0,"Gastonia, NC",Backyard Bistro,Serious sports bar. Tiered seating to be able to see the huge screens. Lots of burger and salad choices. We had quick good service. The Cobb salad was very fresh and delicious   Burger cooked perfectly medium rare. I will go back for sure
2015-09-19,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",b.good,"This was my second time at b. good. The food took a long time time to come out even though there was only one other group in the restaurant. I think I know why the food took so long, because the burger was way overcooked. The meat was charred and dry, and the dry beef crumbled apart as I was eating it. Not sure if you can specify temperature of the burgers here, but I was not asked. The baked fries that came with it were good. I like the concept of farm fresh food, but if you are getting fresh meat from a reputable source then why cook it until there is no flavor left? At that point it tastes like a burger that you would get from a cafeteria, and not meat fresh from the farm. I think it's a little overpriced for the product that you get."
2015-09-19,4.0,"Terre Haute, IN",The Mecca Restaurant,"Great little burger joint. Fantastic friendly staff, whenever downtown I make it a point to stop in. One of the best burgers around."

Not ok. Under spiced food lacking flavor.  Nice friendly staff, nice decor, had potential but won't go back."
2015-09-19,5.0,"Dunn, NC",Garland,The cauliflower 65 was exquisitely flavorful. We had chicken tandoor as well that was beyond our expectations even though we already heard great things. Simply delicious and a must try for the downtown Raleigh area.
2015-09-19,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Centro,"How is it that we just found this place?! A fan of Jose and Sons, we were looking for someplace new to check out for a post-10 mile run. Yelp never leads us astray! We've actually found our new fave! As all have said, the cocktails are great (as a former member of the spirits industry, I'm a big cocktail snob!). And the food, oh, the food. Granted, I will concede that we were starving and that a rubber tire may have tasted good. But, as a Latina, I would say that the cuisine was the best I've had in the area. We ordered off the brunch menu. My BF had the chilequiles and the portion was very hearty and he thoroughly enjoyed it. I had the Frida & Diego and it was so flavorful and satisfying. We look forward to next time and will be definitely checking out the new Mescal Bar soon."
2015-09-19,5.0,"Charlotte, NC",Neomonde Bakery & Deli,This place is awesome. The food is delicious and the employees treat you like family. I have had two events at their restaurant and one catering event. I would always recommend them because they are so easy to work with.
2015-09-19,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sardi’s Den,"We had take-out from here last night and it was good, so we went back tonight for a sit down dinner. It took 20 minutes for our order to be taken and another 40 for it to be delivered. The customers at other tables were either staring glassy-eyed into space or checking their watches as they too waited for food to appear. Finally it did. My husband's take-out pulled pork had been warm and succulent. On this sit-down occasion it was dry and cold and served on a dry, cold roll. My Jack Daniels burger was good, the fries on the soggy side. In the hour plus that we waited to eat, no one offered to refill my iced tea. I'll be checking reviews to see if this situation continues or improves. We'd like Sardis to succeed, but it doesn't look good right now."
2015-09-19,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gino’s Pizza,"To paraphrase Donny A.'s review,  I know nothing of NY pizza.  At all.  But I can tell you about great pizza in general, and this place has it!  The white pizza was awesome, with just enough garlic for flavor.  The crust was just right, not too thin, not too thick.  Great chewy texture and flavor.  Excellent garlic knots too! You'll be glad you came here."
2015-09-19,1.0,"Morrisville, NC",Sardi’s Den,"The service was excellent.  On a busy Saturday night,  the kitchen was backed up and somehow the food arrived warm,  but not hot. Even so,  the ribs were fall off the bone tender and probably some of the best we've had.  The onion rings were crispy and lightly coated,  really good.  The oreo cheesecake was dense and yummy. Note this restaurant is noisy when it's busy, so if you're looking for a quiet dinner,  Saturday night here may not be your first choice."
2015-09-19,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Guasaca,"The food here is beyond delicious. I love the fresh, flavorful South American vibe. The staff are super friendly and keep the, sometimes long, lines moving quickly.I've eaten here several times and always order one, or two, of their mouthwatering arepas with a side of chips and guasaca (seasoned chunky guacamole ). Today I decided to order a grilled chicken bowl with white rice, caramelized onions, cheese, sour cream and cilantro sauce. Perfection! They were being stingy with the rice so I had to ask for an extra scoop, but I wasn't charged for it. The bowl was more than enough to fill me up. I didn't even start on my chips and guasaca.Today was a beautiful day so I sat outside in the shared patio area with umbrella covered tables. A perfect spot for lunch. Of course I'll continue to dine here because I absolutely love it!"
2015-09-19,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sono,"I dined in this time.. not as great of an experience. It is a cool vibe and you can sit where you look out to Fayetteville and people watch, but the service was super slow. We went on a week night and didn't need a reservation, so I would have expected the service to be slightly faster. Or a lot faster. It took over an hour to get two rolls and some sashimi. Not ideal. I had good company so it was totally fine, but not the best scenario when you come hungry. I think there was a large party on one side, and that may have been part of the issue; however it was interesting that two rolls took that long. The food was great, once we received it! The Angry Tuna was by far my favorite! I'll just order it to go... :) I've always wanted to do their omakase.. I wonder if it would be a little faster that way?"

2015-09-19,5.0,"Sanford, NC",Bella Monica,"Excellent food & this from a guy who's been traveling to Italy on business for 30-years. Good food is global and this place is definitely on the globe, in a strip mall no less but don't let that prejudice your good judgement. The wine list is thoughtful, which many aren't, and offers up surprises not found elsewhere in this area. Go happy and you will leave happy and don't forget the mussels. Best I ever had."
2015-09-20,5.0,"Arlington, VA",State of Beer,"FANTASTIC.  I went here for the first time this weekend and the staff was welcoming.  Nice selection of beer, especially if you're into IPAs.  Sat at the bar and tried multiple beers, though a few were no longer on tap.  Ask for samples if you're feeling indecisive.  Also had the brie sandwich and my partner had the ham.  Food came out fresh but side salad could have used a bit more dressing and accompaniments for me.  Good vibe and people of all ages."

2015-09-20,5.0,"Wake Forest, NC",Taqueria El Toro,I am from the Bay Area California and since moving here a year ago I have been majorly disappointed in the Mexican food out here with the spice level and cheese sauce etc. However this place makes up for all the bad. This place has legit Mexico street tacos and very good like home Mexican cooking. The place is always packed but it's worth the line. The Tortas/ Sopes/ burritos are also good and I love the fresh salsa bar with spicy slaw/ carrots and limes!
2015-09-20,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",BURGERFI,"This would have been a five star review, if the young lady taking our order knew anything about customer service. Although she wasn't nasty, she most certainly was not pleasant. Other than that, our food was great at this location. I enjoyed my VegeFi burger better at this location. It was very well seasoned. This time we shared a basket of fries, so as not to waste them. I also like the fact that this location had deck seating."
2015-09-20,3.0,"Bergen County, NJ",Chow Pizza Bar,"My friend and I split a white pizza and a side order of fries on a recent Saturday afternoon. During the late lunch hours, it was very quiet and service was a bit on the slower side. I'd recommend for a nice leisurely lunch. The pizza was delicious - the feta and caramelized onions added a unique touch to the white pizza. The side of fries was fresh and huge. Definitely got our bang for our buck here. I'd return next time I'm in town! Gastropub-like atmosphere with sleek interior."
2015-09-20,5.0,"Knightdale, NC",Assaggio’s,"This place is amazing lets just start with that. First the garlic knots taste heavenly they have such a wonderful taste and are coated with chunks of roasted garlic. The salads are fresh and are crisp with a variety of dressing options, but are good enough to eat with out any dressing at all. I had the penne alla vodka the pasta was perfectly cooked and the creamy tomato sauce added the perfect taste and texture to the dish. The portions are generous and you are glad they are knowing your lunch is going to be great the next day! If you are in the area this place is worth the stop so come in and try it."
2015-09-20,4.0,"Oxford, NC",Chow Pizza Bar,Service  was quick food was great and my son got extra sprinkles on his ice cream!  Will definitely come back!
2015-09-20,4.0,"Ventura, CA",Shaba Shabu,"I ordered the Gyoza as an appetizer but was very bland, no flavor.   The entree was the Beef Yakiniku (sic).  It was okay, not great, not bad.  I am in Raleigh on business but if I was a local I would not go back."
2015-09-20,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Winston’s Grille,"Great service, great food, great atmosphere. Got the bacon wrapped filet Mignon, and it was cooked very well. Will definitely be back for special occasions/date night out."
2015-09-20,2.0,"Wake Forest, NC",Big Al’s BBQ,Good barbecue with questionably high prices. The restaurant is set up like a walk up fast food joint but the prices are a bit high for what you get. A family of 4 eating sandwiches is about $40. They give tons of sauce choices but too many choices is very confusing.
2015-09-20,4.0,"New York, NY",Irregardless Cafe & Catering,"It is a lovely place downtown raleigh. They grow their own herb and vegetable so the vegetable you get is clean and organic. There is an old guy playing music in the corner which is interesting. Now it comes down to the food. It is quite pricey, but it came in large portion, +free coffe+orange juice and it fullfilled my stomache so I am ok. I had the cape charles omelette, came with squared fries. The filling was a little too creamy and the seafood was not seasoned well for my taste. the fries was overcooked. It is not a super amazing but not too terrible either. It is one of those places that i just want to try once."
2015-09-20,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Big Al’s BBQ,"This place ROCKS!!! I've yet to have anything but a great meal here! Do yourself a favor and try the rib Meat sandwich! It's their delicious ribs off the bone on a freshly steamed bun! Plus they have a TON of sauces to choose from, I'm personally a fan of the red delicious apple bbq sauce! They just got a new Coke Freestyle machine to make almost any combination of Coke you can think of! Their shrimp corn chowder was great, has a nice little kick to it! So much better than any chain, I do my best to support local businesses and this one makes it super easy! Delicious frozen yogurt store next door topped off the night!"
2015-09-20,5.0,"Arlington, VA",Second Empire Restaurant And Tavern,I wanted to do 4.5 but am not used to the iPad.  This place is fancy!  And worth it if you're hungry and committed to being a bit more classy.  Rachel was a great server and was knowledgable but also funny.  The tables nearby were serious folks.  The breads ok but the butter is better.  The soup du jour was awesome.  Creamy cauliflower type soup with yummy toasted croutons.  The scallops were well cooked and nice but the dried bread pudding was a bit dense.  Wanted vegetables.  My partner loved the fish.  No room for dessert but the wine was sufficient.  If you're nearby give it a go.
2015-09-21,4.0,"Durham, NC",Sullivan’s Steakhouse,"Despite the menu prices, this is not a 5-star steakhouse. The wine list is seriously lacking, and the dress code for the waitresses and hostesses is ridiculous. Yes, all women have cellulite, but I do not want to stare at it while I'm eating. Dear management: please ask your female staff to wear clothes that are classy and that fit properly.I just can't take this place seriously. You can do better, Raleigh."
2015-09-21,3.0,"Durham, NC",Tarbouch,"I had high hopes for Tarbouch but wasn't too impressed after my recent Tuesday dinner time visit. The place was kind of empty and there were a few flies buzzing around inside. The guy behind the counter was not very welcoming, and the food was just OK. Maybe it's better at lunch time."
2015-09-21,2.0,"Westwood, Los Angeles, CA",Mura,"I would have given this place 4 stars, but I am torn between 3 and 3.5 stars. Reason being:Group of 12, one server for 90% of the whole restaurant (poor dude) but it took over 1 hour to get our entree... :(, that was a bit rough on us.Rolls are decent.Bento boxes are not bad.Sake bombs... well, don't expect to bang the table; just simply drop the sake into the beer cup.  Uni was not the best in my opinion, but they gave a huge portion of it."
2015-09-21,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Serena Sicilian Influenced Cucina,Their homemade Italian dressing is bursting with flavor I wish they would bottle and sell because I would buy it! Their minestrone soup is so flavorful. I would also recommend any of their pizzas!
2015-09-21,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Guasaca,"Are you SERIOUS? i haven't reviewed Guasaca yet? Probably because I'm always there eating and can't take a minute to write about it.This place is as good as quick serve gets folks. I don't like chains and I would propose to the owner of the Guasaca store tomorrow if I got arepas every night. Delish!What you need to know... It's cheap.It's super filling. One is enough for a woman, unless you ran a marathon earlier. It's fresh.It's fast.It's amazing.And it's gluten-free!I'm off the soap box now. Thank you allowing me to shamelessly promote my favorite haunt."
2015-09-21,4.0,"Kings Park, NY",The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar,"There aren't words. This place hit every savory craving I could've possibly had that night! Lobster, steak, hamburger, sushi, French fries, cold beers, fried pickles, oh my! Service was excellent! We shared a burger and our server brought out two plates with the burger cut in half and gave each of us our own serving of fried pickles. Yay! I was worried I'd have to fight for the pickles lol. Fun atmosphere too. It was very busy but the wait wasn't too bad, it seemed to go quickly. They take your name and give you a buzzer. They also have an app and you can do a call ahead. I'm still drooling over that meal."
2015-09-21,3.0,"Kings Park, NY",Another Broken Egg Cafe,"So, so is what I'll say. I was very happy with the free cinnamon roll thanks to the Yelp check in offer! Free is ALWAYS for me. It came out warm and oozing with icing and perfect for two people. That made me happy. While the menu items we ordered sounded amazing, they were pretty underwhelming to eat. Very mediocre, definitely like chain restaurant type food. Service was very friendly but slow. Our waitress disappeared for a while at one point and that was annoying. Cute coffee mugs, and casual atmosphere. 3 stars."
2015-09-21,3.0,"Chicago, IL",Sono,Good stuff! Sushi chef was very nice and fun to hang out with
2015-09-21,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mi Cancun,"Had a tasty molcajete here. My wife had the carne asada and enchiladas and found them quite good too. Liked the layout of the place too... clean, bright, modern, and spacious. A couple standards missing from the menu like chorizo con huevos, but what they did have was good."
2015-09-21,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Death & Taxes,"So apparently there are 2 other things in life, besides death and taxes, that you can count on.  Overpriced food and not being able to hear your conversation, all at Death & Taxes.  I have eaten at a ton of restaurants and this by far is the loudest restaurant I have ever been that is not a sports bar.  While the food was good (only reason for 3 stars), it was definitely not worth what was charged for it.  There were 4 of us and with a cocktail each, 2 glasses of wine each, 2 appys, sharing 3 entrees, 3 sides, and 2 desserts was over $400.  Insane!  Never again."
2015-09-22,4.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Tazza Kitchen Cameron Village,"Was unexpectedly and pleasantly surprised by this place! We were craving pizza and came here mildly sweaty in work out clothes. We were a little out of place, however sat outside and wasn't a big deal. Drinks---seemed pretty average. Got a couple glasses of wine. Didn't try any cocktails but the prices were average.  Ambiance/service---cute patio! Great service Food---delicious. We split the chorizo nachos and the sausage and honey pizza. Both awesome. The nacho chips were unique (I think maybe made with fried wontons?) and better than tortilla chips. The pizza was delicious...the sausage and honey combination was amazing. The thin crust was also perfectly baked. They say it's personal pizza size, but splitting an app and pizza was perfect for 2 of us and we left stuffed. Overall great food and a good place to catch up with friends. Would def frequent here if I lived closer, only wish they had a happy hour!"
2015-09-22,5.0,"Central City, KY",The Players Retreat,So I'm sitting at the bar and they are slow. I order a beer and the sausage dip. The dip is OK but could use a little more flavor.  The beer is as cold as it should be but not warn enough to not drink. I decide what I want and the bartender hasn't checked on me. She's looked right at me several times but is to busy talking to someone else to come check on her only customer.  Word to the wise when you work off tips don't ignore your customers. Guess I'll have to go eat somewhere else.
2015-09-22,5.0,"Jupiter, FL",Casa Carbone Ristorante Italiano,First time here.  Place is very tired.  Looks like it has seen better days.  Food was not very good but I also know that Italian food is in the eye of the beholder.  I would not return.
2015-09-22,5.0,"Tucson, AZ",Despina’s Cafe,"I found this place totally by mistake and at that time I realized I discovered a hidden gem, this place is so modern and cozy, we ordered chicken and roasted pork paninis, but I will definitely go back to try their baklava and bougatsa and other Greek goodies they serve, can't wait till next time. Would totally recommend this place to everyone!!!!!"
2015-09-22,5.0,"Waltham, MA",Serena Sicilian Influenced Cucina,Good food and generous portions! Staff was friendly and welcoming from the minute we walked in the door until we left. Will definitely be back!
2015-09-22,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Brookside Market & Deli,Tried this place takeout for the first time last night and got a large cheese pizza.  Super delicious and cheesy.
2015-09-22,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Capital Club 16,"Loved this place! We stopped by here close to midnight on a Saturday night for a snack and ordered the grilled cheese and added egg. It was AMAZING! Also, only $7. Our server was super nice and the place had a cool vibe and really cool décor. We'll be back!"
2015-09-22,4.0,"Cary, NC",Firebirds Wood Fired Grill,"This place never disappoints.  Of all the places we could eat at North Hills, we seem to end up here most of the time.Tonight we split a BLT salad and also split the bar bites Beef Sliders.  All the food was super fresh and tasty. The service was great since the bar wasn't crowded.  We were pleased We even ate our cake from Edible Art here (see that review too)."
2015-09-22,4.0,"Rockville, MD",Sawasdee Thai Restaurant & Bar,"Extremely good thai food with authentic flavors. I even came back the next day to try their ramen. The tonkatsu soup was very thick and done well! The braised pork was tender and cooked just right. If i'm ever in Raleigh again, i'm definitely hitting this spot again!"
2015-09-22,4.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Another Broken Egg Cafe,"Came here for brunch on a weekday. Service was fine. Location was cute. Menu pretty extensive. Pros: coffee was good, especially paired with a free cinnamon role with a check in! Food wise the huevos rancheros were delicious...The crispy tortilla on the bottom made it.We also subbed grits for home fries which were awesome (buttery and clogged up a few arteries) but delicious. Cons: the hey Lucy was not so tasty. Barely any chorizo nor avocado in the dish. Egg tasted over cooked. Would definitely not recommend. Overall slightly above average breakfast place (thanks to huevos rancheros). Would be back if I lived nearby, but don't think I'd make an extra trip out to Raleigh for it."
2015-09-22,4.0,"Waltham, MA",Lynnwood Grill & Brewing Concern,One of my favorite places! Awesome pizza and craft beer. There are always great specials and activities!
2015-09-22,4.0,"Durham, NC",Soo Café,"The restaurant itself is worn just like the shopping center it resides in. The décor of the place isn't very appealing either but I don't need a fancy place when I want to get elbow deep in some fried chicken. One server handled the 7 or so occupied tables on the Monday afternoon we dined and did a fantastic job. I ordered the Spicy Beef Bulgogi ($8.99) and my husband chose the Combo B- 2 drums and 8 wings in the SOGA (soysauce and garlic) sauce ($15). They had a TV in the corner playing K-Pop videos which my husband and I found oddly entertaining. Soon enough the Bulgogi arrived and we were pleasantly surprised by its spiciness. Definitely on the upper end of my spicy threshold and I will get this again when I return. Soon after we finished the chicken came out and it was lava hot. My tip would be to wait a few minutes for it to cool down. The pieces of chicken were huge and the photo doesn't do the portion size justice.  Everything everyone has said before me is true. The sauce was wonderful, the chicken extra crispy, and hands down some of the best chicken I have had to date. As others have mentioned they do not offer ban-chan but I think that helps keep the prices lower in general. They only have 4 sauces to choose from and you can only get one sauce per order of chicken. The menu is slightly limited compared to other Korean places but if you come for the main event you won't be disappointed. Soo Café is a no frills restaurant serving up some solid Korean food and if you haven't tried them yet you are missing out. Shout out to the Yelp community for bringing this little gem to my attention :)"
2015-09-22,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Lilly’s Pizza,"So this is the best pizza I have ever had. It may have just been the pizza we created with chicken, spinach, artichokes, and gouda - but it was definitely the best pizza I have ever had! The crust is very thin and slightly sweet, the chicken is incredibly tasty and you can tell everything else is fresh. BE WARNED though its hard to get through on the phone to put an order in on a busy night. We came last Saturday and were told there would be a 35 minute wait for our pizza and it ended up being over an hour - which is ridiculous! For this reason, and this reason only, is it only getting 4 stars."
2015-09-22,5.0,"Rochester, NY",Yard House,Really nice place.  A relatively extensive menu. I opted for a turkey burger and went with the truffle fries.  I was not disappointed.  There are several TVs and the number of draft beer is nearly uncountable.
2015-09-22,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Nashers Sandwich House,"Great sandwich and salad spot! Very clean, great outside seating, a good variety on their menu, very nice and helpful staff and most importantly - tasty food! Went here for lunch during the week and got the salad and sandwich combo and my husband got a sandwich with fries. Everything was great! Highly recommend it!"
2015-09-23,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Pearl Chinese Restaurant,"When trying out a new Chinese restaurant, I like to get my faves all at once and (hopefully if they're all tasty) I will eat them for the next few meals. Plus I'll know right away if a 2nd visit  in future  is even necessary. Sesame chicken with pork fried rice. Very good. No joke when I say this, the pork fried rice was best I've had in NC so far. Wonton soup, hot & sour soup, both very tasty. Egg roll was good & bigger than any I've seen in restaurants around here but not the most amazing tasting. Steamed veggie dumplings were very good. Overall I'm very happy with this new find. (Pearl Chinese restaurant). The employees are very warm & friendly and prices are on cheap side. And that is a turtle pond in the dining room of the restaurant."
2015-09-23,4.0,"Apex, NC",MoJoe’s Burger Joint,"Had a lunch date here a couple weeks ago. From the prices, it sounded like a pretty rockin' idea. Hers and mine both, with tip, banged out at a smooth $20. Can't beat the prices - unless you're getting ""what you pay for."" Like I did with my burger.I built my own burger. 1 single with tomato and grilled jalapeños. The patty was flat and totally rounded, like that cheapo thing they used to feed me in the high school cafeteria 100 years ago. It was an embarrassing mess that didn't deserve to be served to anybody. I figured that, since it was so cheap, that's how MoJoe's operated. Then, I got on Yelp and checked out the photos of all the delicious-looking burgers and wondered what the hell was going on with my order. Mine looked nothing like the ones in these pics and it tasted bland.The fries were good, as was the Arnold Palmer, which is my stock order when I go out. Service was friendly and justly kept my glass topped off with free refills. However, for two burger/fries orders, it still took an unusual 30 minutes to come to us - with a moderate 12:30pm crowd.As one other reviewer mentioned, the outside chairs aren't the most comfortable ever provided. I didn't hate them, but there are certainly better choices at Home Depot. And the parking can be dicey if you're not lucky. When they're filled up, that's just all she wrote.I'm still bamboozled by that burger. It really was like some lunch lady's pre-made patty."
2015-09-23,4.0,"Knightdale, NC",Clockwork,Stumbled upon this place quite by accident. Very chic and the food was great . I felt like I was in NYC with its great decor and open front. The service was polite but very inattentive . We were ignored for long stretches of time. Very nice when we did see them ...
2015-09-23,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Abyssinia Ethiopian Restaurant,"I LOVE this place. Although it is usually not full, Abyssinia is always delicious. Sometimes as a starter I get one of the sambusas. They are similar to empanadas, a fried dough outside with a yummy meat filling or lentils, both equally yummy. I always end up getting the 3 meat combination of Kay wat (beef), doro wat (chicken) and yebeg alicha (lamb). I get lentils as a side, which are smooth and spiced wonderfully. I love using my hands to eat this meal in the traditional way!! The meats are always hot and yummy, along with the injera that you eat it with is SO good, I always end up getting more!"
2015-09-23,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Cameron Bar and Grill,"What the hell I haven't been here in like two months and I was so excited toFinally come back but nope. completely lost my appetite.First glass had nasty dried food in it, second one some weird ass mucus idk what the hell looked like spit or snot. I honestly don't want to know. Won't be returning anytime soon, I live in Cameron village but it's not even worth the 2 minute walk. I can't believe this.It's sad because there's a new waiter who seemed sweet, but whatever. Service has always been slow here. I'll miss you, waffle fries."
2015-09-23,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",La Carreta Mexican Restaurant,"Came in to try this new restaurant that opened up in the Oberlin shopping center. We came in & were sat quickly. The interior is nice. While reading our menus, we were brought salsa and chips. The salsa was tasty and spicy. I was having a hard time deciding what to order. While I do feel bad for our waiter because he kept stopping at our table to see what I wanted, i do wish he offered guidance or asked if there were any questions I had... As opposed to coming and staring and then walking away. We finally placed our orders and it came out quickly. The guac wasnt very spicy but it was fresh! My boyfriend really loved his nachos. My coke (which their fountain coke is on point) was left unfilled. Another server came by to check on us and switched out a part of my order that had come out wrong. Later, no sign of our original server but another came by and offered to refill my boyfriend's drink. I never got my coke refill. We finally saw our server again when we got our check. My boyfriend made a comment to the manager when we paid because he is also a restaurant manager and he was irritated by the service. Our waiter came up while we were paying and asked the manager what happened in Spanish which rubbed me the wrong way because i dont think he realized we understood him (my boyfriend and I are both Spanish-speakers) but at least the manager was professional and responded we will talk later. Anyways good food but our particular server was crappy but the others were good so maybe we will come back and hopefully have a better experience."

2015-09-23,5.0,"Falls Church, VA",Irregardless Cafe & Catering,We needed GF and vegan options for our party of five. The food turned out to be excellent and service attentive. They set up a table outside for us and brought water for our two dogs. Overall great experience.

2015-09-23,5.0,"Holly Springs, NC",Oak City Meatball Shoppe,Great location downtown. Parking is easy on the street or nearby public garage. Great food and you better like meatballs. I got the spicy pork with Parmesan sauce and it was perfect. I think there were seven or eight different types of meat balls and the same number of sides to accompany it. Restaurant very clean and intimate. I can see that it would get very full as they seat less than 50 people. Nice bar area and a great selection of beer. Will definitely repeat.
2015-09-23,5.0,"Sunnyvale, CA",MachuPicchu Peruvian Cuisine,"Great restaurant, fantastic food, very authentic, and the nicest owners and staff.  Had a wonderful experience there."

My family and I visit at least once a week. My dads favorite: the veggie lasagna, madjarah (lentils and rice), and warm cabbage salad. (I can vouch they are all delicious...)Moms faves: chicken salad with some of the free pita (again, I can vouch, delishhhh)My current fave: Make your own sampler with 2 falafel (DELISH, dare I say best falafel ever), jalapeño cilantro hummus (REALLY? YES!), kale salad, and some super salad. So filling. So delicious. And I feel somewhat healthy eating it. Dessert -- I've tried the baklava, the gluten free peanut butter bar, and the gluten free pecan bar -- all delicious. Go here. You won't regret it."
2015-09-23,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mi Cancun,"This is a Mexican food lover's Mexican restaurant. I've eaten here many times and I've never been disappointed. The staff here even let me in for a beer and a bite to eat the other night when they were closed! ""Sit, eat, relax,"" they insisted. Stop by and tell Freddy the bartender to make you a carajillo. Try this restaurant; you'll be glad you did!"
2015-09-23,5.0,"Durham, NC",Aladdin’s Eatery,Never had a bad meal here. Their Lamb is solid. Great felafel and hummus. And their baklava is REALLY good. The only reason I didn't give Aladdin's 5 star would be the price. It's a little on the expensive side for quick Mediterranean.
2015-09-23,5.0,"Waterville, ME",Gino’s Pizza,By far the BEST pizza in the triangle! I have tried lots of pizza joints and I can say without a doubt that this is the best
2015-09-23,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sono,"I've eaten here once before, and thought is was meh, but Susan had not, and wanted to try it. Note, that we haven't had anything better than Waraji in the Raleigh area, but we needed to give Waraji a break.We sat at the sushi bar and opened with miso soup, edamame, a glass of wine and Sapporo, on draft. She got the VIP roll, and I got the Hamachi Jalapeno roll, and the nigiri's ordered were snapper, big eye, salmon, and scallop.Simply, the quality of food was okay, portions were a tad skimpy, and pricing was on the high side. Ambiance was cold and dark, but the service was really good. Also, we both thought that their rice was good.Nonetheless, good rice and service will not get us to come back to Sono."

Oh and the mimosas. 1 star for each item. My man friend got the BLT - nothing to write home about. I wanted the biscuits, but they were out by the time we got there (not that late in terms of brunch?) so I just ate some home fries. I wish I had just ate the broccoli and mimosas.The service -- I could tell they were trying but it was like everybody was confused? Wasn't well coordinated. Like I said, I will be back for the broccoli. But I hope next time I am more impressed bc this place has a lot of potential!"

Tip: If you want, you can order from the tavern menu even if you're sitting in the main restaurant! :-)"
2015-09-23,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Fu Kee Express,"I've only eaten here one time before and that was years ago. I remember being slightly turned off by the yellowish color of the fried rice but it wasn't bad, just different. I wanted to try for a second time. I attempted to call in the order and the line was busy. After trying a few times I decided to just go in and order. I get there and the guy never acknowledges me and the other customer already waiting because he's busy at it in the kitchen.  So after patiently waiting for 15 minutes he finally comes over and lets us know there will be a 40 minute wait and I was fine with that surprisingly. What turned me off was that he took the customer in front of me order and then turned and walked away without taking my order or even acknowledging me. So I guess he can can only take one order at a time. Anyway that was enough for me and I walked away. So today I figured let's try this again (3rd time's the charm right) maybe that day was a bad and busy day. I called and busy signal. I called again and the phone actually rings but no answer. I proceeded to call several more time and again no answer so I said what the heck and I went on over there. There's one person who's waiting for his food (An hour might I add and I overheard the dude telling him that, he was grinning from ear to ear I guess because somebody actually decided to wait so long but I'm assuming this guy was the one in a million that was able to get him on the phone and pre-order)so I was the only one at the register. Once again no acknowledgement and another 10-15 minute wait before he comes to the counter. I ordered a shrimp lo mein combo, oh but he doesn't do the shrimp lo mein in the combo so I ordered the chicken lo mein combo. I asked what veggies were in it and he says green onions and carrots. I asked if he could substitute regular white onions instead of the green onion and he says no, it will just be with carrots. Baffled I calmly collected myself and told him no thanks and left. He was just so rude and unaccommodating that I refused to spend my money there. I have never encountered a Chinese restaurant that would not let you substitute the veggies. Heck he could have a least said it would be an up charge. Here's my thing, I understand he's a ""one man show"" and it seems a lot of folks seem to have sympathy for him in that aspect but he is seriously compromising his customer service and professionalism. Okay you don't want anyone else cooking the food, at least get someone in there who can take the orders and collect payments. I bet you his attitude would be a lot more pleasant with just that little additional help. But I digress, I am unwilling to compromise on service and I hope his business continues to prosper but I hope he gets the service and attitude in check. Additionally this man didn't even wash his hands after handling payment and went back immediately to handling food, that's a no bueno for me. I will not be patronizing this business anymore and I will not recommend this spot to anyone and I mean no one. Oh I was able to find another spot who was more than accommodating (I was able to add any vegetables at no additional cost (yay to the water chestnut, baby corn and regular onions that was added) the food was good (I'm very picky) and they were very nice. Mr. Fukee, do yourself a favor and get yourself some help in there."
2015-09-24,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mami Nora’s,"Mami Nora's is the place to go when you want real ""home-cooked"" food without the hassle of cooking it yourself! Their specialty is rotisserie chicken cooked by charcoal grilling which produces a moist and flavorful inside and perfectly browned outside! I don't eat a lot of meat/poultry but I LOVE their chicken. I always order mine with a side of black beans and white rice and an order of maduros (fried sweet plantains). I mix my rice and beans together and drizzle some of their spicy green sauce on top. DELICIOSO!I've visited this location many times for lunch and dinner and the food is consistently great. The line is long at lunch time but it always moves fast. Seating is a mix of tables and booths. Nothing fancy but it doesn't try to be fancy, just yummy good food every single time!"

2015-09-24,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",BURGERFI,"Burgerfi is a casual, family friendly restaurant for anyone nearby to easily go to grab a quick bite to eat with friends or family. They have a variety of menu items to choose from such as burgers (even veggie burgers), fries (with different toppings like 'Parmesan + Herb' and/or Garlic Aioli, chili, cheese, etc), and even custards/milkshakes for dessert. For my choice of menu, I got the 'the twenty eight burger'. It's a ""DOUBLE 28-DAY DRY-AGED GROUND BRISKET BURGER, SWISS + BLUE CHEESE, LETTUCE, TOMATO, PICKLES, BURGERFI SAUCE"". In other words, a really delicious burger!!! I've recently started to fall in love with burgers and fries. I don't know what triggered this obsession for a perfect burger and crispy fries combination, but I love burgers-- well most burgers. I'm not quite sold for the veggie burger scene yet, just because I have yet to have found a really good veggie burger... Anyhow, this burger was very tasty and the Parmesan+Herb+Garlic Aioli fries I had with it just made my day. Seriously. I love fries, and I love it more with cheese and garlic! I love the portion sizes here, well as far as the Burger and fries portions. My burger was a good sized burger, good sized as in two meat patties and lots of toppings inside! I got the regular size for the fries, but looked like a large! It took 3 people to work on it, and we still couldn't finish it because we were so full from our burgers! They also sell bottled beers and local draft, which makes me love this place more. I'm not much of a drinker, but I do love myself a cold beer with burgers. Definitely a place to check out! I will be back! I will."
2015-09-24,4.0,"New Bern, NC",Black Cat Cafe,I ordered a gluten free beer and then asked about the salmon dinner entree.   She said it could be made gluten free and even checked with the kitchen.   Service was slow.  We got our food and my plate had bread on it flanking my salmon. No mention that the bread was gluten free so had to assume it wasn't.   Would have sent it back but didn't have the time since they were so incredibly slow.  We had to get up and beg just to pay the check.  Staff and manager didn't seem concerned at all that I was worried my meal might not be safe or even prepared as ordered.   I'm only sensitive not allergic but I didn't feel well after the meal.   I won't be back.

Ordered off the dinner menu Chicken Parm with salad and garlic knots! Salad was fresh and plate chilled, garlic knots were awesome but the chicken Parm was the star of the show! Pasta was perfectly Al dente and sauce was  not overly sweet. The chicken was lightly breaded and cooked to perfection! I have lived in NC for most 9 years and this is the best Italian I have ever had. Waitress had many tables but knew how to handle everyone with ease! This is now my new go to Italian place. You MUST try!"

2015-09-24,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Lilly’s Pizza,"I'd give the pizza 4 stars out of 5 but the service is so incredibly abysmal I can't rate this place any higher than 2/5. I wouldn't be surprised if they poached the staff from a KFC/Taco Bell. Lily's has always been slow but its gotten even worse lately. Kind of like my experience with WalMart: every time I go in there, I swear to myself it is the last time I do. Expect about 75% accuracy with your order. Last time I was there I saw someone at the counter tell a food runner to send back the pizza to the customer even after the runner said that the order was wrong."

Nope. But I wanted to try it ... AMAZING! sweet/sour/savory. yes)- Mixed Greens sunflower seeds, goat cheese, cranberries, honey champagne vinaigrette $7 (I'm usually not one for sweet stuff on my salad but this was awesome!)The kid had:Bacon Jam Burger smoked maple cheddar, fried onions, lettuce $13 (they grind their own beef so we ordered it medium rare for her - really good - the sweet of the jam mixed with the fried onions and bacon and well, everything was pretty dang good! the fries are shoestring & awesome)"
2015-09-24,2.0,"Mendham Township, NJ",Fu Kee Express,"Typically I order General Tso's Chicken, Sesame Chicken, or General Tao's Chicken--all of which are breaded. The dilemma is that so many Chinese places use SO much batter so your pieces of 'chicken' are really like 70% dough and you feel cheated. I was delighted to see that Fu Kee Express does NOT do this. The breading is so light it's perfect, you get big MEATY chunks of chicken. It is so delicious. HIGHLY recommend. I've never had better Chinese food. Note: It seems Fu Kee is a one man operation--absolute props to him for choosing to serve high quality food. He said the chicken is fresh everyday--after eating it I 100% believe it, his Chinese food doesn't even compare to others. Fu Kee is in a class of its' own."

Carnivore's dream; limited fare for vegetarians but go anyway for the oyster mushrooms. My carnivore friends recommend the raw oysters and pig's head; I really thought they were going to transcend based on how much they enjoyed the food. Casual and hip ambiance; we hung out until closing because the vibe was so good. Seems to be in the middle-of-nowhere so just follow the GPS.
2015-09-24,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Big Ed’s City Market Restaurant,"Visited on a weekday during lunch hours because I wanted a good southern style breakfast sandwich made with a biscuit. I have to say, I was slightly disappointed. The biscuit was dense and thick instead of light and fluffy BUT the bacon was crispy and it had a thick slice of melted cheddar so overall it was VERY GOOD despite the sub par biscuit. I think maybe I had one from an old batch that had already cooled down so I would try them again to find out. All of the food is southern-style and the servers are too. They are friendly and COUNTRY. There is nothing fancy about this place so come as you are. They have an assortment of breakfast meats as well as HUGE pancakes that would easily feed three people. The dining room is big and open with plenty of tables but I've heard there is always a wait on the weekends. I would definitely try this place again based on the friendly service!"

2015-09-25,5.0,"Coral Gables, FL",Bolt Bistro,"I really believe this restaurant is so underrated, it may be my favorite restaurant in raleigh! I've been back to Bolt twice since my last review and I must say its just as good as when I first went, if not better! The second time I went, I sat outside for happy hour with my boyfriend. Getting a table was easy even though they were busy, the hostess was very sweet. The drinks are cool and seasonal, the service was great despite how busy they were. Although we only ordered drinks and some small bites (all delicious), the waiter did not make us feel as if he was eager for us to get up so he can get another table of people to order, we felt as if we could relax and enjoy ourselves. We had their seafood platter special and scallop sliders- delicious and so unique! Very reasonably priced food and drinks for happy hour (check their site- I believe it's $7-8 for apps and drinks vary). The third time I've been was last night for dinner with a group. I was shocked that it was dead but I believe it was due to Raleigh Beer Week and the rain. Regardless, all staff were very attentive. Our waiter did an exceptional job explaining the specials, his favorite items, and flavors. We had the oysters (blue point-amazing and fresh), calamari (they add fried pineapple, very nice touch) and shrimp cocktail for the table. Their French onion soup is great and is served is a large onion which is very cool. They had many great specials and I had the butternut squash ravioli topped with shrimp - I HIGHLY recommend this dish and Bolt overall."

They also catered to different diets which is helpful for people with restrictions (ie: vegetarian, gluten free). We were able to make reservation which was nice because we did not have to wait for a table. They started out by bringing us biscuits and a blueberry jam. They were both delicious! The blueberry jam was fresh and not super sweet which was perfect! My food was cooked perfectly and the maple bacon was so yummy. It was crispy and had a little hint of sweetness to balance the salty bacon. Everyone else enjoyed their food as well. Our server was super nice and made sure we had everything we needed.

2015-09-26,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tasty 8’s,"There's a lack of late-night food options in downtown Raleigh. Tasty 8's is definitely filling a need, but they always let me down somehow.On my last visit to their sidewalk window, they didn't seem to remotely care about my order. Not surprisingly, they didn't get it right. They have gourmet prices with a fast food attitude. Maybe some employees have been tainted by bros wandering by from Coglins or The Architect.The full size hot dogs are very large, and are a decent alternative to the ""street meat"" from the hot dog carts. At 2am, the dogs will definitely help balance out the alcohol. They're pretty tasty and I'm a fan of The National (pimento/okra/chow chow) and El Perro (Mexican dog). They've changed up the menu a bit since they've opened, testing new dogs as specials. They introduced a ""puppy dog"", which is about the size any normal person should ever need.I think the shakes are the best, and most consistent, part of Tasty 8's; they are only rivaled in quality by Chuck's. The entire shakes menu is fantastic, but I'll never order the strawberry shortcake (ugh). Momma Wells' Tasty Treat and the Salty Dog are safe bets.I'm sure I'll stop by Tasty 8's again soon and it'll probably a snap decision at 2am. They get a benefit-of-the-doubt three stars, because I expect that their service experience will evolve like the menu. Good luck to them."

2015-09-27,4.0,"Warminster, PA",Sullivan’s Steakhouse,"The three hour meal was well-timed and enjoyable; although some of the dishes weren't for me personally. Four stars for service and steak, but it missed out on a few items that could have been great. Last night was my first time at Sullivan's, and it was with a private party of about 20-25 people. I had been to Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse as well as the Grille in Boston, so I had high expectations, but I was prepared to cut Sullivan's some slack given how large our party was. As it turned out, no slack necessary. The service was incredible. They had our first rounds of wine out in a very timely fashion and continued to fill our glasses and water without remiss all night. My friend and I split a $32 Savignon Blanc (cheapest on the menu), which they kept chilled nearby, and it lasted us most of the dinner. I know white wine with steak is a cardinal sin, but I almost never drink reds. I indulged in the Prix fixe menu ($42 for app, soup/salad and entree). For my appetizer I had the cheesesteak spring rolls. I've had this same dish off of the Del Frisco's menu and loved them, so I was hoping they used the same recipe, but no such luck. These cheesesteak spring rolls err more on the side of spring roll than cheesesteak, dressed with a tangy orange sauce and only a light hint of cheese. They were certainly gourmet, but not what I would hope for in this particular app. I was, however, pleasantly surprised at the portion - four decently sized spires - given that I ordered Prix fixe. For my next course I had the shrimp and lobster bisque. It was flavorful and light, just how I like it. I would have enjoyed a little more lobster meat or pieces of shrimp in it, but the heavily puréed soup was still very good. For my entree I had the 6 oz filet cooked to a perfect medium rare and asparagus as a side. Both were so delicious and well-cooked that I actually opted out of any additional sauces (which for a sauce hound like me is a big deal). Around the table I also had a chance to try the fried calamari. It was tasty in my opinion, but it definitely had a strong kick of jalapeño. The garlic mashed potatoes were creamy, but not overpowering. The brussel sprouts weren't the best I've had - served in pieces almost shredded as opposed to whole or even half sprouts, over-seasoned with ground black pepper and dressed in a very potent sauce that tasted like a vinegar of some sort. To be fair, they usually come with bacon, which my friend opted out of, so that could have made all the difference. At the end of the meal, the checks took a while to sort out, but after having such outstanding service all night I hardly noticed. Half a bottle of wine, app, salad and entree plus tip cost $80."
2015-09-27,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",El Tapatio Mexican Restaurant,"This review is based off a filete (tilapia) served w rice and pico and customary side of iceberg. I also ordered a frozen margarita (served bien fria w salt). Chips and salsa came upon sitting, the salsa was average. Tilapia was large serving and well seasoned (a bit too much) and pan fried to tasty perfection. Rice was good, pico was about 1/2 of what I'd expect. A few slices of avocado. Margarita was great for price. Service was fine, I was one of the few customers on a lazy Sunday."

The ramen here was delicious and quite filling.There are options for those of us who don't eat meat. The noodles were soft but firm, which is important.  If you are looking g for a great place to get ramen, this is it. The restaurant was very clean and rather intimate.  This is really not a place to take children."
2015-09-27,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Randy’s Pizza,"The pizza was undercooked. The sausage is shaped like rabbit scat and tastes really bad.   It could have been a bad night for them. Even though it's close, I will not be returning."
2015-09-27,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tarbouch,"This is a place your order at the counter, then sit down kind of place.  Good Mediterranean food at a reasonable price.The CURRY CHICKEN PLATTER (chicken in creamy curry sauce with spices over lentil & basmati rice) is very good, as is the LAMB & BEEF GYRO (lamb & beef with Greek seasoning, lettuce, onion, tomato, & tzatziki sauce).Decent food at a reasonable price."
2015-09-27,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Brio Tuscan Grille,"So I'm typically not a fan of chain restaurants, but this place is great.  I love the sourdough bread that taste like it's direct from San Francisco.The Brio Chopped Salad, has gotten a bit smaller over our last few visits, but still a great salad.I love the PASTA PESTO: angel hair, grilled chicken, caramelized onions, spinach, tomatoes, red peppers, Feta, basil, light pesto sauce.  It's a lite item menu item with big taste.  Awesome!"
2015-09-27,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Ni Asian Kitchen,Their online ordering system works very well. We had 2 entrees: Basil chicken & beef w/broccoli. Both were very salty. Reasonably priced at $8.95 but we won't return.
2015-09-27,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Margaux’s Restaurant,"Went on a Saturday night for a special occasion. Being a special occasion, we decided to allow ourselves some meat (seafood and even a soup with some beef broth in it). We called ahead and they put us on the list, so we were seated as soon as we walked in.The excellent service started with our wine choices. We were unsure about a few whites, so the server offered to give us a splash of each so we could taste and decide. She didn't have to do that, so it was a nice unexpected gesture. We chose an Australian sauvignon blanc with a nice buttery finish and a pinot blanc from California with a bright grapefruit and passion fruit nose.Fried clams and oysters appetizer: Great! Maybe the breading was a just bit too thick and crusty, but overall it was delicious. Our only ""complaint"" about it is that it's a lot of fried food... If I went again, I'd split this app among 4 people instead of between 2.Nachos with crab meat appetizer: Really great, rich nachos. The guacamole was excellent, and the little pieces of sweet crab meat were a wonderful addition to a classic dish.French onion soup: Extremely rich broth. The best FOS I've had besides that one bowl near the Eiffel Tower. :-) The thick layer of melted cheese and soaked slice of bread made this a hearty, filling bowl.After all these adjectives - ""thick, rich, hearty"" - we were too full to even start on our main and instead asked them to just box it for us to-go. We're about to go eat our seafood plate with white bean stew for leftover brunch!One of the most pleasant surprises for Margaux's was the portion size! The dollar prices on the menu are a little higher than we typically seek out, but good value for the quality AND quantity. For example, we were expecting the crab meat nachos to be like nachos ""deconstructed,"" with six individual chips, each dressed with a smear of cheese sauce, bejeweled with a lump of crab, and adorned with three tomato pieces, two diced tomato pieces, and a dollop of guacamole. But it was actually a plate of nachos! Delicious, rich, ""fancy"" nachos, and not an intimidating mountain of nachos, but just a nice full plate.Because the entrees are so meat-focused, we're thinking we'll come back here for some veg / seafood appetizers and a glass of wine when we're wanting a nice treat for a fancy happy hour.Oh, and the décor is nice. Elegant with a nice bit of funkiness."
2015-09-27,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gringo A Go-Go,"We were excited to try Gringo but were not impressed.Pros - The guacamole was good and the server was very nice.Cons - I ordered enchiladas, server recommended, and everything on the plate was bland.  I felt like I was eating at a hospital restaurant where nothing has salt.  The chicken inside the enchiladas had no seasoning.  My husband ordered al pastor and carne asada tacos.  The steak was chewy and had lots of fat.  The al pastor meat was more tender but the seasoning tasted like hot dog chili...weird.  We did not finish our plates (small) and left hungry.  Sadly, we will not return."

I was not disappointed. Live music, coffee/tea included in the price of your meal, a delightful southern menu and a lovely little quirky atmosphere. I suppose they owed that to us, the diners, for coming up with the most obnoxious name for a restaurant that ever was (anyone else think of the Family Guy episode with Stewie's Law?)My shrimp & grits were perfectly creamy and cheesy with a delightful amount of crunch from some scallions, and every single other plate at my table looked delightful. I almost forgot to mention the complimentary slab of 3 or 4 different types of bread. Pretty sure there was pumpkin, lemon poppy seed, and then a couple of savory options. All delicious. I'll avoid some punny comment about how you should make it a point to visit this place irregardless of how full your schedule is......ok maybe I won't."

Great atmosphere! okay service..We came for brunch and my fiance got the spicy sausage and black pepper honey pizza, which was very very good--sort of sweet with a spicy kick. I got the huevos rancheros which was pretty good, but not something i'd come back for. The decor is great, and you can tell it's a hip spot as a lot of college students/young professionals seem to eat here.One thing I wasn't a fan of was the service. I understand brunch is a busy time for the restaurant, but we hardly saw the server, and it was a LONG time waiting for our food to come out."

2015-09-28,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Nashers Sandwich House,"seeing the high reviews for nashers, I was curious and dragged my boyfriend all the way to north raleigh and WOW it was so worth it.We got there right before it was closing (listed as 8pm every night, but they stayed open later since people kept coming in) and what i had planned on ordering, the pot roast grilled cheese, was all gone. So instead I got the ""TK BLT grilled cheese"" since i was really itching for some grilled cheese. So on paper, this is a grilled cheese with some turkey. and i dont know what i was thinking, assuming it'd be turkey of the sliced variety. because, no. it's like they carved a thanksgiving turkey and put it in your sandwich. HUGE, generous portion of turkey meat. And I know what you're thinking---""wait, then was it DRY??"" and my answer to you is NO! I dont know how they did it but this turkey was SUPER moist and flavorful. Daresay, this turkey is the best turkey i've ever tasted (yes, better than thanksgiving dinner turkey). The second best thing about this sandwich? They put this ""nasher sauce"" on it, which is like they're house sauce and it is SOOO GOOD. Sort of like a tangy chipotle aioli or something, i was hooked. I'll have to come back here to get the fries because those come with nasher sauce on the side...My boyfriend got the nashers fried chicken which he said was super delicious and it is GIGANTIC. Only thing he mentioned as a critique was that the bacon in it was sort of overshadowed so you don't really taste it. We shared the creamy corn bisque which was very yummy as well. They add a little crabmeat to the top of the bisque which was a nice touch.I'm definitely going to come back soon--got to get more of that nasher sauce!"

The lighting is perfect with a beautifully lit bar. The seating is comfortable and there are gorgeous wooden trusses on the ceiling. We started out with the lobster queso because I mean, how can you go wrong with that? (You can't) I had the wood grilled salmon which was perfection and my main squeeze had the blue cheese filet mignon which was wrapped in bacon. He thought the blue cheese sauce was amazing but the bacon seemed to be a bit off. We couldn't manage dessert but I hear the Big Daddy's Chocolate Cake will blow your socks off.

The food is pretty good, and the service has been just above average.Unfortunately, this past Sat (9/26), service was freakin' horrendous. You really have to screw the pooch for me to say something like that. While I haven't been impressed by their service, there was nothing about it that detracted from overall past dining experiences. This night, it took 20mins for me to get a glass of wine, and we were constantly ignored by our primary server. Note, another server brought my wine over (only after we got her attention) because our primary server was always on the other side of the room.Nonetheless, I'm giving 4 stars because, normally, service is decent, and the food has always been good.I'm hoping our next experience includes much better service ..."

Quality of everything always seems to be fresh and yummy.Tried out some of the pita/sandwiches and those were not very good, but will have to give those another try another time. It does get busy around here I've noticed at times, with long lines and a bit of chaos all-around, so quality on the actual prepped foods may be hit or miss depending the time of day you are there."

2015-09-29,5.0,"Henrico, VA",Oakwood Café,"Wowza! This place is busy but worth the wait. If you are a single you will have to wait, the bigger tables will get all of the attention but the food is worth the wait. STAY, good food is always worth the wait. First, the Cuban coffee is stellar! The French Onion soup is familiar yet unique, it's the best I've ever had. I chose the Cuban sandwich and fried yucca. The roasted pork is so tender it melts in your mouth. The Yucca is a special surprise. The house made hot sauce is ""award-winning"" worthy. I saved half of the sandwich to indulge in dessert.  Tres leches cake is incredible. The family is lovely and the owner is just so nice. If I'm ever back in Raleigh, I will definitely go again."

We got the pimento cheese sliders for a app - which were fantastic, you could tell the tomatoes on them were so fresh! I had a hard time deciding between a couple things - I love their variety of options! I ended up getting the chicken caprese sandwich with a side of the zucchini sticks - both of which were fantastic and my husband got the steak and cheese sub with broccoli rabe, which he raved about! We splurged for the bourbon bread pudding dessert - which was definitely worth it! The staff was very nice, knowledgeable, and attentive and the price for the quality cannot be beaten! We will definitely be back!"

Making it my problem that you are short on drivers was your first mistake. Compounding that error over $2 was your second. Having your manager fail at trying to be condescending to me was #3.

2015-09-29,5.0,"Fremont, CA",PDQ,"A great quality of food, along with great customer service. Those two things are very hard to find together in a restaurant, let alone fast food. They also have the cool soda machine where you can get any drink and flavoring.

What a great company, I wish there were more of these around the Raleigh area although I will drive out of my way to eat here!"
2015-09-29,1.0,"Clayton, NC",Another Broken Egg Cafe,"First let me admit that I am very particular about my breakfast. While it is my favorite meal of the day, it's hard to beat my own cooking. I've been here a number of times and each time I order something different. Today I had the Bacquezo for the first time. Cream cheese and bacon filled with chorizo, monterey jack cheese and green onions. I had it with a side of grits and  biscuit. Okay, so the omelet was slightly dry. You have to be careful with an omelet that has so much meat even when you are doing a cream cheese. It also lacked seasoning even though it had all of those strong flavored meats. The grits had too many lumps in it but I ate around it. The biscuit had the look of homemade but it too lacked taste. The service was good, the place was clean and it came hot. The other good thing, when I checked in here through YELP, I got a free cinnamon roll that was the tastiest of all. I would come again and try something else yet again."
2015-09-29,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sawasdee Thai Restaurant & Bar,"I've dined in once and gotten take out on two occasions. The only negative I've experienced is not receiving enough rice on a take out order. Other than that- I am a fan! The staff are courteous, food is prepared in a timely manner, portions are more than satisfactory, and food flavors are delicious. They make very satisfying currys and noodle dishes. The ingredients seem top notch. FYI- When they say spicy- they mean spicy! I got a medium spice on the evil jungle noodles and had to break out the milk to mollify my mouth. A medium of a green curry dish wasn't quite as spicy (but still spicy). It's good stuff and fairly priced. Sawasdee is my go-to Thai restaurant in this area! Very satisfying!"

2015-09-29,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sono,"I'm not sure it's fair for me to write this review since I haven't even tried their sushi! But I can speak for the other items on the menu, which were all impeccable. The first time we came was during triangle restaurant week, so i got to try a great sampling of what sono has to offer. Some of these were special items that aren't on the regular menu :(1. ikura don: basically a small chirashi bowl with delicious tuna, wasabi octopus (i would not typically eat octopus but the wasabi flavor was amazing) and some roe over perfectly cooked sushi rice. 2. scallop credo: a beautifully presented dish of scallops, very very lightly seared. So has the texture of raw scallop. YUM3. the tonkatsu and spicy miso ramen: boyfriend and I both agreed the tonkatsu ramen was better. Spicy miso was sort of one-note in that the spice was all you tasted. Not as much depth.4. Pork belly buns were amazing. Reminds me of the famed ones in nyc...Now, we come back often for that tonkatsu ramen which thankfully they have regularly. Again, I'll have to try the sushi and update my review. :)"

Got the pasta primavera which comes with a side salad. Also got a hot tea on this chilly & rainy day. It was all perfect and actually too much food.

The kitsch on the walls, the friendly Southern servers, the delicious food -- even Big Ed's chair with the nameplate on the back -- all still there. Big Ed's is an institution, nestled in City Market, a cozy respite from the rain. We ordered steaming coffee, a Western omelet, grits with redeye gravy, country ham and biscuits. The biscuits are the best in the world: hot and fluffy with crunchy, buttery edges. Forget brunch. Forget fancy benedicts and mimosas and hoity-toity fussy tableclothy walk-of-shame-awkward meals in your preppy best. You want breakfast. At Big Ed's. It'll be the best thing you do with your weekend."
2015-09-29,4.0,"Washington, DC",Glenwood Grill,"I've now visited Glenwood Grill twice with co-workers while we were visiting from DC on a work trip. The first visit was for take-out at lunch and a true 3-star... I ordered the salmon salad and another one of my co-workers ordered the crab cake and I felt like the portions were so small... while the salad was tasty it wasn't that satisfying. We then visited the following week and I ordered the acorn squash bisque and the thai chicken salad. The chicken salad was a much larger portion and coupled with the soup, I was very full and satisfied after. My boss had their version of a salmon ceasar salad and absolutely loved it. I saw a couple other tables with individuals who order the chicken salad (i.e. mayo-based that would normally be on a sandwich) over fruit and it looked very good as well as their tacos. Glenwood now has a 3.5-stars and we'll likely revisit for another lunch trip or maybe dinner and bump that review up to a 4-star!"
2015-09-29,5.0,"Durham, NC",Second Empire Restaurant And Tavern,"Second Empire gets a lot of hype in the Triangle, but after visiting them for the first time this past week, I was disappointed that the food didn't deliver more. We chose to dine in the ""Tavern"" section of the restaurant (FYI: this old, historic house is split up into two sections: the upstairs dining room and the Tavern. The Tavern is more casual but still offers you the option of ordering off Second Empire's menu, whereas the upstairs dining room is very formal but limits you to their select menu). We made a reservation and we seated prompted, note, there's a ""side"" entrance for The Tavern, if you're standing at of the gate, simply go around to the left and down the side stairs, you can't miss it. I will say, the atmosphere (other than being nosy) and service were absolutely stellar. Our waiter knew the menu inside and out and was very hospitable. I think the hype of Second Empire might skew people's opinions, don't get my wrong, the food was good, but for try fine dining and the prices you're paying, I thought the meal was disappointing [please read my meal breakdown below]. I was thinking to myself after the meal, ""I'd love to go back"" but the reason wasn't because I was amazed at the food, it was because I wanted to rectify the mistakes and have something different--something better. Citrus grilled colossal shrimp to start. It was definitely the stand out item! Amazing mix of flavors, they split the appetizer for two and we each received one giant shrimp atop grits and a green tomato ($14).Citrus & herb grilled swordfish {creamy herb & ricotta cheese polenta, tapenade, garlicky spinach, roasted asparagus, ratatouille, saffron & tomato fumet $25}: What stood out in this dish was the polenta. The swordfish was unfortunately overcooked, creating a chewy and dry consistency. Lack of salt and citrus left the dish undesirable after a couple bites. Swordfish is an amazing fish, but this dish missed the mark.Rosemary & Garlic Braised Mississippi Rabbit {rigatoni pasta, roasted zucchini, cherry tomatoes, fava beans, spinach, rutabaga, baby carrots, roasted garlic cream sauce $23}: If you're looking for an incredibly CREAMY garlic sauce, this is it. They sauce stole the show, so much so that it cloaked everything else with it's flavor. the rabbit was very overpowered by the cream sauce and the ratio of garlic to rosemary was completely off, leaving no rosemary flavoring at all. Pasta and vegetables were overcooked, so the texture of the dish didn't add up. And it's never a good thing when you bite into a piece of rabbit and find a bone. Overall, the food okay, service was stellar and the atmosphere was enjoyable. But having high expectations walking in and expecting an incredible meal, my tastebuds were highly disappointed."

They offer a kids menu with crayons that includes a beverage $5.49. My daughter enjoys coming here! Sign up for their free frequent diner club and get even more savings when you come."
2015-09-29,5.0,"Morrisville, NC",Bella Monica,Heard about this place from a friend. I'm surprised with its mixed reviews here in Yelp. Tried this restaurant yesterday for lunch and overall we had a good experience. Started with their house salad which was very fresh. I had their special Linguine ai Frutti di Mare which was very tasty with its seafood. My husband is just easy and had meat lasagna which was very delicious(just like  real homemade meat lasagna). Had affogato & chocolate amore(flourless cake) for desserts. My husband had a surprise birthday cannoli treat too! Thanks to our server. Service was good. Try Bella Monica for good Italian cooking like your Nana's.
2015-09-30,5.0,"Hickory, NC",Monapita Mediterranean Grill,OMG! This place is Great!  I got a chicken gyro and hummus with pita and they were the freshest most savory Mediterranean cuisine I've ever had. It appears to be a family operation with multiple generations represented.  My lunch with a large drink came to $11.50. I highly recommend!I've never commented on Yelp before but felt I had to on this little gem. Look for them on Capital Ave in the Best Buy shopping center.
2015-09-30,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chow Pizza Bar,"After a long break from Chow, I decided to give it another shot and grab a burger for takeout, with lackluster results.  My hamburger, while packaged neatly and securely in the takeout bag, somehow appeared as if someone had set it on the dashboard of a car and driven it off a cliff.  In the end, it was just an indistinguishable pile of mushy food matter.  Is that a fried green tomato?  Is that cheese?  Wait, is that the patty?  I'm not even sure.  Picture trying to eat some casserole or lasagna with your bare hands.  When I was finished I almost needed to take a shower considering the messy burger crime scene that was now all over the place.  One of the sloppiest and messiest blobs of goop I can ever recall eating, especially for a burger.  As for the taste, it tasted like a goopy pile of blob.But hey, the onion rings were pretty good, so that's nice."
2015-09-30,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sosta Café,The owner is French and always has the cutest little cast of people attending to the shop.  My favorite being an older gentlemen and trying to marry me every time I visit.  The food is fresh and light but flavorful and different.
2015-09-30,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Saltwater Seafood & Fry Shack,"I can't believe I've driven by Saltwater Seafood & Fry Shack maybe a thousand times and have never stopped. This review is for the fry shack, though if the crowd is any indication, the seafood side is really popular.I can't remember the last time I had seafood that was fried; I enjoy it too much to be disappointed by greasy and bland dishes. But, given the reviews and a craving for oysters, I had to try this spot. I ordered the shrimp & oyster combo plate ($10.99) and had my choice of popcorn shrimp or six large shrimp. I opted for the popcorn shrimp and the plate came with five oysters and a pile of shrimp. Both were fried to perfection and the batter was flavorful. But oddly, no lemon wedges. The plates come with your choice of two sides- choices include green beans, French fries,  boiled potatoes, fried okra, potato salad and cole slaw.  I opted for potato salad and cole slaw. The potato salad had a pickle and dill flavor and was delicious, but the real star was the cole slaw. Served ice cold, it was barely dressed - actually I don't think there was any mayo, but really fresh and crisp and perfect with the fried seafood.  As if all that isn't enough, every plate comes with a side of hush puppies, which puts the whole thing over the top.Lots of folks call their order in ahead, which is smart considering how popular they are.  This spot is take-out only, though there is one lone table on the side of the building.  Since fried seafood should be eaten right away, it does take some planning. On this particular sunny Saturday there were several people sitting in camping chairs, eating in the shade.Overall, service was friendly and quick and the space is clean. In addition to the fry shack, there is a fish counter and small grocery with items needed to cook seafood, like Old Bay, corn meal and tartar sauce. I can't wait to go back, and this time I'll bring lemon wedges."

2015-09-30,5.0,"Roanoke, VA",Humble Pie,"I just realized the other day that this is the place I've taken every guest that I've had visit me in Raleigh. There's a good reason; Humble Pie puts out fantastic quality food with amazing consistency. The plates here are for sharing. With a party of four I've generally found that ordering 4-5 plates makes for a good meal for everyone. I've ordered as many as 8, but we kind of went overboard that night...I regret nothing. The dishes are unique and creative. I never would have thought I would order avocado and peas on toast in a restaurant, but weird dishes like this have turned into some of my favorites here. I've been for brunch once, it was great as well."
2015-09-30,5.0,"Chantilly, VA",Sono,"I would like to say that they did get us into the restaurant during Animazement and Memorial Weekend this year.  There was only 4 of us this year.  Everyone at my table ordered Sushi except for me.  I ordered Japanese Ramen.  The sushi was delicious and definitely the best I've tasted for Raleigh.  As for the Ramen, I think Sono just does not like me.  I ordered the ramen and I asked them to put the spices on the side.  They must have dumped a cup of hot spices into my soup because it was not edible.  I asked the waiter to take it back to the kitchen and he refused.  So while the sushi was delicious, we will not be returning next year, memorial day weekend to have any food at Sono.  I think we will go to a different restaurant where they don't dump a cup of hot chili powder into your ramen soup.  As a result, of the ramen noodle soup, Sono only gets upgraded to a 3 star."
2015-09-30,3.0,"Durham, NC",Sono,"I'm a big fan of nigiri! I was little bit disappointed of there's no good nigiri place around triangle until I try sono. Sono totally worth a 5 star review of their nigiri omakase set! Fish quality is good, especially the uni is from Japan which make the whole set totally worth your $45! Very recommended! Will come back again for other food soon!"

2015-09-30,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Big Ed’s City Market Restaurant,"I love southern comfort food and breakfast, so what better way to spend a Saturday morning than to check out Big Ed's City Market? I actually hadn't heard of Big Ed's till my friends suggested it and told me its ""real southern"". Apparently what warranted Big Ed's as ""real"" southern (as opposed to fake southern??) was all that they had to offer, the decor and super friendly service. And yes, I think I'd call it southern after my dining experience. I ordered one hot cake with the Carolina Packers smoked sausage and added an egg because why not round out the meal? Well, I'm very glad I didn't order more than one hot cake because it was HUGE! Like bigger than my face huge! I couldn't even finish the one hot cake I ordered with the help of my two friends... yeah. It was that big. But I enjoyed the hot cake, it was fluffy and light but not super thin which I liked. The smoked sausage and egg was good as well. I like the snap of the smoked sausage which can be hard to do if you don't cook it properly.  The service was good, our server was friendly and attentive and the prices were reasonable considering the portions. I do think the decor is a bit much as it reminds me a lot of cracker barrel but I'm not going to hold that against Big Ed's since I throughly enjoyed my meal. Will I return again? Yes! Will I return more hungry and ready to conquer the one hot cake? Yes! Do I recommend Big Ed's to other fellow southern breakfast foodie fans? Heck yes! Check them out and give them a chance to serve you a hearty and delicious southern breakfast :)"

2015-09-30,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gravy,"I've been to this restaurant twice for lunch now.  The food is very good and they open promptly at 11:00am. So far, I have ordered the risotto balls, Chicken Parmesan sandwich and the kale caesar salad. All items were suggestions from the wait staff and the items did not disappoint.  The wait staff is friendly and offer great service regardless of the size of the party.  The first time I ate here I was studying for exams during lunch. They had a table with 8 people (2 adults and 6 kids) come in and they reset the table they had set up to the back of the restaurant so that the kids wouldn't be distracting.  (The scenery is as nice back there as well). Risotto Balls: I didn't quite know what to expect with these.  I had a blank moment and forgot risotto was basically flavored rice until after I ordered it. I didn't expect something extraordinary when I thought it through in my head; however, the taste was a great mix between the herby risotto and the red sauce. The outer crust was crisp and the middle was moist and cooked perfectly. Pleasant and filling.Kale Caesar Salad: This is by far my favorite thing on the menu.  People say you can judge a good restaurant by how well they do the simple things and this salad takes the cake.  The Caesar is a great mix of parmesan cream and tart flavors; if they buy it, I want to know where so I can use it myself. The kale is chopped so it is easier to handle and tastes like it was chopped right before serving. Good presentation as well. When I visit Gravy again, this will be ordered regardless of what it goes with.Chicken Parmesan Sandwich: Gravy buys its bread from the Yellow Dog Bakery. YDB knows their bread and more importantly, the bread is able to stay crisp with the sauce from the chicken parmesan sitting on it. The chicken is tender and the breading does not flake away easily like it does whenever I attempt to make this at home.  I like a little more heat so next time I may ask for hot sauce if they have it.There is also bike parking out front. This restaurant offers good food, a thoughtful staff and reasonable prices."
2015-09-30,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Ajisai Japanese Fusion,"They do not have a bogo, however their quality can not be beat on my list for best Raleigh both in Raleigh and overall and I've tasted a lot of sushi in my time....the wait staff is very prompt knowledgeable and attentive.  The sushi is high quality fresh and delicious.  Definitely a choice for taking someone on a fancier date."
2015-10-01,5.0,"Brisbane, CA",State of Beer,"While in Raleigh stopped in for a couple of beers with one of my grad school friends.  Had the LBC Hop on Top and the Wicked Weed Freak of Nature.  Both were really tasty local IPAs that I had never had before.  My favorite thing about this place was they have a turntable and a large amount of vinyl.  I requested some Punk and they happily obliged with The Misfits Static Age.  Also, while I was having a beer the chef brought out a dessert that she was working on.  My buddy and I gave her a full critique of the dish.   If I ever get back to Raleigh I will definitely be back."
2015-10-01,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Roast Grill,"Wow great small local place to get a hot dog. Love their motto of no ketchup. Their hot dogs all the way are great and it was especially nice just talking briefly to people who seem to be regulars there. Chili and onions, and mustard never tasted so good. Absolutely love the food and the feel of having a coke in a bottle. Sweet owners and a lot of history even in their coke bottles on the wall. Been there since 1940, but not the hot dogs themselves. Those go pretty fast. Love the food and atmosphere makes you feel like a true Raleigh native."
2015-10-01,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",State Farmers Market Restaurant,"This restaurant is in a good spot...if you need fuel before hitting the farmer's market. The line that carried on out the door moved rather quickly, so that was good. You have some time to take pictures with the John Deere tractor that lives in front of the restaurant. The food was 100% southern. You may want to introduce your Yankee friends to the south by starting here. The menu had so many things I wanted i ended up ordering a la carte. You'll definitely have to go back a few times to have a good idea of the variety of offerings. This is a place to take a group. There were a lot of families and friends gathered in the wide open space. I can't say that it's my go to breakfast place, but I am 100% willing to give it another shot. There was just  a little something off about the grits that day. But...grits are pretty hard to do."

2015-10-01,3.0,"Durham, NC",The Oak,"Good bourbon, the food was less than to be desired. We always give a restaurant 3-4 times before writing a review and I can say with confidence that the several appetizers and meals that we had were just okay. The food is bland, and the combination of flavors did not mesh well on several of the meals we tried."

I sat at the bar and watched my waitress's friend hand her a Starbucks coffee which made me wonder if their  coffee was any good... The waitress then disappeared into the kitchen without at least pouring me the coffee I ordered. Then you heard lots of laughter and the waitress never came back out so I left...seems to me like there's no management.Update....I thought it was very nice for the manager to be responsive. However, I'm here on business and don't have time to visit them again and give them another chance....I would like to say to the manager thank you anyway....and please give the waitress another chance...she was at least friendly"

2015-10-01,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",David’s Dumpling & Noodle Bar,I ordered the veggie lo mien and it was alright. Veggies were not cooked that well. The veggie to noodle ratio was off.

I always get the bellini when i'm here. Also very good. Apparently the salmon pasta dish is very yummy but it's not on the dinner menu so you have to ask for it. Pricey, but you're paying for the elevated ambiance as well. Great for bday dinners/fancy dates."

2015-10-02,3.0,"Durham, NC",Capital Club 16,"As much as I've tried to get into the love that people have for Capital Club 16, I just can't help feeling ""A-OK"" after every visit. I highly recommend hitting them on a Sunday or weekday, because this place is the young professionals jam: it's always crowded and thus ensures for a noisy evening. I don't think I've been to a noisier restaurant, thus I can't recommend them for any type of intimate setting or date night (even double date night) atmosphere. It's too bad honestly, because the building itself is beautiful inside and out with fabulous decorations and even a lovely floral arrangement at every table. They usually have a handful of unique drafts and cocktails, although one might say too unique, and usually $1 up-charged for beers compared to bars around the area. You'll find a German-themed menu here with various rotating specials. I've tried numerous dishes and drinks: salads, soups, entrees, pretzels, mulled wine, etc. They have unique touches (like their assortment of mugs) but it's just not enough to pull them to a great rating in my opinion.On my most recent visit I ordered a specialty salad served with a scotch egg, figs goat cheese and vinaigrette. It was great, and to be honest, I've always been very pleased with their salads. We also tried the wild bore, served over a bed of rice with a side salad. It was good, but needed an extra punch of flavor to have wowed me. Overall, Capital Club 16 is good but not great. They serve some tasty dishes, but they're just a little over priced for the quality and party atmosphere setting. If you're going to give them a visit, just go for it and attend one of their events, they're jam-packed, but make for a great party, and it's going to be nosy and crowded either way, but at least you'll expect that at an event."

2015-10-02,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chopstix Gourmet and Sushi Bar,Used to be one of my favorite places for sushi but it's gotten progressively worse. The service is slow even though not many people are dining in when I go there. Customer service is pretty bad too. I got a specialty roll once that was pricey and the waitress misunderstood my original order... And they still charged me for the wrong order. Now I need to find another sushi place nearby.
2015-10-02,5.0,"SoHo, Manhattan, NY",Stanbury,"Super not kid friendly restaurant. If Michelin star restaurants can offer high chairs, I see no reason why this restaurant can't. I'm from Singapore and if DB Bistro by Daniel Boulud and Bread St Kitchen by Gordon Ramsay can welcome babies, why can't Stanbury? It's not fine dining, neither is the restaurant too posh or in an exquisite setting that warrants basically turning families with young children away. If that's the case you should put a big sign on your front door saying no babies. This restaurant serves tapas style dishes, and the setting is casual. So it just seems like they are trying to be fancier than what it really is. We sat to try and finish our meal despite the guy at the front telling us they don't provide high chairs, in hindsight we should have just left. Servers were not friendly or understanding about our situation with our 7month old baby rolling around in the booth, they simply ignored her presence, served our food without any kind of interaction of sorts like how a normal friendly server should be. Overall it was an unpleasant experience. The food was good, not great. Masked by presentation, the beef tartare was heavy handedly seasoned with a lot of Indian inspired spices that overwhelmed the beef itself. The crispy pig head was a patty of shredded pork. Smoked duck was tough. Bone marrow was good but I've had better. The food at this restaurant had pretty looking plates but I think a true foodie would agree with me that it's not that amazing when you see past the presentation. I was really excited to try this restaurant out from all the reviews I saw here on Yelp . Left pretty disappointed."
2015-10-02,3.0,"Garner, NC",Tupelo Honey Cafe Raleigh,"We stopped by on a Saturday afternoon recently. We had just been on a tour of the state capitol and were on our way to a tour at the rum distillary. I had been to the Asheville location on a previous trip and loved it. They have an open kitchen concept..I loved it. We were told a 30 minute wait. We went outside and I saw a few people were on the patio. We asked if it was open and was told it was a 10 minute wait. Of course they didnt just offer that option up. When we walked through I also noticed half of the tables empty. Again to me it indicates they are short staffed. We are seated and Kevin comes over and takes our order. We order teas and I order the Charleston and the hubby gets a burger. While waiting...Kevin brings us biscuits and jam which seems to be homemade and yummy. It takes forever to get our food. Mine is a grilled chicken sandwich on sourdough wheat with Havarti cheese and a cranberry mayo. It is just eh. The cheese is cold and hard..the chicken luke warm..but I really like the mayo since I cant take the normal stuff. The hubby says his burger is ok..just nothing to write home about. Kevin drops off our food and we do not see him again until he brings our bill. As a server myself this is just unacceptable to not stop by after the meal is delivered to make sure everything is ok. I had thought about dessert and he didnt mention it and we needed to get out the door..so we payed our bill and left. There are gluten free and vegeterian and vegan options. They have valet parking or there is a small parking lot around the corner. So so food and less than stellar service..again plenty of other options out there,"

I love sushi & Asian food so much, but I don't know why I had never been here before. So today, I finally visited Ajisai for lunch. They were pretty busy when I got there but as soon as I sat down, the lady who worked there got me water and menu. I was so busy looking around and checking this place out for few minutes. I loved their interesting pictures(I'm not sure y'all saw that drawing or not but this Asian lady with long sword... and sushi was on that sword..!) on the wall and I liked their dark but cozy atmosphere inside. Also, what I loved it even more was.. they had Check-in Offer! We chose Edamame(salty green bean) and it was my first time trying Edamame. Yes, it was my first time.. A lady who worked there was like ""What? You never had this before?? It's so good!"" They also had many different options for lunch menu, but we both decided to get Lunch box and oh gosh, all of them sounded so good! I am a salmon lover, so I decided to get Lunch box B, which included salmon, salmon sashimi, and rolls. Few minutes after we ordered our appetizer and main menu, we had our Edamame and hot miso soup first. Both of them were really hot, but good. And that hot Edamame was so yummy! I felt healthier just because Edamame was so green and yummy(well it's bean, of course it is healthy. duh)! I liked the fact that they added salty taste, it was not too simple but not too much. After our appetizer, we got our main menu. It was pretty big Lunch box and they all looked good. Salmon was SO soft.. As soon as I put them in my mouth, they were like melting!!!! Ah, I loved it, loved it! I also liked their tiny cute rolls, too. I am not a big fan of Guacamole, but it was pretty good!I was so full after my lunch box! I honestly thought that this place is a little bit pricey, just because it is in Cameron Village but their lunch box was $13, which isn't that bad! And plus, Check-in offer? I think that was a great deal!I loved my lunch at Ajisai and I had a great time with Lauryn! I will def come back here soon!"

First time at Chow I had the burger and fries as a side. The burger was true basic bar food. My second time coming I had there nachos. The type of chips that were used were strange and I hardly had and ground beef on the nachos. Each time I have been here I have ordered pickle chips, which both times were pretty tasty even though the breaking falls off the chips.

2015-10-03,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Irregardless Cafe & Catering,"The decor of Irregardless is great for nature lovers and it was easy to get a seat when we went for lunch. We needed to have a meeting while we were there, and the staff did not rush us out. The service was prompt, and all our orders came out correctly.   I had the shrimp and orange salad and it was wonderful. The greens were soft and fresh and cut into bite-size pieces. I had the soup of the day which was perfect on a cold rainy day, and not too salty. I also ordered peppermint tea, which was made with loose tea leaves and  very refreshing.   I would definitely recommend this to all my other health-conscious friends. The lunch prices are more affordable than dinner can be.  They have lots of seating, and it was busy when we went, but not noisy!"
2015-10-03,5.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Another Broken Egg Cafe,"Accidentally stumbled upon this place while waiting for car to be fixed on a Saturday morning. The service was amazing from beginning to end. We started with drinks. The latte was great and served in a cute store cup. The orange juice tasted so fresh that we had 2 and asked for the distributor before we left. We had the freshly baked cinnamon roll as an appetizer. Then, the entree came. We loved the omelettes. I would definitely come back here again for brunch."
2015-10-03,4.0,"Williamstown, NJ",PDQ,I stopped by mistake I thought it was a mcdonalds...inside was very clean...I ordered a salad grilled for 6.50 . It was made to order...when it came out it was amazing..I have never wrote a review but don't pass  this place up it was great

2015-10-03,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Ajisai Japanese Fusion,"This place has great sushi prices - my boyfriend and I get it to go quite often, and the two of us always think it's great. My only qualm with this place is that their tuna sashimi doesn't always taste great - makes me wonder about the quality. But otherwise, this place is a good, reliable, affordable option for sushi."
2015-10-03,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Salt & Lime Cabo Grill,"Ok so first time here. ..after we sat through agonozing pressured to order dinner.. before we left We asked why the waitress was so pressed to flip her tables, the manager was standing there and comped us appetizers for us to come back , apologized, and said that she wished we would of called upon her, that it is totally unacceptable and she would take care of it, she wanted us to come again and not let our experience steer us away..I will have to make a revisit to update my ratings due to waitress I  give 3 stars, the corn on the cob,  cobo rolls, and Chipotle chicken were 5 star..."
2015-10-03,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Ajisai Japanese Fusion,"Our server was one of three total working, two of which were new. Even though it took a minute for him to get there, our service was great and the food came out promptly and in order. We got free spring rolls for checking in. They were tasty and the dipping sauce was sweet and spicy. I got a bowl of mushroom soup, which was great to have since we were sitting outside on a kinda chilly night. I also had green tea which tasted like it was roasted, so it was kind of nutty. It was very good! Our rolls were the Tomo and the Spider-Man- which we both recommend! All in all, we will be coming back!"
2015-10-03,5.0,"Cordova, TN",First Watch,Was traveling to Raleigh on business and First Watch was down from my hotel I was staying. Decided to ditch the usually horrible hotel breakfast and try them out since I saw such great reviews on Yelp. Needless to say I was very please. Lynn service was great from start to finish. Had as you can see the blueberry multi grain pancakes and they were fantastic. Turkey Sausage was ok but it's turkey sausage. Needless to say very please with First Watch and will be a regular when visiting on business to Raleigh. Thanks for the great experience.
2015-10-03,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Death & Taxes,"Maybe because my expectations were high, but somewhat disappointing. Nice atmosphere and excellent service but the food was inconsistent. Pass on the shrimp - stuffing gave it a mushy texture. The short ribs were tough and dry. However, the mushrooms were amazing and wood grilled fish was very good. Overall, too pricey for too little food. Surprised to find a $6.00 charge for bread on the bill. Not sure I will give this one another try."
2015-10-03,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bonefish Grill,"This place is horrible. My wife and I have come here twice and they have managed to provide substandard service and bad food both times. Tonight the wait staff was obviously confused and my wife got the wrong burger - twice! It's a burger, how do you screw it up twice?"
2015-10-04,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Abyssinia Ethiopian Restaurant,"This is my first experience trying Ethiopian food and I was very excited. If you are seeking a nice ambiance this place is not for you. It's dark and kind of dingy and it reminds me of a basement there is very random decor on the wall and some cool straw hut looking things around the floor.My sister and I told the waitress this was our first time but she wasn't very helpful. I asked her to give me some suggestions and she literally told me every single item on the menu was popular. We ordered a beef sambuca? It reminds of a samosa and it came out fresh. It was good but just a little bit too greasy for my liking. Also considering she knew we never had Ethiopian food before it kinda surprised me when she just dropped of the dish with nothing else. Keep in mind Ethiopian food is eaten with your hands. I had to ask for napkins.Our main dish we got beef yawaze beef tibs and the dora wat which is a chicken dish. It comes on a big piece of bread called a injera. It was okay, nothing spectacular and I expected a lot more flavors. I love Indian food and thought this would be similar. Also, the portions are very small for the price. Each dish was 13-15$ and you get a very small side with it. We got the collar greens and the lentils. Overall, it was just okay I am not in a rush to come back and try it again"
2015-10-04,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Point at Glenwood,Great neighborhood spot for food. They have a wood fire oven so the pizzas are great and the salads are awesome as well. We live right down the road and one day we were walking by to get coffee before dinner and realized we forgot to buy lemons for our dinner and we stopped in to see if they would sell us a lemon as a shot in the dark and they gave us two for free so they are awesome!! Really nice people
2015-10-04,5.0,"Greensboro, NC",Frank’s Pizza & Italian Restaurant,The pizza is amazing and other food is wonderful. I've been over 50 different country and tried most of local pizza place. This pizza place have a so amazing food and nice and kind service and great hospitality. I can eat this pizza all day long! When you want eat pizza just go there you will see the heaven!
2015-10-04,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",BURGERFI,"A great, quality burger, yummy fries though the service and speed could use a lot of improvement. Even with a non-exsistant line and an almost empty resturant expect a 15 - 20 minute wait for a simple burger and fries. Also expect to see a whole lot of staff standing around not doing anything while you wait for your meal. Right after I arrive a woman came in apparently picking up a call in order. Despite being told it would be ready when she arrive it wasn't...And she proceeded to have to wait another 15 minutes while it was prepared. Obviously she was upset (actually she was VERY upset it seemed as she was very vocal about the wait) and despite speaking to a cook from the back still had to wait quite a bit longer for her order. Then after she left the staff proceeded to make fun of the woman from the kitchen.How do I know that? Because they have an open kitchen. And they were loud. I don't care how obnoxious a guest is, common sense says don't make fun of them where customers can see you. Totally unprofessional and makes me second guess coming here for lunch."
2015-10-04,4.0,"New York, NY",Brio Tuscan Grille,"I have been a regular for a long time, it is by far my favorite restaurant in the Triangle area and I have never once had a bad experience there.  The reason I am writing a review today is because I legitimately had one of the best dining experiences both at Brio and at any restaurant I've ever been to.  Basically I have to thank it all on our waitress Brittany (I hope that's how you spell her name).  I was a waitress once and I know how important tips are.  But my experience with Brittany was way beyond her wanting tips from us.  I've had waiters do less and still get a decent tip.  Brittany was beyond accommodating with our meals, I never thought that Brio could get even better than it already did. I really, REALLY wanted my go to dish - Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant appetizer - but because of the coupon we had (buy two entrees get one 50% off), I couldn't get it.  You know what she does, she turns your typical eggplant parmesan dish into my ""Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant"" pasta dish - instead of marinara she had the cook put the pepper sauce on it and she added shrimp.  Basically I had tears of joy running down my face as I ate this dish.  Then as I was asking to have the rest of my food boxed up (I gorged on the Bread it's so good and fresh), she asked us if we wanted some fresh bread to go.  I wanted to hug her.  Basically, this was a most wonderful and exceptional dining experience with a very, very caring waitress .  You should always, ALWAYS go to Brio period because the food alone makes it worth it.  And the waiting staff has always been amazing.  But if you want that extra bonus of exceptional, ask for Brittany.  I sure as heck will! (and Brittany ended up getting the biggest tip I've ever given.....45%)"
2015-10-04,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",BURGERFI,"Dirty dining area, screaming children, deep fried cheesy veggie SLIDER for $7, no allergen information available on the website, sub par veggies, endless regret.If you love tiny overpriced burgers this place is for you!So it all starts when I am headed out to grocery shop. Had planned to atop at Aladdins (AMAZING PLACE BTW) for a quick rolled pita before shopping. Went to the Aladdins on Falls of Neuse Road and apparently they've closed that location! Very disappointing but there is one in Brier Creek, unfortunately that's nowhere near where I needed to be. I head down to Trader Joes and see they have Burgerfi right there. I am a vegan so usually I wouldn't even think about it but nothing else appealed to me, I figured they probably had a veggie burger so I tried to pull up the menu on my phone. It said mobile friendly but the menu was not accessible on the site. I looked at yelp reviews and one said they had a veggie burger so I figured I'd take a chance, being that most veggie burgers at restaurants contain some egg or dairy products I typically don't choose them but I was just so hungry! I go in, the place is a madhouse, very windy outside so as soon as you open the door there are napkins flying everywhere, screaming children, and messy uncleaned tables. I never saw any staff clean tables or even venture into the dining area at all the entire 20-30 minutes I was there. I go to order, I ordered the vegefi without cheese, mayo or sauce. They were out of wheat buns so I had the potato bun. How does a burger place run out of buns? Seriously? Anyway the guy who took my order was nice enough, the burger was almost $7 and doesn't come with fries. I was expecting a $7 house made quinoa and fresh cut veggie burger as the menu described so I thought it might be worth it. I also got a regular order of fries (almost $5) to split with the person I was with. I also ordered a water. When the food was ready they buzzed us and we picked up. I literally laughed when I saw the food. A huge thing of fries (which were decent and not too salty) but they ""burgers"" literally looked like a slider. They were TINY and I mean TINY, a child might not be satisfied with that! The burger patty itself appeared to be DEEP FRIED! It was horrific! The toppings were abysmal and falling off the burger before I even opened it. I was starving and just spent $10 on a kids meal? Crazy. But then I bite into the ""burger""... It was mushy and somehow cheesy? The only thing I could taste was cheese. It was honestly like they took bread, ripped it up, poured in milk and egg, added shredded cheese and shredded (tasteless) carrot, stirred it up and deep fried it. I don't know if there actually was cheese inside the patty since the website doesn't even offer allergen information (what the hell is that about?!) but my stomach is telling me there was dairy of some kind in there. I am actually lactose intolerant aside from being vegan (tough life I know). It didn't taste ""bad"" per se, but all restaurants that offer a veggie burger should at least make cheese optional, not inside their patty. Really they shouldn't even have this as an option at all. I would have been happier with a large veggie salad and fries. I felt the description was highly misleading, it sounded fresh and healthy but it was basically a crabless crabcake that had been deep fried.Normally I wouldn't have been so deeply offended by a disappointing veggie burger at a burger place because I understand it's not really aimed at vegans in general but because of the price, atmosphere and misleading menu I felt I had to review this and maybe save some people a ton of cash. You can do better at Burger King I promise you! Even the beef or whatever burgers looked tiny and I didn't see a single smile in the whole place.Also, at the end of my light snack, I decided to stick it to the man and get a vanilla coke since they had the freestyle machines. I would need the energy since the food was kid sized ya know. So I take my water cup to the machine and it was out of all the flavorings! Why even have a freestyle machine if you don't have the flavors to freestyle with?Sorry not sorry, sincerely fuck this place."
2015-10-04,1.0,"Wilmington, NC",State Farmers Market Restaurant,"This is our go to eat place when we are out with Mama and Daddy. It's simple it's country and if Mama ain't cooking then this is what makes them happy. We were there for a late breakfast on Sunday. It was completely packed with a line out the door for waiting. The good thing is they move pretty fast. Important to know, they will not seat you until the entire party is in the building. They will take your name and seat others before you and then give you a table as soon as they can see your whole party. The food is country and it is good. Since we were there at 11ish, we had a variety of foods at our table. My daughter and husband had sandwiches and fries, my Mom had grits and home fries, my dad eggs and tenderloin, and I had the chicken and waffles. The portions were large and all was yummy! When I say portions were large, my plate had half a chicken on it fried all in one piece. All of it came home with me except a leg and a wing.  Our server was very nice and attentive as was the entire staff. It truly is a great place to go with family when you like want comfort food just like home! They close at 3:00 each day so it will have to be breakfast or lunch."
2015-10-04,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Casa San Carlo Italian Restaurant,"So it took me less than a week to go back and eat more at Casa San Carlo. It's seriously that good, and that consistently good.Started off with the Caesar salad. It's obvious that they make their own Caesar dressing, absolutely nothing premade about it.We had the tortellini buongustaio and a garlic and anchovies pizza for entrees. The first is a standard dish each time I go, and I've rambled about it before, but the pizza was a tasty, savory punch in the face (a good thing). The cheese and toppings are fresh and a significantly better quality than most any other italian or pizza place around.Finally we had the Italian cheesecake (it's a different style than many many be familiar with since it's not as sweet as NY style cheesecake. It also uses fresh ricotta cheese rather than cream cheese). It's house made and has just enough amaretto to be a delight.Add in the fact that we had leftovers and yeah, 5 of 5."
2015-10-04,5.0,"Holly Springs, NC",The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar,"I have been here a few times when it first opened, before I decided to start yelping my little heart out. I thought that the wait time would die down since this place is no longer new, I was wrong.. Our wait time was 30 to 45 minutes but luckily since we were being vultures at the bar we were able to get seats there to enjoy drinks and dinner!Drinks: I ended up starting out with a PUN-kin beer by Dogfish Head (you have to make sure that you pronounce it correctly, lol), Mom got a glass of Pinot Grigio and Boyfriend stuck with a water. Food: Boyfriend ordered the Thundering Herd Bison Burger with sweet potato fries, Mom got the Bento Box and I ordered two half rolls of the Burgushi: the Gobble-Gobble-ooshi and Doug's Filet Roll. Boyfriend's burger was delicious and cooked perfectly. Mom loved her Bento Box, I was able to enjoy the edamame that came with it. As far as my food went, I had no idea that you could get 2 half rolls (this comes with 4 rolls of each and the cuts are a bit larger) instead of ordering 1 full roll (this comes with 9 pieces). Both rolls were amazing but the Doug's Filet was definitely my favorite. I loved everything about it especially the filet on top and the avocado and cream cheese on the inside.Our bartender, Michelle, was awesome! I definitely will be returning."
2015-10-04,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",18 Seaboard,"This is quite possibly my favorite restaurant in Raleigh, because I love getting some good ol Southern comfort food! (Even if it is a little fancy.) My favorite meal is the grilled meatloaf and goat cheese potatoes. Last time I visited, I got the pork shank with greens. The meat was tender and falling apart, and the greens were perfectly seasoned. But honestly the best part about this place is the service and people watching. One time I dropped my fork three times (I'm a huge klutz) and the server was right there to pick it up. It happened so fast that i didn't see him come help me. The manager usually comes and asks us how everything is, which is always nice. And i liked running into local elected officials, it's a popular spot amongst that crowd.I'll visit again and again, I know what I like and it's become my default recommendation."
2015-10-04,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Garland,"A true gem of Raleigh. Great atmosphere and decor, the staff is wonderful. The owners are great people and have an incredible restaurant. The Bo Ssam is truly incredible, but you can't go wrong with the Lamb Curry or Tandoor Chicken. Even if you're just going for drinks their appetizers are impossible to pass up and the Tteokbokki, Bhel Puri and Chicken 65 are fantastic!"
2015-10-04,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Oak,"Came in for Sunday brunch, they open at 11 and there was a line (probably because they were running a Groupon). Food was good - pancakes were extremely light and fluffy (not heavy), the BLT-A was good, sourdough overtook the sandwich a bit. Jen was our server and she was EXCEPTIONAL! She works Tues, Thurs, Sun - ask for her section, you won't be disappointed. She made our visit go from good to great!"
2015-10-04,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Another Broken Egg Cafe,Really tasty food! My wife has a wheat allergy and their gluten-free pancake is her favorite. I personally have eating their Steak and Eggs traditional breakfast and must commend their cooking of the steak. Really executed to perfection.

The staff is very friendly also."

We could order our food and eat with our pup that was with us and they had bowls for our pup to drink out of.  I loved the tree hugger ! It was very flavorful in my experience. And the fries with dif sauces to choose from were amazing. We live about 35 min away but we will def be making the ride again!

2015-10-04,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",First Watch,I had the the Acapulco Express omelette and it was very good and the potatoes on the side were great. Our waitress wasn't the best and actually smarted off to my friend at one point. She did not refill our craft of water or coffee and we had to wait for condiments. Next time I go I will ask for a waitress other than her. I will be going back again.
2015-10-04,5.0,"Apex, NC",Chubby’s Tacos,"We really enjoy this place.  Apparently it will soon  be called Guacamaya.  Employee explained because of franchise opportunities, switching their name due to Chubby's already existing in other states.  It is a great inexpensive place to grab a taco.  I had The fish taco (my favorite, well prepared with lettuce and a tasty sauce).  Hubby had the torta.  First time he tried it.  While I never would have ordered it, I had a bite and it was really fresh and tasty.  Great pork, fresh salad and loads of guacamole.  He really liked the bread it was served on.  Salsa bar is great.  Although their chips aren't my favorite.  Service was good.  One of our favorites and we will continue to visit (although we rotate between here at Guasaca)."
2015-10-04,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tupelo Honey Cafe Raleigh,"Tupelo lives up to the hype! I had planned to come here for awhile and it just never happened, until this weekend. We came for brunch and upon arriving, quickly realized we should've made reservations. This place gets BUSY! We were told there would be a 1-hr wait time, and so we waited because I knew it wouldn't actually be an hour (it ended up being more like 20 minutes I think). We were then shown to our seats and after placing our order, we were given biscuits with jam and honey. Delicious! The servers were very attentive and quickly cleared our table. We ordered from the brunch menu--I got the super southern breakfast bowl and my boyfriend got the ""samlette"": a salmon omelette with capers and cream cheese. My breakfast bowl was SO yummy: grits and beans with two eggs over easy, bacon, cheese, and salsa. It was warm and gooey--perfect for the rainy morning. My boyfriend also liked his omelette. The decor is beautiful as well. It'd make a great place for a nice date or sunday brunch. I plan on coming again and trying their regular menu. Five stars from me!"
2015-10-04,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tupelo Honey Cafe Raleigh,"Food was great, service was great - valet parking is awesome because parking in DT Raleigh usually sucks BUT the coffee at Tupelo was the only real disappointment.

2015-10-04,5.0,"Apex, NC",Busy Bee Cafe,"Came here on a Sunday afternoon with a few friends. It was a very rainy, windy day so the rooftop it was a no go. We headed upstairs for a larger table but the upstairs was reserved for a party. One of the servers helped put two tables together for us. There was some wonderful music in the background with a DJ on site. Perfect tempo for dining. There was a brunch menu but I wanted fried green tomatoes so ordered the spinach burger. The fried green tomatoes were perfect, came out hot and crispy. I wasn't sure if the spinach burger was supposed to be warm since it had feta cheese and cherry tomatoes on top but it was basically room temperature. I'm thinking the flavor would've come out more if it was warm. Server was attentive to our drinks. Overall, a pretty noisy, bustling place with garage parking very close by. There is a long bar as you enter the restaurant with a lot on the menu."
2015-10-04,4.0,"Knightdale, NC",Yard House,"My wife and I celebrated our 6th wedding anniversary by having dinner at Yard House for the first time. The service was great and the food was delicious. The menu offers a lot of choices, so anyone should be able to find something they like. You will definitely leave full due to the generous portion sizes.We both had the Nashville Hot Chicken as our entree. It was different than anything else I've ever had. It consists of deep fried chicken breast, 3 sweet potato pancakes, pickles, hot honey syrup, and ranch. The waitress recommended it be eaten by pouring the hot honey syrup over the pancakes or chicken. Then get a little bit of everything on your fork and dip it in the ranch. It was awesome! The chicken was tender inside and crispy outside. The syrup had a nice little kick to it. Everything went together so perfectly.If you're looking for something different and tasty, definitely give Yard House a try. You won't be disappointed."
2015-10-04,2.0,"Downtown, Seattle, WA",Driftwood Southern Kitchen,"Haven't been here before but came for buffet brunch. It was amazing!  I'm going to rave about something that may sound crazy but they had a Bibb lettuce salad that was so good!  And some fresh corn with jalapeños, onions, shallots and yes bacon!  I would come back just for that!   The normal brunch fare was good.  But the unusual add ins made it great!  Deep fried French toast, fried chicken and prime rib were big hits with my crowd!"

2015-10-04,4.0,"Bozeman, MT",Big Ed’s North,"Very good. Standing in line was definitely worth it. The food was good, solid breakfast fare. Only criticism is the place seemed understaffed. Our server was very nice, but was so busy we had to wait a long time to tell her our order was missing some items, plus we sat around for a good while staring at our food before the flatware was brought to the table. This place is clearly making a ton of money, hire some more servers, please ! I'll be back, but not on a Saturday morning."
2015-10-05,4.5,"Jacksonville, NC",Salt & Lime Cabo Grill,"Awesome food, good service and great atmosphere.Fair warning, this place will ruin all other Mexican places for you, seriously. The restaurant is very aesthetically pleasing when you walk in, clean, well decorated, beautiful hanging lights everywhere. Their margaritas are absolutely amazing, extremely fresh and made just right. Very easy for me to say these were the best margaritas I have ever had. The food took me by surprise. Very high quality, fresh and flavorful. I had the steak fajitas. The steak was so juicy, cooked to a perfect medium, and had a very good flavor. It was laced with caramelized onions, diced red bell peppers, on top of a bed of rice. Served with 3 corn tortillas and a side ""salad"" of toppings (pico de gallo, sour cream, cheese, lettuce). I can't say this word enough, everything was just absolutely amazing. I cannot wait to go back."
2015-10-05,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Assaggio’s,"I only got the pizza here so can't speak for the rest of the menu. We ordered a large size pizza and we wanted to split it half and half of two of their gourmet pizzas but we were told they couldn't do that (gourmet pizzas have to be ordered whole) So that was disappointing. So we ordered one whole large gourmet pizza--the mona lisa. I'm a huge lover of margherita style pizza and that's what i was expecting. But if I had to sum up this pizza in one word, it'd be TOMATOES. I'm used to tomatoes being diced up atop the pizza, but this was sliced tomatoes covering the pizza. And so the the tomato slice to mozzarella chunk ratio is like 5:1. I was disappointed. My friend got a cheese and pepperoni pizza and that was delicious. So I think it was just our choice. So i'm just throwing this out there: don't get the tomato pizza! (aka mona lisa)Service was great though, which is another reason why i'm giving this place high marks. We ordered a large pizza, but they accidentally prepared us a medium size, so we got that one free and they went ahead and made us a large to bring home. Very nice!"
2015-10-05,4.0,"Chicago, IL",Sosta Café,"I was blown away by the food quality and service for the price. I got the mozzarella and pesto sandwich. The bread and mozzarella were so fresh, and the homemade couscous on the side was delightful. I really enjoyed the staff -- the owner clearly has a passion for his business. The atmosphere was very cute, like a quaint coffee shop. Perfect for a quick meal to yourself, or a longer break to get some work done."
2015-10-05,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",42nd Street Oyster Bar & Seafood Grill,"We came on a tuesday for their happy hour. I actually don't like raw oysters, so I ordered from the regular menu. Hushpuppies are to die for. I actually took some home with me! They were served hot, with butter on the side. One of the best hushpuppies I've had!I ordered the shrimp and grits which were pretty good. It was a very large portion size so you'll definitely have leftovers. Everyone loved the oysters, 75 cents each!One person from our party ordered the grilled chicken which he didn't very much like, but I sort of think the first mistake was ordering chicken at a seafood restaurant, so I'm not holding that against 42nd street! Great knowledgable staff. Cool interior, very classic---feels like you're in a 1940s jazz club or something..I can't quite describe it, but you'll know what I mean when you see it for yourself.I would definitely come again and try the rest of what this raleigh institution has to offer."

2015-10-05,5.0,"Durham, NC",Tazza Kitchen Cameron Village,"This review is based solely on my two Sunday Brunch experiences, and I really can't speak to dinner, but I've enjoyed both trips to Tazza and I don't even live in Raleigh (SoDU WHAT WHAT!?!) I've dined here about 11am on Sunday twice and can say that it's a cute spot for brunch. I've had both the Crab Eggs Benedict and the Breakfast Platter. The crab eggs Benedict was really good, but not quite enough food for a large appetite, so the second go round I went with the breakfast platter which was a decent amount of food. Tazza's coffee is also extremely good. Restaurant coffee can be hit or miss. This coffee is on point. So the reduction in a star is the because of the restroom situation. And it is a situation. One that they really need to remedy at some point. There are only two bathrooms- one men's and one women's and its really not enough for a busy restaurant. I'm not even 100% sure how the building code restroom requirement is being met here unless they've slowly added more seating since they opened..."
2015-10-05,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Oak,"My friends and I went to The Oak for brunch this past Sunday. The restaurant didn't seem prepared for the rush. As soon as it opened the place was slammed. In the madness, our table seemed to be forgotten. We somehow got our food after tables on each side of us had finished and paid. We completely understood that our server was obviously busy, but it was a bummer that we waited so long and our food wasn't hot. I'd like to try this place again sometime, but not for brunch."

Sweet potato fries are baked, burgers are good, bowls offer a lot of variety. Its maybe $10-11 for lunch (burger, sides, drink, etc) which is a lot more than McDonalds but about the same as Applebee's or something and here the food is faster and way better for you in terms of healthy options that have flavor (spicy avocado quinoa bowl) and ingredients (ie: meat without hormones, organic produce, etc). Anyway, love the new b.good."
2015-10-05,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Shuckers Oyster Bar & Grill,"I was recommended this spot by a coworker and so I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. The location is right in the middle of buzzing glenwood south. The space is beautiful, very swanky: somewhere i'd imagine you'd want to go for a 1st date or a nice occasion. We were seated promptly and started with the chargrilled oysters, which were also recommended to me. These are very good, and although a bit pricey, I think they're worth it.I got the seafood pasta, which was alright. Not the best I've had. I think I prefer the version at full moon oyster bar better. Boyfriend got crab legs which were expensive for the amount you get, but good nonetheless. I brought the review down another star because our server wasn't very helpful. She didn't seem to know the menu, so it was a little awkward when we asked her to clarify something and she had to go back and check, or responded with an ""umm"". We were also seated in the corner of the restaurant so I guess she forgot about us a lot of the time, because it took awhile for us to get the check. I think the oysters were good, but you get a much better deal at full moon I think. But this place has that upscale ambiance (which is a complete contrast to full moon's loud, very casual setting) that you might prefer."
2015-10-05,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Pho Vietnam,"I go to Pho Vietnam often mainly because I love to shop at Crossroads and it's right next to it.On Friday night the rainy cold weather made me decide it was a Pho night.I go with my boyfriend often and the service is always a hit and miss. Sometimes I get a waitress who barely speaks English and has to grab the owner or I will get one that's really on top of her game. We ordered their combination Bahn Mi and the Pork Egg rolls as an appetizers. The only annoying factor was they came after our entrees. We also had to ask twice for the beansprout/mint/jalapeno plate that accompanies all pho dishes.We also ordered a Large Pho and the Spicy Beef Soup. They were both very delicious. The broth here is by far one of the best. I think the only other place I love more is Pho Super 9 which is my very favorite Pho restaurant in Raleigh. They do serve you water but other times you can go refill your own. If you want good food and are okay with mediocre service, I highly recommend this place."
2015-10-05,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chubby’s Tacos,"My favorite place to get some tacos.I love love love their baja shrimp and baja fish tacos. I also like the spicy carne asada taco as well. Very delicious. They don't skimp on meat so I'm full after eating two tacos with the chips.I actually don't like the chicken tinga taco--I find it tends to be soggy, making the tortilla also mushy. Not a good texture.The free chips are addicting. They'll give you more and more and more so don't be shy. Especially when they also have the best sauce to go with it: the guacamole salsa one. I don't know the actually name of it, but it's the creamy green one at the salsa bar. DELICIOUS! Just thinking about that sauce right now, oh my. So yes, I highly recommend chubbys. At peak hours, there will be a line all the way to the door, but it's so worth it."
2015-10-05,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Remedy Diner,"A little underwhelming flavor-wise, but still not a bad spot to stop in and eat at. We did arrive at 2:30, and while brunch was over at 3, the waitress said they were not allowing any more brunch orders which was disappointing. I got the Underground, which was a take on a Philly Cheesesteak -- pretty good! My friends ordered more deli-esq sandwiches which were pretty basic, but nothing bad. Might go here again for the brunch option, or to grab a drink since the atmosphere was cool and the staff was friendly."

2015-10-05,5.0,"New York, NY",Big Ed’s City Market Restaurant,"Stick-to-your-ribs classic Southern breakfast food in a diner-like atmosphere. We came here on a Saturday morning around 9:30am, which was early enough to avoid the weekend brunch crowd lines. The place is pretty huge, but given its popularity, it's always crowded, with lines wrapping around the block on the busy weekends, and even weekdays. Locals, tourists, and large families alike flock here, which is a testament to the food and the friendly atmosphere. Given that we were in for some hiking later that morning/afternoon, we wanted to carb load a little bit, so we went kinda crazy with our order. Ended up ordering the biscuits and gravy, the fried Cajun biscuit, bacon biscuit, corned beef hash, pancakes and sausage. Maybe a little bit too much for 2 people, but who cares? When they brought all the food out, I was completely dumbfounded. I had no idea the pancakes were the size of frisbees, and that the biscuits were also very largely-proportioned. The corned beef hash didn't look very appetizing, but was actually very good. The sausage gravy was pretty bomb too. Since the biscuits themselves were relatively dense, the gravy didn't completely soak through, leaving a really nice velvety texture to the entire dish. But that fried Cajun chicken biscuit though. At only $4, it's a very well-sized biscuit sandwich, and the chicken is so moist and flavorful that you don't even really need any hot sauce or anything. In all, we ended up having to take most of the pancake and the sausages back home with us.Our servers were very patient and super friendly. Prices were very reasonable, with our entire order only being about $25 between the two of us, including tax and tip. The food in itself is nothing really fancy, but it is delicious and hearty, and that's all you can really hope for. I'll definitely be back for a heart-stopping breakfast the next time I'm in Raleigh."
2015-10-05,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kimbap,"Tiny portions, high prices. It just doesn't make sense.We came excited to try some modern korean food, and the menu sounded amazing. I ordered the dumpling entree expecting it to be a meal. What I got in return was measly 6 dumplings. And it was like $9-10. Am I missing something here? How do dumplings cost that much!? and how was that supposed to fill me up!?Boyfriend got bibimbap with pork on top. Also expensive, also not as large as the portion you'd get at any other korean joint. A big reason I enjoy eating korean food is that even though it tends to be pricey, you get HUGE PORTIONS. and this place did not deliver.I'm sorry, but I'll stick to the more traditional korean restaurants to get my fix."
2015-10-05,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Pho Far East,"Eh, this place is decent. It is pretty good pho, but it's expensive. It is probably the most popular pho place in the area so it gets very packed on the weekends and at dinner time. Service was good, no complaints there. I judge a pho place by 1) oiliness of broth 2) amount of noodles 3) amount of meat 4) amount of free veggies on the veggie plate. oh and 4) flavor of broth sans hoisin sauce and sriracha. 1) broth here isn't oily. they know how to make proper pho broth.2) good amount of rice noodles! I hate it when pho places skimp on this but pho far east didn't disappoint.3)I got a decent amount of brisket (pho tai) and was pretty impressed. I do like my pieces cut thinner--these were a bit thick, but still very much edible. 4) yes! extra lime wedges! also hate it when restaurants only give out when lime wedge per person eating. there was also a lot of bean sprouts and other veggies. very good.5) very tasty. there is a reason everyone comes here for pho.Just wish it wasn't like $9-$10 bucks for a bowl of pho like whattttttt"

2015-10-05,4.0,"Morrisville, NC",Busy Bee Cafe,We were here just for the small plates on a rainy Sunday evening with friends. Ordered loaded tots (without bacon and sour cream) and beetroot crostini. Both turned out to be amazing. I felt the loaded tots could have been more crispier. I would highly recommend these to vegetarians. The service was very friendly although we felt the waitress was in a hurry. Slightly on the pricier side but its okay to spend money on tasty food once in a while. Would definitely be back!
2015-10-05,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Pho Far East,"With all the rainy weather we've had recently, I was craving a hot bowl of pho and knew that Pho Far East would satisfy that craving. But I think everyone else had the same idea, because this place was packed! We arrived around 8PM on a Friday and all their tables were full, with many more people pouring in the door. Luckily, we were sat right away as another couple was leaving. So if it is cold and rainy weather, you might be in for a little bit of a wait. Our order was taken quickly, despite how busy they were. We ordered the #26 for an appetizer, which is papaya salad with pork and shrimp, served with shrimp chips. This is the second time we've ordered it and it was delicious and refreshing! The dish did take awhile to come out, but it is understandable since the dish takes a good amount of prep and is not good if prepared in advance. I think it also took longer to come out during this visit, because they were so busy. For my main meal, I ordered the #36 Pho, which had meatballs, eyeround, and shank. Their standard bowl is huge! I was only able to eat half and took the other half home for delicious leftovers. They balance the portions between broth, noodles and meat very well and it is probably my favorite bowl of pho I've had in the Triangle. They give you plenty of bean sprouts for your pho and the table has all the sauce you need to flavor your pho to your liking.If you are interested in something else besides pho, I've also had the #60 Banh Hoi too. This dish is also incredibly fresh and delicious. While it is a bit pricier than the pho, you are still getting your money's worth with the amount of food they give you. I enjoyed ordering this, because this is not a meal that I would EVER be able to make at home, with the thin rice noodles. While service was a little slow this particular visit, it did not really bother me. For this type of food, it is to be expected if you want good quality. I much rather wait a little longer for freshly made food than be served quickly with food that has been sitting around waiting to be ordered. They get a very strong 4.5 stars from me! If you are looking for a good Vietnamese meal in the Triangle, then this is the spot to try!"

Then convince your boyfriend/girlfriend/friend-friend to get fries just so you can make sure you've covered all your bases of deliciousness.Overall, great place to take guests from out of town since there will almost always be seating (lots of tables) and everyone likes a beer wall!"

2015-10-05,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chuck’s,"This is a gourmet burger spot in downtown--one of the few places that doesn't offer a build-your-own. You can choose from 6-7 burgers that they've already created from their menu. i chose the spirit animal which had cream cheese and roasted peppers. Yeah, you can get non-burger sandwiches here but don't do that. It's chucks: you get a burger.Burger was pretty yummy, but I wasn't a fan of the cream cheese..I know the whole point is to NOT sub out anything but I guess I'm just a simpleton who likes her cheddar.. The fries here are amazing though. You get a couple sauces to come with it, and I highly recommend the comeback sauce. Garlic aioli is also very flavorful.Interior is very cool, and the way the tables are placed very close to each other, it makes you feel as if you're dining alongside the other tables. I liked it, but I can see how some people won't. It's definitely cozy in this little space!Still, I loved it. Fun, casual, and great service."
2015-10-05,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Clouds Brewing,"My friend had told us about this cool new brewery bar that had a froyo type dispensing wall and when we looked it up on the website, we knew we had to check it out for ourselves. We came on a Saturday night and it actually wasn't THAT packed, which is awesome. The interior is pretty spacious, pretty modern and clean. But we didn't see the wall. We basically had to walk around and it was funny, because even though the rest of the bar was well populated, there was nobody at the wall! which is the coolest part of this place! Oh well their loss, my gain. What I didn't like most at clouds though was, after we ogled at the wall for a bit, when we were ready to proceed to actually using it, we had no idea what to do. There wasn't any server or hostess or any one else around to explain how it worked, etc. So for like 2 minutes, the whole group of us just kind of wandered around looking for someone who worked there to ask how to drink from the wall. Very frustrating. I'm not saying that they should assign a server to just stand by the wall, but at least have all the employees aware that people may come in wanting to use it, so maybe keep an eye out for people awkwardly standing by it.Anyways, we finally found out that we have to go through the bartender to get our bracelets. This sort of took a while because this is the same bartender that is serving drinks to a bunch of other people. So I felt bad to the other patrons that we took time away from the bartender who had to fetch us our bracelets and get our accounts/ID cards set up.FINALLY we got our bracelets and tried it out on the wall. Basically you put your bracelet up to a sensor that will recognize you and then you can pour as much as you want in your glass and it'll charge you by the oz to the card linked to that bracelet. Very cool. I thought it was going to be gimmicky and not work well but it was actually pretty smooth sailing once you understood how it worked. Unfortunately, i think 2 of the taps out of 10 were out so we only got to sample 7-8. But hey that's enough for me. There was enough variety in the 8 taps that it satisfied everyone and you got to try something very different each timeWe ordered their appetizers and that was one of the highlights of clouds actually. The pretzels and the loaded chips were DELICIOUS! we ordered each of them again because it was so good. And you don't have to feel bad about it because it was so cheap (each plate was $4). The dispensing wall was pretty inexpensive as well, but that obviously depends on how much you pour yourself. Great concept, awesome hangout spot. Oh, and they have a parking lot!"

2015-10-05,5.0,"Las Vegas, NV",The Fiction Kitchen,"Can we drop the revolting fake-meat descriptions from vegetarian restaurants?  Look, I am a straight man; I like women. When I describe my orientation to people, I don't say, ""I like non-men,"" or ""I like fake men.""  I like women. What is the POINT, someone educate me, in calling it FAKE MEAT. Why are vegetarian businesses so insecure that they can't simply own what they are? Are you ashamed? STOP IT. This nonsense should stop RIGHT NOW.  Take a stand, Fiction Kitchen. Imagine--if you will--Indian chefs stop calling it palak paneer and replace it with appetizing descriptions like, ""palak fake-paneer,"" if they replaced the cheese with something non-dairy. It is absurd! It would never happen. So why are we doing it? Be the world's first to throw out ""Fake Chicken and Waffles,"" and replace it with ""Succulent Crispies & Waffles.""  Use your brains and create a name that will become etched in the next edition of Webster's. Have we really lost our ability to be creative? Is language unable to evolve with our cuisines? Did creativity die somewhere along the way of inventing new cuisine to meet new demands in the 21st century? wtf. WTFRant complete, here's my review: I am a big fan of Fiction Kitchen. I helped crowdsource or crowdfund-whatever them back when they were being born. Raleigh needed them, *I* needed them, and here they are, meeting and exceeding our needs. I have been 5 or 6 times at least, and brought visiting veg friends here. TFK is consistently good, service impeccable, the Kitchen of TFK open and observable. My favorite place to sit is at the bar. Bar staff mix mean drinks, or pleasant drinks, whatever your preference. Staff is happy, often sweet and cute, social, always attentive, yet never in your FACE getting in your business. I love the art on the walls, little rotating galleries. Some of it is full-on weird, borderline uncomfortable or out of place. I love that. Chances are you will love TFK.

2015-10-06,5.0,"West End, NC",Casa San Carlo Italian Restaurant,"I have gotten takeout here a couple times and have been pretty impressed. The second time I came I ordered the chicken Francese (being a personal Italian favorite of mine) that comes with pasta with marinara, although I subbed it for vodka sauce. When I got there the owner greeted me at the hostess stand and I told him I was picking up and he let me know it would be about 5 more mins. I was happy to wait, although the waiting area is very awkward, as you are sitting in the aisle literally right in front of the hostess stand as people are coming in and out. After about 10 minutes I started to get frustrated. I hadn't seen the owner since I got there (given, he was greeting and talking to other tables) and I knew he was the only one that knew I was waiting for my order. He finally walked by and saw me and remembered, walked to the back, and returned with my order. He apologized profusely as he could tell I was frustrated. He then offered me a free cannoli (yum!) and when the cashier asked if the vodka sauce was extra, he replied no not this time, which I assumed only to mean that normally they would. And when I got home and opened the lid I could tell why! The vodka sauce was AMAZING, for sure one of the best I've ever had. Full with meat and seasoning; so hearty. Unfortunately the chicken Francese did not live up to my hopes. Flavorful, but not flavorful enough for me. However it was a very large portion. Overall, I will be happy to go back, if nothing else but for that vodka sauce!"

They have a variety of breakfast/lunch items on the menu from omelettes, Benedict, scrambles, to salads, soups and sandwiches. On this visit, I got a omelette called  'Acapulco express'. It had cheese, green chiles, and chorizo in it, with a side of home-fries and salsa. It was very tasty, but if I would've enjoyed it more if the egg was cooked less. The egg was WAY over cooked and tasted rubbery almost. My sister got a fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice, which was really fresh and yummy! She also got the pumpkin pancake, and like the description says on the menu- it was humongous! Definitely couldn't finish it on her own. Overall, I think the portion sizes are great and that's a plus! I'm giving it a 4-star because the egg was over cooked and not pleasing to eat. Everything was great!

Parking can be tricky on Seaboard at lunch time, so it makes sense to aim for an earlier lunch unless you are very patient. The SSam lettuce wraps were delicious, as was the kimchi that came with it. Portions aren't huge, but I prefer that, and the food was carefully done. We did have a bit of a delay with some of the food when I went with a larger party of 8 at lunchtime. The lemongrass custard dessert was amazing. Very creamy and not overly sweet.Kimbap isn't what I'd call ""traditional"" Korean cuisine, but it's a lovely restaurant and a nice alternative to some of the usual downtown lunch places. I'll definitely keep coming back!"
2015-10-07,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kimbap,"We've been here 3 times now and every time was amazing!  Thursdays are the best, $45 for a bottle of wine and 3 items from the menu.  The pork belly nori tacos are my fav with the Korean pancakes as a close second!  The staff has always been helpful and friendly.  Can't wait to visit again."

2015-10-07,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Soo Café,"My beau and I are big fans of the chicken wings with the old fashion sauce.  It's the perfect blend of crispy, hot, sour and sweet all in one.  The only downside is that they only serve the wings a la carte."

2015-10-07,3.0,"Cary, NC",Death & Taxes,"After sitting down it took 20 min for our waiter to come over. He explained he had some great values on wine. I asked him which bottles and he pointed out one for $140 and another for $150..seriously?!?! I then asked him for a whiskey sour and a bottle red wine. He ran away and we waited for another 35min. I then went to the hostess and asked where our wine was. He came over and  brought our wine but no cocktail after waiting 50 min! This was at 8:30pm dinner, the rush was over! I then asked where my whiskey sour was and he ran away. Came back 10 min later and told me they couldn't find any eggs?!?! We were off to a great start.Ordered just about everything...tomatoes were ok nothing special. Bone marrow had 2 pieces, one had maybe a thimble of marrow in it and was a waste. Oysters were good. I am all for properly cooked meats but chicken was extremely under cooked. Red blood was dripping from the bones. Pork was overcooked, tough, and had little flavor. Finished all that and wondered where our mushrooms were that we ordered as a appetizer. He clearly forgot and brought them with desert? Seriously?! Lots of tables crammed into a small space and it is very loud. Don't expect to have a conversation with anyone besides the person next to yo. Ashley has clearly taken her eye off the ball and has lead to poor execution across the board from bar to kitchen to service. Her food is getting sub par and service down hill. And be expected to spend some serious money along the way. There are now way to many good restaurants in Raleigh to go back."

2015-10-08,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Lee’s Kitchen,"This place is such a great find! One of my co-worker's recommended it to me and I love it. It is truly a hidden gem on capital blvd.I am not a fan of the location it is right next to the pawn shop that closed, but minus that it's a great place. There is not a sitting area so you can only pick up orders.I highly recommend their veggie platter. They have a great selection of mac and cheese, mixed veggies(cabbage), the best string beans i've ever had, and great rice. They also have plantains and collards as a side. I have tried their curry chicken which is delicious  but it does have bones in it. This is my lunch spot, I try to come here once a week."
2015-10-08,5.0,"Durham, NC",Taza Grill,"Love this place for a quick, good lunch. The staff are ALWAYS super friendly and want to make sure you get the right amounts of everything. Gyro meat is flavored perfectly and I really like their Tzatziki sauce. And definitely buy the Pita when you're there. It's better than Aladdin's and Neomonde! And the portion of Hummus you get is AWESOME. Super creamy!Also, their baklava is good. Highly recommended if you're looking for a quick, tasty lebanese lunch!"
2015-10-08,5.0,"Castle Hayne, NC",Backyard Bistro,"Great place to watch sports, and really good food. Great beer selection too.  Can't expect miracles for a quick meal before a Canes game because everyone else has the same idea! But always had a great experience."
2015-10-08,5.0,"Denver, CO",Despina’s Cafe,"First time going here, loved it! It's family-owned. Met the daughter, super friendly chick - she said her parents were currently in Greece. This place is legit! Ordered a caprese panini and got a side of macaroni salad. That salad was fantastic. I wish I could order it in bulk for a party and claim it as my own! The caprese could have had more pesto/basil and thicker slices of mozzarella, but it was great for a light lunch. I'd recommend ordering it with chicken if you're looking for something more filling.Great ambiance and feel to the place. They make everything fresh in house. I couldn't resist and left with a lemon and lavender scone!"
2015-10-08,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Ni Asian Kitchen,"Got a great order of Shrimp Chow fun here, my co workers also all liked the stuff they got. They dont skimp on the proteins here which is a big plus in my book and will keep people coming back. Its a rather small place but has plenty of parking and I am looking forward to going back and trying more stuff. Unfortunately they dont do the specialities as lunch specials so you end up the dinner price but for more traditional dishes, you can get them at lunch prices."

2015-10-08,4.0,"Norfolk, VA",Shaba Shabu,"I have to say, it was so good, I went there on two separate nights.  My first night, I arrived late and was starving from travel.  Felt like some sushi (Hey, I get to expense it!!!) so sat at the sushi bar.  I was the only one in the room, but I enjoyed the quiet.  Turns out they have a BOGO menu!! I ended up getting 4 rolls for the price of two, which put my tummy and my wallet at ease.  The freshness and quality of the rolls was solid, and I was on board immediately.  I definitely recommend the Shabu roll for sure.  The next night I came with coworkers and gave the Thai a try.. WOW!!!  Their Red Curry was outstanding!!  I was hoping for leftovers, but I couldn't stop shoveling it in.   As for the place itself, very clean, and broken into 3 areas that I could see.  My first night was the Sushi bar side, with Islands to sit at , or high tables.  The middle and other sections were restaurant style seating with roomy comfortable booths.   The wait stafff is very accommodating, even if you're a table full of smart alleks!!!  Our waitress looked a LOT like Jodie Foster and one of our guys just couldn't let it go.. ha!!.   I know I have more training down there, and if I end up at the same hotel, there is a lot of menu that I have yet to explore.  Need to get down there soon!!!"
2015-10-08,5.0,"Durham, NC",The Mecca Restaurant,"This place is the real deal.  Attentive staff, who revel in the ""Mecca"" vibe.  Was meeting fiends and we were not rushed--they made sure we had what we needed without being intrusive or sycophantic.  Burger was great--meat really good and the whole sandwich had been toasted in the sandwich press.  Our group asked to have our photo taken and the staff was glad to help.  How have I missed this place all these years?  Prices and food were great!  Lots of cool signed ""celebrity"" photos like NC Supreme Court and Clay Aiken.  Raleigh in a nutshell."
2015-10-08,5.0,"Norfolk, VA",The Remedy Diner,"great vegan food and even better service! I'm from Norfolk, Virginia so it's nice to find vegan comfort food! I will be coming back next time I'm in town."
2015-10-08,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Pho Far East,"I've eaten a lot of Vietnamese food in my time and Pho Far East is one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants in Raleigh. Everything is reasonably priced and the food is very authentic. There's only one size of pho here and it is huge! I usually get the pho with flank, meatballs, and eyeround. This is a good bowl of pho to order because it comes with all the meats. The broth is very good and hot enough to cook the meat perfectly. They give you a lot of meat too and the bean sprouts, mint, and fresh jalepenos are a must to complete my bowl of pho. For the price, size, and quality, the pho is a must here.If you're looking for something that other Vietnamese places might not offer, the Gio Du Du is really good. Its a green papaya salad with fresh shrimp and pork served with shrimp chips and fish sauce. It's a little pricey at $15, but its some of the best I've had in Raleigh and isn't offered at too many places. The papaya is fresh and shredded very nicely and the fish sauce compliments everything really well. I would also recommend the Banh Hoi if you want something really authentic that I have yet to see anywhere else. Its basically thin rice noodles that are cooked and pressed together to form a sheet and you eat them with fresh vegetables and grilled pork and shrimp. Its similar to the Thit Nuong, which is the rice noodle bowl version. Overall, the food at Pho Far East is very good and is really authentic Vietnamese food. I would give them 5 stars because I love Vietnamese food and its some of the best you can get in Raleigh."
2015-10-08,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Pho Far East,"Quick, delicious, and hearty meal.  Got the house special pho, which has just about every part of the cow.  Delicious.  The broth was unctuous and flavorful, meat was tender, and noodles were perfect.  A great place for lunch.  Highly recommend!"

2015-10-08,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Stanbury,"I had Stanbury for the first time last night and it was absolutely amazing. I was incredibly impressed by the menu. We had bone marrow, pigs head, tartare, and goat tongue. I am not usually a fan of tartare but they did it perfectly. The drinks were delicious. The ambiance was relaxing and we had a great conversation with our server. I would definitely recommend Stanbury should you ever be in the Raleigh area."
2015-10-08,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mitch’s Tavern,"I went to Mitch's for lunch and got the London broil sandwich with a cup of gumbo on the side. The London broil was decently tender and really flavorful. The marinade it was cooked in really infused the meat with a nice depth of juiciness with every bite. They do not skimp on the London broil either; you get a half lb. of juicy meat with a warm pink center. I was thoroughly pleased with how it was cooked and had the perfect ""rareness."" The melted cheese and herb mayo were also great complements and the toasted bread was really good. The bread was surprisingly soft and really made the sandwich along with the meat. I also tried the gumbo and it was tasty and had great quality ingredients. It was missing the great Cajun spices you'd expect from an authentic New Orleans gumbo, but there were huge chunks of sausage and ham as well as nice vegetables. Overall, the food was pretty good for the cheap price and was better than my last visit. I'll increase my rating to 4 stars because of the good food and really cheap prices."
2015-10-08,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Ajisai Japanese Fusion,This place has the best lunch special! $12 for three full size sushi rolls (none of that 4 pieces bull) and soup/salad. Definitely the best lunch special in the area that I've found! I tried going to Mura in North Hills for their lunch special but it cost me $15 for only two small rolls and no soup or salad....Now I make the drive to Ajisai.
2015-10-08,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Death & Taxes,"Death & Taxes is for sure different than AC's other Raleigh dining hot-spots (Beasley's, Chucks, Poole's, etc). This is her step into the fine dining world, and as such the price tag on the bill at the end of the night is going to reflect that. So my advice upfront is to go into D&T mentally prepared to drop some dough if you're looking to have a few plates, a few drinks, maybe a dessert.That being said, my girlfriend and I had a really great experience eating here. First off, the restaurant is beautiful. An open kitchen design lets you see right into the belly of the beast, with chefs and line cooks plating dishes, grabbing bread baskets and literally battling the cooking flames from the massive wood burning stove (would love a bar spot next time for a front row seat of this fiery tango...)We also really loved all the dishes we got (full disclosure: I cheated and scoured other Yelper's reviews to see what was worth / not worth my credit card swipes. Not sorry about it.) We took a tapas style approach, ordering a few of the smaller plates and bread to share and brought out in courses. Bread Side Note: order the bread! Whole wheat sourdough is on point.This was great because it gave us a lot of things to share / taste, and our server was INCREDIBLY helpful the whole time, and even coursed out our dishes so they didn't bum rush the table all at once.The 'foraged and fought for' mushrooms were fantastic, very earthy and hearty with a tangy kick to them. Paired that with the beef short rib for a great starter course. Then we moved on to the fire roasted gourds with goat cheese, pecans and muscadine grapes. This was an interesting dish, with lots of different textures and flavors playing well off each other. Not sure if I would get it again, but I wasn't upset about it. Plus now I can say I've eaten gourds.My favorite dish, both from a taste and a cool-ness factor, was the grilled octopus with butter beans. This was smokey, tender yet slightly chewy, with the octopus pieces literally embodying all that amazing wood grilled flavor. The beans and charred peppers went really well with this.All in all, I enjoyed what D&T had to offer. It's a different experience than other AC restaurants, but a welcome experience in my opinion. Put on a tie, order a cocktail, maybe the octopus, and enjoy your night as Daddy Warbucks."
2015-10-08,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Big Ed’s North,"I had an amazing breakfast at Big Ed's North this morning. A basic 2 eggs w/ meat. I opted for over easy, nahunta pork patty and home fried potatoes. The food was prepared exactly to order and the service was great. I highly recommend this location."
2015-10-08,5.0,"Covington, KY",MOD Pizza,"Decent ingredients on a thin cracker style crust.  Toppings are free, you only pay for the size of the crust.  The freedom with toppings makes this a great choice.  It's a little more expensive than Max's across the street in the food lion parking lot.  I come here when I don't want single topping pizza for lunch."
2015-10-09,4.0,"Apex, NC",Abyssinia Ethiopian Restaurant,Absolutely a fabulous experience . My daughter and I ordered separately but shared a table platter. The food was flavorful and very fast. We would definitely go back.
2015-10-09,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sawasdee Thai Restaurant,"I'm giving this place two stars because the food is actually pretty good. However for the amount of food you get, its not worth the trip or cost of the food. I will not eat here again because there are better places where I feel that I can get a good value. I've eaten here about five times over the past eight years and today I really realized it's just not worth it. I sat in traffic on capital Blvd and when I returned to work I found out that there was not much in the to-go tray. They left it up to me to pour the sauce on (I don't know if that was a good or bad idea). The point is, if you're hungry, you might want to stay away from this place or pay for overpriced food to get full. I want to like this place but I'll just say no for now. Maybe the Glenwood location is better?"
2015-10-09,3.0,"Fuquay Varina, NC",J Betski’s,"We've been to J Betski's a couple of times now and are definitely fans.  The first time was on Valentine's Day with a pre-set menu, and the most recent time was just a random date night.  Both times, the food and service have been top notch.  I'm not sure I would classify J Betski's as a classy or elegant restaurant and feel like going in your jeans on a date night is perfectly fine.  There were a couple of tables that were a bit more dressed up, but to be honest, the atmosphere and semi-close quarters do not warrant any type of extra fancy outfit.The food - delicious!  We ordered two types of pierogies - the mushroom one and then there was a cheese one on special (three in each order).  SO delicious - and sadly, between the two of us, we ate ALL of them.  Really flavorful and perfect.  For dinner, I had the schnitzel.  REALLY tasty...the meat itself was perfection, the potatoes were spot on, the lingonberries were a perfect addition, but the only thing I could've done without was the dill-cucumber salad.  I wish there would've been another type of salad or something, or maybe even spaetzle if you want to get really crazy!  Service has been friendly and prompt both visits, no complaints here!  There's a good beer and wine selection.  Overall, J Betski's is definitely worth a visit because it's amazingly delicious."

2015-10-09,5.0,"Ashburn, VA",Pho Far East,"Continuing my quest to try different Pho places in my Raleigh travels, today I tried this place. Broth is not as oily as Mo-Te Pho, and definitely had a stronger roasted garlic (and possibly ginger?) flavor. You will definitely finish the soup with a strong roasted onion aftertaste. Did I find that off-putting? Maybe a little. The bowl has a good broth/noodles/meat ratio. It was (pleasantly) hard to stir and I felt I got a good amount of meat in the soup. I got the regular size and felt I got a good meal. They offer a super size bowl for 50% more and my god it's HUGE! No way anyone eats that in one sitting. The only awkward moment was when a waiter ordered the wrong appetizer for the table across the restaurant. The manager proceeded to yell at the waiter for 5 minutes. You ever been yelled at for 5 minutes? Totally awkward. I'm not sure what he was saying (I don't speak that language) but I'm pretty sure it wasn't good. Will I come back? If I can get the broth without big onion pieces, I'll give it another go."

2015-10-09,4.0,"Durham, NC",DeMo’s Pizzeria & Deli,"We've ordered pizza from DeMo's at least three times now, and have never been disappointed.  Granted, we've only ever tried one pizza- the stuffed pepperoni pizza- because it's sooo good, and we can't help but want it every time! Generous servings of pepperoni and cheese.  Their hot wings are really memorable too.  Unlike your typical soggy, orange buffalo wings, these wings are nice and dark brown, lightly coated with hot sauce and red pepper flakes.  We're still trying to figure out how they make their wings because they are really crispy and flavourful all the way through!  Finally, we've also had a chance to taste their sandwiches, which are filled very generously and are extremely delicious.  We noticed that they use premium Boar's Head deli cuts for their sandwiches, which explains their quality.  I suppose we'll eventually get around to trying their other pizzas...although I suspect we aren't going to get tired of the stuffed pepperoni pizza anytime soon!"
2015-10-09,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chuy’s,"Couldn't wait to bring my son here when he came to town and we were most disappointed.  My husband and I have always had a good experience here but today was what I'm hoping was a fluke. The service was just ok, nothing to brag about. They were out of many things, including their Tres Leche cake, which is our main draw to this restaurant. This is a little surprising as it was a Friday-not a great way to be stocked-or not-for the weekend and concert night. With the array of restaurants to chose from, this isn't a good way to manage an establishment."

I was pretty pleased, so pleased I went back for dinner and got the Galbi again along with teriyaki chicken for my daughter. I liked the extras that came with the Galbi lunch box. In the box was tempura sweet potatoes, a piece of sushi, a little shredded cabbage and tempura mushrooms in a very interesting sauce. It also came with a side salad with sesame dressing that should be bottled!Thanks to Samantha, the manager, for being nice and helpful."
2015-10-10,4.0,"Virginia Beach, VA",Backyard Bistro,"Everything from the food, the service, the bar drink, and especially the hockey game we were looking for on the big screen was the best we've experienced in a long time.

The sauce, I wanted to scoop up on a spoon it was so good. The gnocchi were really light and tasty. I had a side salad with blue cheese that was so fresh and full of blue cheese chunks. Drinks were fairly priced. And they had a fun selection of canned beers like Schlitz and PBR. While I find them disgusting, it's  a fun throwback. My friend had the Hawaii 5-O pizza. I had a bite. The crust was super yummy. Definitely enjoy this tiny little place. We left before 10. Which is when I understand the music changes and it gets really crowded."

They had been here many times and had regaled me with how wonderful this place was.As a French person and a food lover, I have a tendency to have high expectations for a restaurant that claims to do French dishes and while I have no idea of the costs of the meal [as I wasn't paying ;) ], the quality of the meal was truly worth the detour - delicious, elegant and leaving wanting more. It was traditional and each dish was truly recognizable while still having a small flair of inventiveness.The pace of the meal was appropriate for this type of restaurant, the mannerism of the staff were spot on, the ambience [noise level, music, volume in the restaurant] was very pleasant. As a lover of art, if there was one thing to say of any critical nature, it would be to refresh the art on on the walls...I hope that the people of Raleigh, NC have St. Jacques around for a very long time to come."
2015-10-10,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",J Betski’s,On 10-10-2015 my wife and I  ate lunch. I had the beet salad which was very good. She had a hamburger and fries.

There was no charge for the burger and one of our chocolate  torte desserts was free. The dessert was real good. This was our first trip.  We'll give them one more try because they were nice.

2015-10-10,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Big Al’s BBQ,"Pretty decent brisket.  There's a zillion sauces to choose from--which is both good and bad.  Good in the sense that you can sample a zillion sauces, bad in the sense that its sort of overwhealming.Sides are pretty standard, prices is a lil' pricey, but over all it beats the hell out of Dickeys or some other chain place.Definitely give it a shot."
2015-10-10,2.0,"Houston, TX",Jimmy V’s Osteria & Bar,"I've been here for a conference and have really enjoyed everything here. The seating was prompt, despite the fact that the place was almost always hopping with business. The chocolate expresso brownie and the Pinot Noir were awesome. The shrimp grits ravioli was yummy and unexpected -- great combination of flavors.   I also enjoyed (at another sitting) the wood fired pizza. Can't remember which one, but it was good.Really impressed!"
2015-10-10,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bahama Breeze,"I can't say enough how wonderful the dining experience was at bahama breeze. From the time we walked in, were greeted by Chris and then served by Kourtney, it was such a good dining experience. My date was so delighted he told the manager about our experience. I ordered the coconut shrimp with sweet mashed potatoes, and broccoli."

2015-10-10,4.0,"Palmetto, GA",DeMo’s Pizzeria & Deli,In town for a hockey game and found DeMo's on yelp. What a find!  Excellent NY style pizza. Delivery took about an hour but it was worth the wait. We ordered a pizza with mushrooms and sausage. It was cooked perfectly and the taste is far above any chain restaurant pizza.
2015-10-10,5.0,"Norfolk, VA",Mi Cancun,"The Mexican food I've been longing for!!!!Some like it hot as do I! Delicious salsa not for those mild tastebuds. Best margarita I've had in a long time and excellent service to compliment the scrumptious eats. Love the atmosphere and lots of TVs for the sports fans. Please give this place a try, you will not be disappointed"
2015-10-10,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Fu Kee Express,"First time ordering Chinese food since we moved here so we turned to yelp. We ordered 5 mins before closing but he stayed open long enough for us to get there to pick it up. We ordered the crab Rangoons, sesame chicken, and general tao's chicken. Everything was very delicious and plentiful. We probably could have ordered only one dish and been fine. Will definitely be back. The employee/owner? was super friendly."
2015-10-10,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Soo Café,"Absolutely Korean Fried Chicken Greatness I had the SOCA and my wife had the ORIGINAL. The funny thing is the ORIGINAL is suppose to be the milder flavor but I found it to be a bit more spicier than my SOCA. But my wife found the SOCA to be milder than her ORIGINAL. But they were both an absolute explosion of flavor  in your mouth. What can I say I will definitely be back I'm a fan. Great Service, Great Decor, Great Food what more could anyone ask for ???? I was told about this place a while ago and now I'm kicking myself for not investigating sooner. They have awaken my taste buds and they now crave Korean Fried Chicken!!!! :-)"
2015-10-10,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Death & Taxes,"Food quality was very good, portion to price ratio was ridiculous.  Snapper special was wonderful, we tried many dishes, oysters were very good, but you needed a microscope to find them in the shell, and this is a 'R' month, very disappointed.  Shrimp looked tasty, but by the time you peeled them and removed the head, the shrimp were tiny too, not impressive.  Steak was excellent, not too much fat, but again price was astronomical, much prefer Bruno in Wakefield or downtown Sullivan's or McCormick chains where you have tons of left overs, the potatoes were excellent though as were the deserts we tried, but for the price, $110 per person when done, you shouldn't come home hungry and we all did!"
2015-10-10,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Flying Burrito,"Definitely my go-to spot for delicious Tex-Mex. The tacos are incredible and so different from what you'd ever find at a traditional Mexican restaurant. My favorite is made with sweet potato hot sauce ;) The margs are the best in town - jalepeno cilantro is a must try! Service could be a bit better, but the food tends to make up for it!"
2015-10-11,3.0,"New Paltz, NY",Abyssinia Ethiopian Restaurant,"We try to go to any Ethiopian restaurant we can in our travels. Still heartbroken that Makeda in New Brunswick NJ closed. This one is very good!  Not as many vegetarian choices as at other places, but the Miser Wat is TERRIFIC. Little bit spicy, but berbere sauce is such a unique and wonderful flavor. They also had a juice I've never had before - combo of mango, orange, and cranberry - very interesting (good interesting, not bad interesting)!  Service was very good.  Warning: your GPS will tell you to turn left - it's the second left, behind the stores at the first left!"

It was a great experience of flavors, drinks and very good service. We had Katrina as our server and she was very kind and sweet.  We had strawberry and basil mojitos (excellent) lasagna and chicken Limone  (great) and also Calamari as an entrée. I super recommend this place, specially this week with such a great weather to enjoy the patio!"

I had the Brisket Reuben that came in marble rye, packed with brisket, ham, collard greens (COLLARD GREENS IN THE SANDWICH), Russian dressing and some yummy Swiss. It definitely was one of the messier sandwiches I have had, but also one of the best!Our server Austin was fantastic. He left us alone for the most part but came over to make sure our meals were delicious. Also, I happened to be extra thirsty on this day and was drinking Diet Pepsi. Every time my glass was almost empty, Austin walked over with another. He provided excellent customer service. I won't be forgetting this little gem in Cameron Village again. :)"
2015-10-11,5.0,"Durham, NC",Barry’s Cafe,"Great place for a weekday lunch! My coworkers like to order breakfast food (eg. omelettes) for lunch here. It was already pretty crowded when we got there around 12pm so our waitress seemed kind of rushed when we requested certain things like straws for our cups. I ordered the Reuben sandwich ($9.49) which comes with a side: chips, coleslaw, or applesauce. I opted for coleslaw, which went well with my sandwich. My Reuben was chock full of thick corned beef slices, swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and dressing on rye bread. Yum!! The portion size was huge and I saved 1/3 of it for dinner later.Every meal comes with a free just-baked cookie, which I almost declined until my friends kindly informed me that the cookie is FREE, why would you not accept it?!"
2015-10-11,2.0,"Wilmington, NC",Ole Time Barbecue,"Ole Time has the best eastern NC BBQ in the triangle. The vinegar based pulled pork is slow cooked, the collards and green beans are perfect, and the hush puppies come out piping hot! We order ole time for a lot of football games and their tailgate packages are definitely the way to go for an easy meal."
2015-10-11,5.0,"Wilmington, NC",The Oak,"We went for Sunday brunch today and were very disappointed. It took 20 minutes for our server to come and greet us or take our order. I ordered a salad with grilled chicken and Bloody Mary, and my fiancé the breakfast burrito. About 10 minutes later the waitress returned to let me know they couldn't put any protein on the salad, so I switched the order to a burger. When the food came out, I had yet to receive the Bloody Mary and the waitress didn't seem to care that she had forgotten about it. The food was average, but the service really turned us off from returning to the restaurant. There are dozens of other much better places in the triangle for Sunday brunch."
2015-10-11,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Oak,"Went for Sunday brunch to use our Groupon. Thankfully it was a gorgeous day so we were able to sit outside. The food was really good. I had the Hangover Sandwich and Mrs. B had the breakfast burrito. We both got coffee which was good, but nothing amazing.Service was friendly, but a little slow. I think it was just our server, though. She seemed to be having an off day or something.Will try and go back for dinner sometime. Looks like it would be good for a date night restaurant."
2015-10-11,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Shuckers Oyster Bar & Grill,"My mom and I came here for a late lunch and we were pleasantly surprised with the amazing food, service and reasonable prices. We sat on the patio to enjoy a beautiful fall day. My review is mainly on the oysters because we had them baked, fried, and on the half shell. Although I can't wait to try the grouper bites. Our server Shannon was great. She was very personable and attentive without being overbearing. She even brought a piece of complimentary key lime pie that was amazing. It was obviously home made and better than any I've had. Even in key west. Will definitely be back for happy hour when they have 75 cent oysters!"

After the terrible experience my wife and I had during our 1st visit at First Watch Glenwood Ave NC  on September 27, 2015, I made up in my mind I was NEVER going back! But, Joe S. who is over the two Raleigh, NC stores had other plans! I placed the previous review on Yelp as well as the company Facebook page. Joe replied within 10 minutes of my post on the Facebook page and apologized. He gave me his phone number and asked me to call him to discuss my issues.  VERY unexpected! If anything I expected a light apology, followed by a bunch of deflective words! When I called Joe he was very sincere in his apology! He wanted us to give the restaurant another chance, on him! I reiterated to Joe we were not going back, but I really did appreciate him. He insisted we give his restaurant another chance.....but not in a pushy way, nor in a begging way, but in a confident reassuring way!  So I took him up on his offer. My wife and I went back to the same location today..........and WHAT A BIG DIFFERENCE!!!! We did not speak to anyone about our last visit, so as to not give any hints that they'd better gei it right this time. We wanted the experience to be natural,  normal, and real. My wife and I arrived there a little after 12pm today. The hostess had a SMILE and seemed happy to seat us! The table and chairs were clean, and our waitress Lindsey was ON POINT! She greeted us with sincerity and a smile, like she was happy to take our order! She was pleasant, knowledgeable of the menu, and courteous!  She was not pushy and did not show a lack of concern when my wife told her the waffle was cold!! She went and brought a new hot waffle in no less than 5 minutes!In closing...the restaurant today October 11th, was just as busy as it was on September 27th. The difference was the SINCERE SERVICE,  and WILLINGNESS TO CORRECT ANY ISSUE BEING REAL WITH IT! At the end of our meal the manager Sarah came over to ensure everything was good, and this is before she knew we had a previous issue! Sarah even helped clear our table!!! This visit from beginning to end, and all in the middle was excellent and positive!! We shall definitely continue our patronage!!!!!"

2015-10-11,3.0,"Burlington, NC",Sawasdee Thai Restaurant & Bar,Pad Thai chicken is good. I've had better but I get it every restaurants has their own recipe and way of cooking and Yaa I like it it wasnt on point but still good and didn't have to wait long. Their restroom is dirty and smells so bad I almost threw up.
2015-10-11,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bida Manda,"The soup. Trust me, get the soup. So good. Came to Bida Manda for a work meeting and experienced great service, a very cool atmosphere and the best soup I have ever had (the Crispy Pork Belly soup!). For the price the portion was HUGE, so much so that I still had 3/4 of the bowl when I had to bow out. The veggies were fresh and the spice level wasn't too bad for a weakling like me. The only (tiny) gripe I had was the actual pork belly in the soup was pretty hard and surprised me when I bit down on it. It kind of reminded me of fat back rather than actual pork belly. I know the dish states 'crispy pork belly' but it was more like crunchy. But despite this the soup, and Bida Manda as a whole, was still pretty amazing!"
2015-10-11,4.0,"Cary, NC",Tupelo Honey Cafe Raleigh,"First and foremost - service is 11 out of 10.  My waitress - britt or bryn or something - phenomenal - girl was on it!  Food tasted like it fell from heaven and then god himself shit on it.  The cook (Nichole?) was so busy but still took time to personally make sure it was to standard. - when she asked if we like it I replied "" I don't like it- I LOVE IT.""  If this is not your go to restaurant in Raleigh - you're just wrong .  Thanks guys!!"
2015-10-11,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Lynnwood Grill & Brewing Concern,"Food is pretty good, but we have been three times now and each time service is very slow. When we sit down it always takes 5-10 minutes before someone comes over to get our drink order then another 5 or so until we get our drinks, so you can imagine how long it takes to get our food. I will say all our waitresses have been very nice just unfortunately slow."
2015-10-11,5.0,"Seattle, WA",Death & Taxes,"I really wanted to like this place more. The name is fantastic and the ambience and style is appealing, with a rustic hipster flare. First off, the cocktails were amazing (I recommend the Cerberus Maximus). The food however didn't quite work for me. Everything sounded great on the menu but the flavor combo didn't quite work on most of the dishes, particularly the foraged mushrooms, short rib and the eggplant dishes. However, the pound cake dessert is not to be missed. Otherwise, skip Death and Taxes for the entree and try one of the other AC restaurants, e.g., Poole's or Joule."
2015-10-11,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chuck’s,"Love this place. Small room, good selection of beers and sodas, and the great service you always get at an A. Christensen restaurant. Be warned, the burgers are reasonably sized (there is an option to order a double patty). If you are looking for BEEF VOLUME you should probably head to Hardee's. Can't wait to get back. My full review, with pics is at bonvagrant.com/#/chucks-…"
2015-10-11,5.0,"Norfolk, VA",David’s Dumpling & Noodle Bar,The food here was delicious!  My wife and I had the half cooked dumplings for an appetizer and then both had the roast pork and dumpling ramen soup for dinner. Both were cooked perfectly and had me reminiscing over some of the noodle shops I've visited in Hong Kong and China.  Authentic!
2015-10-11,2.0,"Orlando, FL",Piola,"Good bar service. Nice prices. Pizza is boring.  Crust is soggy. Sauce is bland. Sauce tastes like out of a store bought can. Sausage was okay. Good for bar drinks. Not sure I would eat here again. Wasn't horrible, but (even though I hate them) chain pizzas are just as good for less"
2015-10-11,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Driftwood Southern Kitchen,"We have been here a few times for the Sunday brunch which seems to have steadily gone downhill.  We decided to try our luck with dinner, hoping for a better experience than the buffet style brunch.We had the DW STYLE CHICKEN FRIED CHICKEN with mashed potatoes and sausage gravy.  This was pretty good. The chicken was decently cooked, but the sausage gravy was a bit odd for my taste.We also had the BRISKET PHILLY CHEESESTEAK.  The odd cheddar sauce on a fatty, dried out brisket was unappealing.Apparently the single serve experience is no better than the buffet style.  We will not be back."
2015-10-11,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",David’s Dumpling & Noodle Bar,Service was on point. Chx pad thai is delicious!!! My boyfriend pho and said it was one of his top favorites. We will definitely be back next time we are craving Thai!

My boyfriend and I are pescetarian so we were worried that we wouldn't have too many options but that was not the case. With most of the entrees you are able to sub out shrimp or tofu for the meat. When we sat down we were immediately greeted and given water. A little later we received two little cups of complimentary carrot ginger soup, which was delicious. Ordered the Vietnamese fried veggie spring rolls, which were rolled so tightly and were very good. For my entree I got the garlic eggplant with shrimp, which also comes with snow peas and bell pepper. The sauce was very tasty. My boyfriend got lo mein noodles with shrimp, which had a nice, smoky, savory flavor. Got dessert as well: flourless chocolate cake for him, and poached Asian pear with ginger ice cream for me. All delicious and prepared with care. Waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and attentive without being pushy. Bathrooms were also fairly clean. Overall I highly recommend this lovely restaurant!"

I've been there a few times now and have the ordered tacos, burritos and quesadillas. I haven't been disappointed yet! All meals come with chips and salsa, and the guacamole is definitely worth ordering as well. They have corn hole and outdoor seating to enjoy during the summer months. Its great for large groups and the wait staff have always been wonderful."

2015-10-11,3.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Rye Bar & Southern Kitchen,"My wife and I made a last minute decision to go to a performance at Memorial Hall last night. We arrived at Memorial Hall without tickets and 10 minutes before the box office opened; slightly more than an hour before the performance. Not knowing what to do about dinner we took a short walk up Fayetteville St. and stopped in to the Rye Bar and Southern Kitchen to look at the menu. The Exec. Chef and GM of the restaurant, Michael Rigot, happened to be at the hostess station. We explained our time dilemma to which he responded ""place your order with me, go for your tickets and dinner will be waiting for you when you return."" It was perfect. The best pulled pork sandwiches we ever tasted along with a fabulous side salad. A great dinner, great service (my water glass was never left empty even though there was a bottle of water on the table for us to pour from), nice wine and beer selection and we arrived back at Memorial Hall in time for the performance. Looking around as we walked to and from our table we could see that there were many delicious looking meals being served to a full house of patrons. This we be our restaurant of choice before Raleigh performances from here on. Thank you Michael for making the evening a success."
2015-10-12,3.5,"Cary, NC",Chow Pizza Bar,"CHOW is a good spot to catch the game and grab a cold beer. Went here on a Sunday night and it was decently packed. The food was actually really good, we got a salad (they also kindly split in half for my mom and I to share) and a 10 inch pizza. It made me mad that I ordered pizza last week from a chain delivery spot last week and paid $15 for a mediocre pizza now knowing I can get a gourmet style pizza for less than that!The draft beer selection was also nice and I liked the option that I could get a 10oz beer versus a full beer (just because I am lame and didn't feel like drinking a full pint of beer that night!) =)Lastly, the service was overall really nice for a regular bar spot. Seems like the team really cares about their food and service - keep it up!"
2015-10-12,5.0,"Cary, NC",Manhattan Cafe,"My first visit and overall was tasty - I definitely want to go back to try the variety of options they have. Reminds me of an upscale version of a cafe I went to right inside Times Square in NYC that had a ton of options for whatever you're craving at the moment. I got the thai chicken wrap which was very flavorful, was kind of disappointed that it was a cold wrap but that is just a personal preference. For less than $7, I got a half wrap and soup, which for lunch is amazing downtown. The menu was huge and had options of pitas, hot and cold sandwiches, wraps, quesadillas, a pasta bar, breakfast sandwiches, and don't discount the salad bar - looking forward to experiencing this monster on my next visit as they had a TON of topping options!"
2015-10-12,4.0,"Warminster, PA",Mura,"Fast and pleasant service from the hostesses and nice flavors lose points to warm sushi in my take out. I got the chicken dumplings and 919 roll (no cucumber, sub avocado) as a take-out order. It was ready in 10 minutes, and the hostess was very sweet when I picked it up. She even  double checked to see if there were any extra sauces I wanted, which of course there were. Although I didn't stay, I did notice how adorable the outside seating area was, so intend to dine-in sometime in the future. The chicken gyoza were crisped to perfection. The chicken filling was oddly compacted, however, which made for a hearty but somewhat dry dumpling. The mustard dipping sauce was divine. As for the sushi roll, I have had better. The flavors were all great -  tempura shrimp, spicy tuna and basil mayo blended well. But the roll was inexplicably warm. As confident as I was that the roll was fresh, the warmth was off-putting for sure. Not a big enough set-back to keep me from trying it again, but enough for me to insist that it earns the forth star another time."
2015-10-12,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Hayes Barton Café & Dessertery,"So I've only been here twice: once when I first moved to Raleigh and once a few days ago.  Had dessert only both times.  It blew me away both times.  This last time my Sweets and I shared a GINORMOUS slice of the peanut butter pie/cake....whatever it is.  It was so amazingly rich and wonderful and decadent.  We had already eaten dinner, so we couldn't finish it (which is a miracle, because both of us do have a sweet tooth.)  We took it ""to go"", but we ended up sitting on a bench outside to devour it, before heading over to a movie at the Rialto.  Great spot.  Can't wait to come back.  There were about 16 other desserts on display that were described to us that all made my mouth water.  Some sort of raspberry truffle thing, a black forest cake, a pumpkin cheesecake, something with hazelnut, and like a million other things.  Why don't I go here more often is the only question I am left pondering.The decor is very retro.  It kind of reminds you of a smaller version of Sardis or Carmines in NYC.  It is bustling, crowded, and loud, but all that just adds to the ambiance. Walls are littered with old photos. Floors are probably black & white checkered (although I'm not entirely sure on this particular detail....it just seems like it would be that way). Servers are running around, without taking a break to breath.   I was grateful to have been able to sit outside on a beautiful early autumn evening and stuff that beautiful dessert into my face."
2015-10-12,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",La Carreta Mexican Restaurant,"Muy sabroso!!!! :) Went during the late half of lunch on a Monday. Restaurant was clean and smelled clean (a rarity anymore). Very kind and friendly service. Both of us went with dishes that we typically order in any Mexican restaurant as a benchmark and boy were we blown away. Particularly my burrito (I got the Burrito San Jose) was delicious. Pricing is a little higher than your average Mexican restaurant, however the atmosphere, service, and food were worth the extra couple dollars. Oh, the queso? Much better than most!"
2015-10-12,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Hayes Barton Café & Dessertery,"Keep in mind this review is going to warrant an update once I've had the pleasure of experiencing something other than the phenomenal desserts Hayes Barton offers. This place is a cute, quirky little diner by day and a more formal sit-down situation at night. The building was quite obviously an old pharmacy, set up with the same little horseshoe bar in the center of the floor and surrounded by other little 2-top tables around the perimeter. They've maintained the old-school charm of the pharmacy with their 1940's décor and ambience. Let me just paint a picture for you about how generous their portions of cake are: myself and one other person ate one slice of cake for 3 consecutive nights. The friendly woman behind the counter can always fire off each flavor of the dozen-or-so cakes in the case by memory, and they're ever-changing. This place is pretty popular and you can't really sit and eat your dessert after dusk because the tables/barstools are reserved for dinner guests only (we got politely but assertively pushed out of our window seats around 7:00 one time after we'd overstayed our welcome apparently), so be prepared to grab and go if you're only planning on enjoying the dessert."
2015-10-12,3.0,"Morrisville, NC",The Oak,"We went for the Sunday Brunch and were served by Alex. She was friendly, attentive and made the experience enjoyable. What was very nice was that they all work as a team, so we never ran out of coffee and never had to wait for anything. We had a pretty basic breakfast which was made to perfection. Eggs done exactly as ordered, home fries that were not over seasoned and gouda grits that will keep us coming back.We also had a very nice conversation with the other Alex. She is the GM and is very good at it. We hope the owners know about the gems they have."

Pasta was way over cooked. Mind you, I'm a server so I am pretty tolerant of a lot of things. Definitely won't be coming back.Make sure you don't get Cynthia !!!"
2015-10-12,4.0,"Fishers, IN",Garland,"We picked Garland for two reasons, 1) I found it thanks to Yelp, 2) when I told my fiancée she said a coworker had suggested it as well. So here we were most determined to go there for dinner. We arrived and were welcomed by the sweetest host, Germaine (if I recall correctly). We got set up at the bar where complimentary glasses of Champagne were waiting for us to cheer for my birthday! All the bartenders were as kind as it gets making sure we had all we needed without being intrusive. Adam, one of the bartenders, told us about the club they have downstairs and the concert room upstairs. Our food was simply spectacular, I will add photos as soon as I'm done here. I had the noodles and beef broth which was awesome and very filling. My fiancée had the veg curry which was so delicious, I was a bit jealous though mine was still the bomb. Lol. Our grind had the lamb sausage which was so fresh it was a sin! After dinner we stepped outside to head to the downstairs club when Paul, the owner, came out to say hello and thank us for coming to dinner. Paul was, as you would expect by now, extremely nice and thankful that we had come. He shared with us the story of his establishment and was just a delight to chat with. Long story ""short"" we had an amazing time dining at Garland and the most fun dancing all night downstairs, where our host was then DJing!!! What an amazing team of people! Paul, we thank you for a memorable night and will have to come again next time we end up in Raleigh. I highly recommend this place Yelpers!!!"
2015-10-12,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bahama Breeze,"Never,Never Never will return! This is by far the worst food ever. Just a few years ago it was the best. I returned not one but 2 dishes because lack of flavor and over cooked. First I ordered the steak OMG no salt no nothing, asked to be cooked medium it was well done. Next I tried Salmon, yuck same thing no salt no nothing but a pile of pineapples on top that was cold!! Salmon was breaking apart as it came to the table it was so overcooked! The empanadas were not crispy,the dough was raw!! The only thing tasty was the rice I guess because it is pre made! Will not return!"

Try not to share this with too many people though - we don't want him getting so busy he doesn't have time for us!"
2015-10-12,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Death & Taxes,"I love everything AC makes so no surprise that I gave her newest venture 5 stars.We went for my boyfriend's birthday and booked ahead online - a tip I recommend to everyone to do just in case. We were seated quickly and at a beautiful sunny table near the window with a full view of the restaurant that was clearly thoughtfully designed.We ordered drinks from their carefully crafted cocktail menu - him the Prophet & Loss and for me the Dearly Departed and him (later on) the Rye Cobbler. All were amazing, standard sizes portions of well mixed drinks. Not too boozy, but not too sweet.For dinner we ordered the potatoes aligot, the bone marrow (a first for both of us), and the roasted oysters. The potatoes aligot was a divine mix of my two favorite things, potatoes and cheese, blended to perfection and served in a little black pot. A full serving was more than enough for the two of us.While we finished all of our roasted oysters and did enjoy them, we weren't blown away by them and would have much preferred our usual down the road at 42nd Street. Will definitely order something in it's place next time.The bone marrow was our shot in the dark, something we've never had but always wanted - this dish had a lot of expectations to live up to and it delivered. As soon as we scooped this decadent, dreamy, rich bone marrow right from the bone onto perfectly crisp bread we knew we had made the right decision. Definitely a must have on the menu.Since it was a birthday celebration (and since they have an amazing pastry chef), we ended the night with their malted chocolate chess pie. A small serving, but plenty for two after a delicious meal.I will admit that the portions are small and priced higher than other AC restaurants; however, it was all well worth the trip. I found myself slowing down to savor the food and the experience and am grateful for the reminder to take in the moment.Other notes: Our server Daniel is the best there is - definitely request him if it's your first time there. He is patient and attentive and everything a good waiter should be.The plates and other dinnerware are handmade by a local artist as is most of the work in the building. Please take time to look around you and see this amazing artistry and craftsmanship.We went on a tour of the building before it was complete through an event hosted by The Raleigh Historic Development Commission. If you ever have time to read about this building and the time and effort that was put into bringing it back to it's original glory, I highly recommend it. It also has a killer (no pun intended) backstory as alluded by it's name."
2015-10-12,5.0,"Apex, NC",Gravy,"I've wanted to check this place out since I first heard the name. Having grown up next door to my Italian grandmother in a heavily Italian area, this word and food was part of our everyday language. And having spent the last year focused on old world Italian cooking, I'm always looking for inspiration. I finally made it over today. We started with the risotto balls. The presentation was fantastic. They have a nice crunch and the gravy is like my grandmother's.  But the risotto was overcooked and soft. They're pricey but worth a try.My wife and I split the chicken parm sandwich and the tagliatelle bolognese. The bread for the sandwich was nice but overpowered the uninspiring chicken cutlet. The tagliatelle was pretty good but a little soft and given the serving size and minimal meat, just not worth the price. I wouldn't order either again.The atmosphere was great and the service was good. But I thought the food was way overpriced for what it is. I think this place is great for the area and worth a try but it would be hard to justify much beyond that."
2015-10-12,3.0,"Morganton, NC",Gravy,"I had a fantastic meal. I reviewed the menu online, but it didn't strike me how truly pasta oriented this restaurant was until I arrived. I do not believe I've ever been to any Italian restaurant that didn't have a single menu item without pasta...until now. It's very difficult to eat a diabetic diet at Gravy. With that said, what I did order, with Gluten Free pasta, was amazing! I also had a Kale salad that was out of this world! My server was top notch, and cute to boot!  Overall great experience!"
2015-10-12,5.0,"Durham, NC",Seoul Garden Restaurant,Definitely enjoyed eating here and would definitely come back.
2015-10-13,3.0,"Alexandria, VA",El Pollo Rico Restaurant,If you want some reall pupusas or enchiladas or sopes or whatever i would really recommend this places. They literally make it out of scratch and it comes out tasting THEEE BOOMMBB!! Growing up with hispanic food made it hard for a restaurant to replace it but this place made it!!!! Lol.
2015-10-13,5.0,"Lowell, MA",Mellow Mushroom,Have been here a few times and always excellent service! Especially today with Steve. Good food & great location. Definitely recommend.
2015-10-13,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kabab and Curry,"Tried the buffet for lunch, and while it was good for a buffet, they really dumbed down on the spicy dishes.  Which is a disappointment for me, and one reason I did not intend to get the buffet.  The chicken tandoori was outstanding.   Service was sparse.That said, we wanted to order off the menu (I had a Groupon).   We were told that during lunch they do not offer the menu, only the buffet.  And they refused to accept the Groupon because it excludes the lunch buffet.  That's fine, but the Groupon should have read ""good only during dinner.""  Groupon refunded my money (thank you Groupon), but the restaurant really didn't handle this well at all."
2015-10-13,4.0,"Southampton, NY",Donatos Raleigh,Just in town and looking for a quick bite.  Service and my pizza were both good.  I'd do it again!
2015-10-13,5.0,"Charlotte, NC",18 Seaboard,"Good ambiance. Service was strong. I ordered a trout that was not fresh, perhaps frozen and defrosted, served with some squash/zucchini for sides. It was 'okay' but nothing to rave about. I would give this place another shot."
2015-10-13,5.0,"University, NC",Gringo A Go-Go,"This place is amazing! Five stars all the way. The el pastor taco is my favorite, with the asada and chorizo tacos tying for second. No, the tacos are not loaded with cheese and sour cream, which is why I like them so much. They come with cilantro and onions (in a soft corn tortilla) and you can order the condiment plate if you like more toppings. The thick chips and guacamole are the best in Raleigh and the burrito is huge- like a small baby! It might not be the cheapest restaurant, but if you are looking for cheap Mexican this is not the place for you. Oh and try the drinks! The margaritas are great!! I would eat here everyday if I could."
2015-10-13,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gringo A Go-Go,Great little spot! Nice patio area to sit outside (a bit loud from the traffic because you are very close to the main road). Definitely some of the best authentic Mexican food in Raleigh. The flavors and presentation are what sets it apart I think. I've been really trying to find decent Mexican food in the area and I've found it. It's worth checking out.
2015-10-13,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tasty 8’s,"Tasty 8s has a great concept- delicious gourmet hot dogs, good (local) craft beer, and a great atmosphere.... and they're open late on weekends for late night munchies! Located at the intersection of Fayetteville & Hargett St in downtown Raleigh, their takeout window makes it quite easy to snag a dog on the way to a meeting (or a bar if its late). My favorite dog is the El Perro, an all-beef dog topped with queso, guac, & chipotle crema. I usually get the combo with a drink and sweet potato fries. The combo is $9.88 (recently raised prices by $1) which is a pretty good deal for the good ingredients in this meal! A second favorite is the bahn mi chicken dog. They usually have like 8 regulars plus one special dog of the month. I love all the sauces they have to choose from for your fries!For a different experience, scrumptious gourmet hot dogs, and a good selection of local craft beer, find your way over to Tasty 8's for a great meal :)"
2015-10-13,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Calavera Empanadas And Tequila,"This place is very unique and the staff is very nice. I love the art work and the different Margarita options, as well as the empanadas. They are perfect and not over cooked. I'm looking forward to coming back again."
2015-10-13,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sawasdee Thai Restaurant & Bar,"The four stars is just for the food. The food is absolutely amazing. From sushi to ramen. Everything tasted great. However if I can give stars for service, I would give it a ONE star. No one smiles or greats you. They just take your food and drops it off. Then they go back in the kitchen for a long stints of time. I waited for my check one time for 15 mins. There were only three other guests there. Every time I come here, I think I'm bothering someone. From carry out to dine in, they don't care. Good thing to food is great."
2015-10-13,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Remedy Diner,This place reminds me of some great places in Chicago. Very Veg-friendly. Staff has always been cool. Remedy is truly one of my favorite places.
2015-10-13,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tupelo Honey Cafe Raleigh,"This place is awesome. I went for brunch and lunch, and wasn't disappointed either times. I will say, you need to make reservations or you will be waiting a long time. We forgot to make reservations and had to wait 2 and half hours."
2015-10-13,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kai Sushi and Sake Bar,"I love sushi and am always looking for a good spot. I came here during the week with my boss for a working lunch. It's hard to find the place, I did pass by it once because it's hidden in the shopping center.The lunch menu has a section where you can do combination of 2 rolls. They do not have BOGO which always makes me sad. However I got 2 rolls the piano roll and the Shrimp Tempura for $14.00. There was nothing that stood out to me about this place it was just decent sushi. I don't really plan on going back bcause it's not too close to my work place."
2015-10-13,4.0,"Holly Springs, NC",Seoul Garden Restaurant,"Hands down the best Korean food in the Triangle area.  I have never had anything here that I didn't like!  The selection of banchan is always good, and you can't go wrong with a bowl of bimimbap covered with their awesome hot/sweet sauce!!  The prices aren't bad, maybe some of the entrees are a bit pricey, but it's all very fresh and top quality here, so it's worth it!"

If you are looking for a quick pizza place without the spending an arm and a leg for toppings, this is your place to go."
2015-10-13,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Relish Café & Bar,"Disappointing shrimp burger.  No burger but 7 shrimp that fell of when you go to take a bite, one all the way to the floor had to empty the remaining to the plate and eat with a fork and bite the empty bun, Flavor was ok but it is much better when made with the same amount of shrimp but ground and made into a patty  with additional caramelized onions. Not here, their lack of ingenuity made me give 3 stars"
2015-10-14,5.0,"Columbia, SC",Humble Pie,"My friends and I really just stumbled upon this place and I'm happy we did! We ordered a cheese plate, scallops, Bibb salad, pork belly sliders, brussel sprouts and gnocchi. This is a tapas restaurant so we had to try a little bit of everything!  Everything we ate was very flavorful and well presented. My favorites were the brussel sprouts which they toss in a vinegary sauce and the gnocchi. The cheese plate we ordered was a very generous portion size. It was also happily, half price wine night so it was a definite win!"
2015-10-14,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Devolve Moto,"Stop the presses, Yelpers! Just when you thought the old coffee/bar model had been done to death, Devolve Moto changed the game with their vintage West Coast themed Motorcycle/Outfitter/Espresso/Craft Beer shop. And it's as awesome as it sounds.The atmosphere is familiar enough, but Devolve's flavor is one of a kind and an edgy addition to a neighborhood that could use it. I have love for Glenwood, I do. But if they put another wine bar, salon, or boutique up in this piece, I fear we'll all turn some shade of Vera Bradley paisley a la Violet Beauregard. Thankfully, Devolve is shaking things up with a little something for everyone - impeccable espresso drinks (one of the first in town to use locally roasted Torch espresso beans), homegrown grub from Lucette Grace and Taco Revolution, a fine selection of craft brews, and one beautifully merchandised motor lifestyle boutique. The gift item curation is phenomenal (family - you know where Christmas is coming from this year...).The staff is welcoming and down to earth, and the ambiance is warm and cozy and perfectly rough around the edges. The storefront boasts two garage doors that open up to keep the space light and airy on nice days. Loving everything about this new addition to the neighborhood. Go check em out!"
2015-10-14,5.0,"Charlotte, NC",18 Seaboard,Five stars across the board.  From service to food to the atmosphere. This place is amazing.I was visiting Raleigh for work and this place was highly rated on Yelp. And deservingly so. Tucked away in the back of Seaboard Station it's almost like a secret entrance.  Though they kindly have put up signs leading the way.  My meal started with a complimentary amuse bouche which tonight was their mushroom soup topped with bacon. It was the perfect bite. I didn't know mushroom soup could be that good. I was trying to eat healthy and this place made it easy. I ordered the Salmon with two different veggies as my side.  The salmon was amazing. You could definitely taste that it was cooked over firewood. It was crispy on the outside and tender/perfectly medium on the inside.  I chose the tarragon butter for my sauce which paired perfectly with the salmon.  I know not so healthy but worth every calorie. The spinach was surprisingly flavorful and I almost wish I had ordered it for both of my sides.Not only was the food amazing but the service was just as great. The bartender had a way to make you feel like you were the only person she was waiting on even though the bar was almost full. She new exactly when I was ready to order and everything was perfectly timed.I'm already looking forward to my next visit to Raleigh just so I can go back!
2015-10-14,5.0,"Carthage, NC",The Mecca Restaurant,"I've seen this place in downtown for years, but I always thought it was a Middle Eastern Restaurant. It's not. It's basic Southern food, cooked very well. The fried chicken was fantastic. The service was quick and friendly. They pour an honest cocktail for a decent price. The decor is old and a bit dive-y, but that just adds to the atmosphere. It's clean and comfortable. I'll definitely go back."
2015-10-14,2.0,"Winston-Salem, NC",Tasty 8’s,"Tasty 8's was stop two on my Hot Dog Odyssey to the Triangle.  I spent a lot of time in Raleigh a few years ago and it was nice to come back and see this new addition to Fayetteville St.I love the big roll-up garage doors that open on to the street.  The restaurant itself is fairly small but didn't feel cramped during my visit.There were lots of tasty and uncommon hot dogs available but I chose to try out Tasty 8's version of the classic Carolina Dog which they call the ""Southern Comfort.""  The dog was good.  The chili that comes on it is not what I would consider traditional hot dog chili as it had beans in it.  I didn't taste much of the blue cheese in the blue cheese slaw, either.  However, the hot dog was still tasty.The fries were very good and earned the fourth start for Tasty 8's.  I chose the Bacon Aioli for my dipping sauce and it was a gluttonous treat.Nice work Tasty 8's."
2015-10-14,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Capital Club 16,"First of all - the name confuses me. I get Capital Club 16, City Club, and the grand ballroom on the 12th floor of the Capital Club Building confused with each other. Too many capital city club things! I have been to Capital Club 16 (ah, yes! the restaurant!) twice now. On my first visit, I remember that I ordered the Portobello Grilled Cheese and just felt a bit underwhelmed by my the whole experience. It took me awhile to come back but I went back for dinner recently during SPARKcon. I sat outside and had the Pimento Cheese and Fig Crostinis and the Austrian Steak and Fries. The crostinis were amazing and the steak and fries were just alright. Our server was attentive and nice enough, but definitely had a hipster vibe about her.Don't get me wrong! It's a cute, trendy place with a great location but I just can't get into it more than an A-OK. I really wish I could do half stars, as I feel that my experiences have been 3.5 stars. I have to round down though because this really is not on the top of my list for recommendations of Downtown Raleigh restaurants. I have nothing against this place, I suppose that it just doesn't wow me. I haven't had their brunch, maybe that's where the wow factor is?"
2015-10-14,4.0,"Key West, FL",Neomonde Bakery & Deli,"Love this little spot! The food is fresh and authentic, it's like a guilty pleasure but healthy! I've been going to neomondes for a long time and it keeps getting better! Part of me wishes this would stay a secret, but I am glad it is growing and becoming ever more popular! This is one of my favorite lunch catch up spots for meeting friends, the outside patio is lovely. The only slight con is that it is a bit overpriced, especially as a college student, but I justify it as a ""treat yourself"" kind of place.It is so much better than Jasmine's!!"
2015-10-14,5.0,"San Diego, CA",Mi Cancun,We stopped into Mi Cancun twice now since it opened last month.  I had the Burrito/Enchilada combo and the wife had the California Burrito.  Both were excellent and she had way enough for her cherished leftovers.  She is not a drinker normally but when she saw them squeezing fresh limes for each Cadillac Margarita she had to try one.  Excellent also.  The next time in I had the ChoriPollo Burrito.  It was a tasty combination of Chorizo and Chicken stuffed into a flour tortilla with just the right amount of sauce on it.This is the best Mexican food I have had since moving to Raleigh from San Diego and the Happy Hour is the best I have found in Raleigh.   Check out the Daily Happy Hour specials on their website.  It is a little hard to find under Desserts and Specials.  Since I am a beer drinker I had the $1.99 Import Bottles on Monday night and the $4.99 Import 32 oz. drafts on our Friday stop.  The restaurant itself has great décor and was very clean right down to the restrooms.I have put Mi Cancun on my short list of places to eat and have a few drinks.

2015-10-14,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Relish Café & Bar,"Don't be fooled by the strip mall location/initial vibe! My boyfriend and I went here recently for brunch and we were blown away! Can't believe that it has taken me this long to eat here!When we arrived around 12pm on a Sunday, it was packed! The only available immediate seating was at the bar which I deemed ""too cold"" since the AC was pumping and I did not have a jacket with me. Rather than freeze at the bar, we decided to put our name on the waitlist. We were excited to see a pretty nice little gift shop which contained some local goodies and food samples. This definitely kept us entertained while we waited and before we knew it, our name was called for a table on the outdoor patio.The menus are incredible - both the main menu and the ""test kitchen"" menu! Everything looks delicious. My boyfriend ordered a cherry coke carolina ""shine"" and we decided on fried pimento cheese served with pepper jelly, fried avocado served with jalapeno ranch, and a buffalo chicken mac and cheese skillet to share. The pimento cheese was my favorite but everything was incredible. Definitely can't wait to come back here and try more items from the menus and shop around in the gift shop! I am also eager to bring my family back here when they are visiting town! I feel like it is a very family friendly option that they would enjoy."
2015-10-14,5.0,"Sanford, NC",Coquette Brasserie,"So good that I drove 40 minutes to eat here twice this week! Escargot, pate, mussels, everything was fantastic. Rivals the food we had in Paris. Great atmosphere. Ask for a table in the window to add to your experience"
2015-10-14,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Flying Burrito,"I heard about the Sunday Brunch on the radio, and took my family here when my daughter was home for fall break.  I thought there would be a crowd but there were only two other families there.  Should have been the tip off!The waitress was wonderful, the food was not so wonderful.  The pancakes with bacon cooked inside were probably the best item, and of course the least Mexican.  The quesadilla was enormous.  I had a burrito which was a pound of black beans, a fried egg, a big tortilla, and a sprinkling of cheese.  With salsa dumped on top.  That was it.  The beans had no seasoning of any kind, the egg was skimpy relative to the beans.  Similarly uninspiring was the huevos rancheros, the same unflavored mound of beans with an egg and some salsa dumped on top.If you're going to advertise Sunday brunch, serve Sunday brunch!"
2015-10-14,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Relish Café & Bar,Wonderful food that even my kids enjoyed. Love the Southern comfort food- and the variety. Affordable and we were seated in a decent amount of time.
2015-10-14,5.0,"Lexington, NC",The Fiction Kitchen,"Every time I come to a metropolitan area, I always look for a vegan restaurant. In NC, it is quite hard to find because in these parts, the cities are known for their barbecue and sweet tea. I found Fiction Kitchen and was delighted when I walked in. It's atmosphere is relaxed with progressive art on the walls and a very friendly, helpful, eclectic staff. We have been to Fiction Kitchen now on every single occasion we are in Raleigh, I make sure of it!The appetizers, entrees and desserts are all delicious, the combinations are unusual and delightful, our favorite entree being the chicken and waffles (chicken-free). It comes topped with arugula, fresh blueberries and a mint-infused agave syrup that is to die for. I find myself hovering over my plate like a caveman so my husband can't get his fork in there. I might have even growled at him. The first time I ate it, I had to stop and ask the waitress to be sure it wasn't actual chicken because the texture is so eerily close to the real thing, at least what I remember it to be. My husband, who is not vegan, said it is almost exactly like the real thing, just very tender. It's crispy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside with a superb flavor and the combination of the whole dish is definitely a party in your mouth!The only ONLY down side is, if it's busy, you're out of luck. There is limited seating and their hours are limited so once the table is gone, that's it for the night. Unless it's a short stay on the customers part and you walk in at just the right moment, which has happened. Your best bet is to get there as they open to ensure you get the best vegan grub in town. I got there 25 minutes early last time, and had 3 couples in front of me, so you know it's good!"
2015-10-15,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Manhattan Cafe,I always read a place 1 to 5 stars based off of The category that establishment is in. For a deli café this is five stars. My boyfriend eats here every day and I am here at least once a week. I've never seen anywhere else where you can get a salad made as large and nutritious as you can here. They have regular soups and sandwiches and a few that are just their specialties. Try the one with Brie. Love coming here. The only thing they could do for me is offer more comfortable stools at the front window. They are so high and there is nowhere for short people to rest their feet so my legs go to sleep. Ouch.
2015-10-15,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Red Pepper Asian,"I stopped in and got an order of the Chens chicken to go. It was closely comparable to general Tsaos chicken for me though and wasnt spicy or anything out of the ordinary. Its worth mentioning that their online ordering system is flawless though, it worked really well. Plenty of parking since its a strip mall and the prices were nothing crazy. Ill be going back again to try more stuff."
2015-10-15,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Hayes Barton Café & Dessertery,There is not a single more attentive restauranteur in Raleigh.  We wanted to take my boyfriend's parents here after moving into the neighborhood and joked that we should be there 30 minutes early to get a table. By accident we ended up there 20 minutes early and by god there was a line. Before opening. Some quick tips anything on the menu was great one slice of cake serves four. The owner is lovely and just a real treat to see each time.
2015-10-15,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",NOFO At the Pig,"This place used to take my brunch money every week. Because the menu doesn't really change I got burned out on my coastal Benedict, but it really preoccupied my thoughts for at least six months. ""when will the weekend be here? How long will the wait be? Can I time it right at 12 on Sunday to get a mimosa too?"" Yeah I had it bad. The place is really at the point where they should start taking reservations simply because of the length of wait on weekends. If you're prepared for a possible wait the upstairs gift shop is littered with free coffee and food samples to bide your time. Good luck getting bored up there. It's a veritable Wonderland."
2015-10-15,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Margaux’s Restaurant,"This is probably my favorite restaurant in Raleigh. My family and I have been going to this restaurant for years. When Margaux's opened 20 + years ago, Raleigh had very little fine dining.  We would go here for special occasions bc we we had few other choices. Today, with plenty of other choices, this is still my go-to spot!!The current chef is really fantastic and creates slightly varied menus on a daily basis. I can honestly say I haven't had a bad meal there and that, for a long time, I've had consistently excellent meals there. They often offer interesting meats, like wild game, that's always beautifully prepared with interesting flavor combinations. Also, I'm not usually a big bread eater, but theirs, especially the cornbread, is irresistible! Recently I took a friend there for the first time and couldn't have asked for a better meal and experience. My guests and I are always warmly greeted by the owner, Steve, who never fails to make you feel welcomed and attended to throughout our visit. He always stops over to check on things and takes the time to get to know his customers personally.  my friend and I shared the gyoza starter, which I always love. (Their French onion soup is outstanding also!) We then both ordered a venison with a fig compote, spinach and empanada type starch (the actual name is escaping me but it was wonderfully savory and delicious and made a fantastic flavor combination with the dish) that was out of this world! Perfectly cooked and just delicious! They always offer generous portions, so I typically box half my meal for lunch the next day. I don't typically get dessert bc it's so much food, but that night we got a caramel tart that was heavenly! All of this paired with a wonderful bottle of wine (they have an extensive wine list with many great selections) and great service (we were never unattended despite a packed house!) made for a perfect evening! I'm constantly suggesting this place to friends and have never taken someone there that hasn't loved it as. Much as I do! I never get tired of Margaux's (I'd probably eat there every night if I could!). Can't say enough good things about this restaurant! Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!!"
2015-10-15,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",MoJoe’s Burger Joint,You can't take away the wonderful upgrades this place has done to its patio or its location.  But I've never been impressed with the food. The burgers came off like they were frozen and I didn't care to finish my meal. It's a neat spot with a cool ambience but that's really where the benefits stopped for me. Meet friends here for drinks!
2015-10-15,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Garland,"Holy bibimbap. Which they call a pork bowl here, this is the real deal.  My boyfriend an avid athlete with a big appetite and I shared the cauliflower appetizer and the pork bowl successfully. Literally conniving a reason to go back at this moment. The only thing they could do better is controlling smokers outside. As we ate outside someone sat down at one of the nearby restaurant tables and lit up. This was a situation for a manager to come handle as no one enjoys smoke wafting over their dinner."
2015-10-15,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mami Nora’s,This is the hot joint to take people in from out of town on the cheap and impress. The smell pulls you in from a half-mile away. Chicken plantains and black beans are my go to. They also have a incredible comeback story after their main location burned down a few years ago. I always leave stuffed WITH extras.
2015-10-15,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kai Sushi and Sake Bar,"Hands down the best sushi town! In particular, their sashimi platter is amazing! It is without a doubt the freshest sashimi in Raleigh and the value is great. It's a huge platter with a good variety of fishes and never any off the crap fillers (like egg and shrimp) that the vast majority of other restaurants in the area provide. I've never had a roll there that I didn't think was fantastic. In fact, I brought a friend there the other night and we were saying how at other restaurants there's always at least one roll in the order that is just so so. While some of the other reviewers have commented on lack of bogo, they have 2 specials (1 for 3 rolls, and 1 for 5 rolls) that are very reasonable, and while I could be wrong on this, I don't think they have any rolls priced at $16.95 like many of the restaurants that offer bogo do. I also like the fact that they have a good selection of rolls that don't include tempura (one of the bogo places I used to go that has a HUGE) menu has almost no rolls without tempura). That said, I most often get the sashimi platter. They're appetizers are also tasty, my mom often orders a couple as her meal. The service is pleasant and all around I've always had great experiences here as has everyone I've taken!"
2015-10-15,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kimbap,"Great location good staff bad bibimBap. Other Korean places I've eaten made this dish and it knocked my socks off. Here not get halfway through it I didn't feel like taking it home. I used to live with a Korean friend and got turned onto it this way and while I don't know what this is missing it is something substantial. I personally judge all Korean restaurants on this one dish as it's my favorite. It's possible they have other things they do well, but for this particular dish I highly suggest Garland."
2015-10-15,5.0,"Hilliard, OH",Bida Manda,"We were visiting friends in Clayton NC and they decided we needed to give this restaurant a try.We had reservations, which we were told were hard to get, so we were seated straight away. The hostess was extremely friendly and took the time to answer our many questions and to also make a few drinks and menu recommendations. Drinks were ordered and all were fabulous. We ordered the Crispy Spring Rolls and the Chicken wings for appetizers and both were great. We really liked the side sauces included to both dishes, as they helped to embellish the tastes!For our entrees, I had the Green Papaya Salad, which was not really a salad, but much more. Mine came with slices of perfectly prepared Glazed Duck and it was possibly the best food on the table. My wife went for the Pad Thai, which she said was good but not quite spicy enough.Our friends had the Basil Stir-Fry and the Crispy Pork Belly Soup, both looked yummy, but were gone so fast that I did not get to taste them.We did not have dessert but our friends vowed to try it soon.The stay with our friends was wonderful, the food at this restaurant was great, so our over-all experience was very positive.Great work!"
2015-10-15,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Death & Taxes,"It took a month to get a reservation for a party of six, and it was well worth it. The place is lovely and the staff are professional and friendly. I'm a little bummed that they have not updated their menu online, so I'm going by a 5-day-old memory as to what was in the dishes I ordered. The back ribs were fantastic. Tender, tender beef in what I think was its own drippings. The beef was covered with a blanket of giant mushrooms (here is where the menu would have helped me--they are probably called something other than giant mushrooms). It was served with a side of creamy sunflower seeds? That is my best guess. What I know for sure is that it was delicious. I also ordered gourds with goat cheese and maybe pecans. I was surprised the dish was served cold, but it was tender and tasty, and with goat cheese who really cares if it's served warm or not? I did heat it the next day (yes, I had leftovers) and it was even better with the goat cheese all melty. For dessert I had pound cake with a scoop of purple ice cream (raspberry?) and a generous helping of whipped cream. There were shavings of something dry, white, and fluffy--possibly cheese. It was very good. The cake was more like coffee cake meets biscotti. It was dry and crisp on the outside, but cake-like on the inside, although not pound cake moist. Regardless, I ate every bit of it! The tab was steep, as expected, but I definitely recommend checking out AC's latest if you're into seriously good food or for a special occasion."
2015-10-15,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Busy Bee Cafe,"Busy Bee is the perfect place to pregame for the night. The beer on tap rotates daily, and selection of bottled fare is impressive.As for the menu, there aren't a ton of vegetarian options, but what they do have is fantastic. My go to is the Spinach Burger, which is made with feta, cucumbers and cherry tomatoes. Paired with their signature tater tots, you have yourself a pretty awesome meal.The service here has always been excellent. As long as you avoid their peak times on Friday and Saturdy nights, you'll have a great time."
2015-10-15,5.0,"Suwanee, GA",Stanbury,"Place was unbelievable. Had the lamb tongue,pig head, Beef tartare, pork chop, scallops and the tagliatelle. All were on point. They have it all figured out. Great job. We were in town for a conference and we are so glad we went. Hip atmosphere."
2015-10-15,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chuck’s,"Fun atmosphere, delicious burgers and fries are awesome.  Been here a few times now and I always have a blast.  Staff are attentive and personable, just like most places are unless you're a douche.  Parking garage right next to it so it's convenient parking as well."
2015-10-15,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Flying Burrito,My go to for fish tacos. Beware of the super spicy mayo the next day. While it's cute and the fish taco rocks my socks off I haven't found another taco on the menu I really love. The staff is OK though pretty blasé. This is the only reason it's missing a star.
2015-10-15,2.0,"Aberdeen, NC",The Flying Biscuit Café,"Great food with a fun twist.  It has a lot of the classic southern style foods (which they do well) and adds a fun tasty twist to them. Their staff is friendly and quick. I did find the dress of some to be rather odd.  Fitness tights at work, really? Your meal starts with some of the fluffiest biscuits I have ever had.  Will go again for sure."
2015-10-15,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kamado Grille,"It was clear that much effort and energy was put into the details of the restaurant atmosphere. Eating at Kamado Grille is unlike any other restaurant experience. With iPads on the table to order, screens to view the kitchen live-time, and a back patio ""feel"", the restaurant definitely has a unique concept. I only wish as much attention was paid to quality of the food. Here's what my table ordered: - Lamb appetizer - not sliced in equal sizes which left some pieces undercooked and some overcooked. Cold grits.- Crab cake appetizer - great flavor but over mixed with too much mayonnaise - Bone in pork chop - dry, overcooked, tough- Pork bomb - very tender, but over seasoned with cumin which made it difficult to eat- Salmon - perfectly cooked; grilled vegetables were under seasoned, overcooked, and watery- White chocolate bread pudding - deliciousOverall, the rub that is used on most of the meat (including the baked beans, lamb, pork bomb) was heavily seasoned with cumin. The flavor was overpowering and made some of the dishes undesirable for a person who is not the biggest fan of cumin. The music in the restaurant did not fit the atmosphere. On a Thursday night at 7PM, heavy metal music was loudly playing, making it extremely difficult to hold conversation. I understand this restaurant is fairly new. I would be willing to give this place another shot in the future once they have time to work out the kinks. It has potential, but right now, it's shooting below par."
2015-10-16,4.0,"Falls Church, VA",J Betski’s,Yum yum yum. I adore this place. The pork schnitzel is amazing. My hubby got the hanger steak and he loves the dish a lot. Oh the smoked kielbasa was delicious as well.
2015-10-16,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Serena Sicilian Influenced Cucina,"Amazing authentic Italian - flavorful and tasty, huge portions, great menu options, and good service. I also love that they bring you a taste of the soup of the day.  At least once, it has encouraged us to get a bowl of it! It had been a while since our last visit and I was pleased to see the quality and quantity of food is still great!"
2015-10-16,5.0,"Falls Church, VA",Sono,"Alright, I am going to be honest with you. I didn't have a high hope for this place as I ate at some very amazing Japanese restaurants but I was dead wrong about Sono. I came to this place two days in a row. That is how good this place is. First night: I ordered the spicy miso ramen and Mochi ice cream (mango and strawberry flavor).The flavor of the ramen was great. The egg was boiled perfectly, the charsu had a smokey flavor to it. It was different than a traditional Japanese ramen but hey, the combination turns out great. Second night: I ordered the ishiyaki bbq, the twisted mango roll and tonkotsu ramen. The ishiyaki was ok. Nothing special about it except it was being cooked in a hot stone. The twisted mango was one of the best roll I had in a long time. The  tonkotsu was great but it was a little strong for me.  Overall, it was a great place if you love Asian fusion food."
2015-10-16,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Capital Club 16,"Awesome customer service from Gregory the Wine Captain! Suggested earthy Domaine Charvin Rhone France...it has depth and is a deliciously smooth wine! The cheese board is phenomenal. It's different, it's plentiful and a perfect compliment to the Rhone wine. Paul our chief server is attentive and described everything. Can't believe I've missed this place but so very happy I've found it now.  Will definitely be back soon!"

The kitchen is so slooooowwwwww.. its insane.. i have been waiting for an hour for a sushi roll and a lo mein. U can't blame the wait staff, because they realize that their kitchen is super slow. Don't waste your time..GO SOME PLACE ELSE!!!!!!"
2015-10-16,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Death & Taxes,"Our waiter was great. Almost too thorough (read us basically the whole menu). But he was polite, attentive, and super friendly! We ordered wine, two small plates, and steak to share and our bill was $140 + tip. Comparatively, at Poole's, we receive better food, more food, and for less money. The restaurant is beautifully designed, neat atmosphere, the cocktails looked yummy, but we did not try. AC was there walking around, working in the kitchen, filling water glasses which is always nice to see from an owner/executive chef. The food is definitely different from all of her other restaurants. Very smokey flavor, which I usually enjoy, not a huge fan of it at D&T. I guess I like my expensive food to be flavored in other ways I suppose. Skip on the clams, wish I would have ordered the oysters instead after reading some other reviews. Sad to give this place a mediocre score, I was really expecting much more."

2015-10-16,5.0,"Durham, NC",Stanbury,"My husband unabashedly gnawed on our appetizer attempting to extract the last remaining bits of bone marrow. It was that good. Marrow seems to be the new pork belly... I've seen it trending on Instagram feeds and featured on a few local menus lately (including Death & Taxes and Primal). This was our first introduction, and it's safe to say we're fans. The marrow is quite rich, spoons out and spreads like butter over toasted bread. They give you two bones here, which means we each had a 'bone to pick' AND both of our dogs were able to enjoy the spoils afterward; thanks, Stanbury, for the literal doggie bag!Our other app, the ink octopus, was so incredible I don't have words to describe it. The surprising flavors and textures of both starters left us a wee bit disappointed with the entree we opted to split: a fish prepared Thai-style with rich coconut milk and jasmine rice. It was still tasty (featuring bright flavors and flakey fish), just not as standout or original as everything else we had. My cocktail was a light seasonal selection, subtle and refreshing. Place was packed and a little loud, but service (except for the hostess, a surprising anomaly) remained friendly and prompt. It's a fun off-beat space, a bit small & bustling, with oddities like Yoda decorations lurking about. Our check arrived with two squares of neighboring Escazu chocolate -- a super-cool (and tasty!) gesture to their neighbor. With the frequently updated seasonal selections ensuring a menu that remains full of surprises, this is one restaurant to put on heavy rotation."
2015-10-16,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Guasaca,"The first time I visited Guasaca I really didn't enjoy the arepas since I thought that the arepas were too hard and cripsy. I couldn't understand why this place has so many raving reviews. Boy, was I wrong!When I returned again to give it a second chance, I was very pleased with the food. Instead of ordering arepas, I got the shredded beef bowl. I was not aware that there is a 3-side limit to the bowl so I asked for more than 3. Even so, they did not stop me. My favorite side was definitely the plantain. It is a must have and would bring any bowl or arepa to a whole new level. I opted for the cilantro sauce and it was amazing too! The serving of the bowl was very generous and I had enough leftover for another meal."
2015-10-16,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Stanbury,"Love this place! Great food and cocktails, perfect for a fun date night. Everything we have ever tried has been great. Can't wait for our next visit.

2015-10-16,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sassool,"How could anyone not give this place five stars?  I'm a small eater and very health-conscious.  I don't even enjoy eating out most of the time because portions are so loaded with fats and enormous.  I get the ""pick 3"" salads from the salad case every time, and while it's a LOT of food, I clean my plate and feel no remorse.  Kale salad, ""Super"" salad, Qunioa salad, chick pea salad, roasted beets, and lentil salad are some favorites.  Of course the hummus is awesome.  Do your body a favor and eat at Sassool weekly!   ;)"
2015-10-16,5.0,"Wake Forest, NC",Piola,"We have eaten here on 2 occasions & a Living Social brought us in. The 1st time food was good, service was too. On the 2nd trip, lasagna & spaghetti& meatballs were good, but service was terrible. The table was dirty when the hostess sat us so, I had to ask they clean it. Hostess was oblivious to it! No one voluntarily filled our water glasses nor asked if we wanted another drink. Finally we caught another waitress to ask ours for refills. We watched our waitress walk all over to other tables then head to the kitchen but she never returned. The manager stopped by to ask if all was OK & we again requested more drinks, he went to the kitchen, talked to a few staff, then walked out onto the floor to visit other tables! Again their follow up was terrible. We will never go back. If the Manager is this absent minded how can he train his staff? The Management always sets the tone. Forget this place."
2015-10-16,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Glenwood Grill,"This place is awesome.  Excellent service and amazing food. I ordered the Carpet Bagger and it was cooked to perfection and absolutely delicious, highly recommend.  It's kind of tucked away back in a shopping plaza, but don't let the outside fool you.  This is a great date-night spot."
2015-10-16,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Second Empire Restaurant And Tavern,"I admit that high prices tend to make me hyper critical. But there just isn't ANYTHING negative I could say about Second Empire. The building itself is gorgeous, the service top notch and professional without being pretentious or stuffy. The food is brilliant. The prices are high, but I didn't feel out of line given the quality, the atmosphere, the service, the freshness and the size of the servings.Ex-butcher husband declared his ribeye one of the best pieces of meat he's had in ages. My duck breast was large with a sauce that was out of this world. Sides were unusual, imaginative and very good.One salad, two entrees, one bottle of lower cost wine = $126. Not cheap, IMHO. But oh so worth it!"

2015-10-16,4.0,"Falls Church, VA",Poole’s Downtown Diner,"This is my all time favorite spot in Raleigh. They have absolutely amazing food. I tried pretty much everything they have on the menu. Here is my favorite: Mac and cheese (I am not a Mac and cheese person and I have to order this every time). The braised short ribs, herb brined pork chop and roasted chicken are also very good. I am always in such a dilemma when it comes to order at poole's. Everything is just freaking amazing.  P.s: I just found out that the owner of this place also owns some of my beloved restaurants such as chuck's (great burger), Beasley's chicken (fried chicken)."
2015-10-17,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mellow Mushroom,Love this place! Great outdoor seating and great pizza and salads. My friends and I eat here often and they never disappoint!
2015-10-17,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Flights Restaurant & Lounge,"Guess I am old school.  When I go to a restaurant, I go for the food.  Not to be lavished on by staff, and not because of the surroundings.  Yes, those 2 things can enhance or detract from the meal, but unless they are such a distraction as to be annoying or an inconvenience, then its all about the food.  So there are 2 food components - quality and quantity.  They took a while but started us out with bread.  Very tasty. Then the meals came.  Mine was an entree, with 2 sides included, or so I expected.  The entire meal (scallops) could literally have been served on the small plate that the table was set with for one's bread.  The irony is it was served on an over-sized dinner plate.  Wish I had a photo to share.  I wont go into detail but let me borrow a line I once heard... there wasnt enough there to get skinny on.  The 4 stars overall rating surprised me a bit.  My guesses are that either they have only recently begun serving portions for the money that I would be embarrassed to serve if it were my restaurant, or other reviewers have bought into the trendy trap - that somehow a micro portion is a good thing.  The latter may be proved by my having said they served it on an oversized plate, as if to intentionally make the meal look smaller.  If I were on a diet, I would save my money and buy a small portion somewhere that is priced appropriately for a small portion.  I suppose some readers would say I am not sophisticated.  Well, I enjoy good food, and yes, what was there was tasty, but quality as I said is only part of the equation, and, being of the Dave Thomas school, the quantity was so disappointing as to have ""left a bad tasted in my mouth"".  If you buy into the trendy, then this place is for you. Thank goodness the very nice waitress offered a second serving of bread.  ( though no offer of a drink refill and I had to ask for butter for the additional bread).  Wonder if she knew the sarcasm in our politely made statement that we had no room left for dessert."
2015-10-17,5.0,"Chicago, IL",Los Cuates,"Great food, great service, and great prices.  What more could anyone ask for, as this is as close to California Mexican food as anyone will get in Raleigh.  Nothing fancy about the place, but who cares!"
2015-10-17,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Cristo’s NY Style Pizza,We tasted Meat lovers w/ xtra mushrooms. It's a thin crust NY style pizza. They have Grandma's Pizza which I would want to try next time. The crust would be crispy but w/ all the meat the front part became a little soft. For an XL not as big as NY style pizza. Service was fast. The Lasagna was good right amount of everything without the too sour tomato taste. Service was personal and knowledgeable. Ambience is good except that either doors open we could smell the smoker outside.
2015-10-17,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Casa San Carlo Italian Restaurant,"Dinner at Casa San Carlo was, as usual, spectacular. Chicken Marsala with mushrooms was deeply flavorful and perfectly tender. The house made bread basket is hot, fresh and bottomless, and it keeps me coming back for more. Pro tip: enjoy it with the Caprese salad, fresh tomatoes and mozzarella served with pesto and roasted red peppers.Dessert is definitely worth the calories here. Ask for the house made tiramisu or Ricotta 'cheesecake', or anything else the chef puts his considerable talents to. Prices are reasonable and portions generous; I usually go home full with leftovers for lunch. Speaking of lunch, their quick buffet is a great deal with a very tasty casual Italian selection. Do recommend!"
2015-10-17,4.0,"Knightdale, NC",Flying Saucer Draught Emporium,Great variety of choices of brews. The beer menu is lengthy. It helps to know what styles of beer you're into but the staff is helpful in making suggestions. They will bring you a sip to taste first to see if you like it. Went on a Friday night and there weren't a lot of specials - Sundays and Mondays are better for specials. It is loud with music and talking. The food menu is shorter with some witty titles and descriptions. The queso was exceptionally good!
2015-10-17,5.0,"Germantown, MD",Jimmy V’s Osteria & Bar,I tried the Valvano meatballs and a pizza.  You get two large meatballs covered in mozzarella cheese and well seasoned tomato sauce.  The flavor is very rich and authentic.  The pizza was really good as well.  The cheese was my favorite part of it.

Enjoyed their moonshine cocktails too! I had the strawberry moonshine w/ champagne- so flavorful! Overall good eats & good service. It's located in Lafayette Village which has some European ambience.
2015-10-17,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Big Ed’s North,"I really like Big Ed's North, it's exactly what I want in a breakfast place. They almost always have quick and friendly service. The breakfast meats are pretty solid. Coffee is good and the mug seems to enhance the drinking experience (I love a solid mug, don't you?). My favorites are their French toast and their omelettes. Big Ed's didn't try and mess with the formula from the downtown location. The North Raleigh location just looks a little more...North Raleigh on the inside. The only issue I have with this restaurant is that early in the morning the sun screams through the front window, so choose your seat wisely. Looks like they usually have a wait on the weekend after 8:30."
2015-10-17,3.0,"Dunn, NC",Rye Bar & Southern Kitchen,"The atmosphere was really warm and friendly. The food was not as good as it should have been for the price. The caviar deviled eggs were rubbery and cold. The cheer wine spare ribs were delicious. The mac and cheese was great! The carrots were the best part of the meal. The drink menu was unavailable due to them switching between summer and winter. We ordered desert and the waiter brought out a sampler on the house because they were out of what we wanted. We are glad they were free because they were pretty to look at but not much flavor. Overall, the portions were small and the prices were high. If the food was perfect and left a favorable taste it would be worth the price no matter the size of the portion."
2015-10-17,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kamado Grille,Stopped here to try it out and to watch my Mizzou football game - the service and food was awesome.  I'll for sure be coming here again whenever I get the chance. It's my new favorite place!
2015-10-18,3.0,"Columbus, OH",Guasaca,"What a great concept and execution on a Chipotle-style Venezuelan arepa restaurant. I've had arepas before, but Guasaca takes them to another level.The awesome thing about Guasaca is the ability to mix and match. A single arepa here is actually fairly sizable and good enough for a light lunch or snack. For a big eater like me though, you will need two arepas for a full meal. Each arepa is $3.50-4.00, so Guasaca is very reasonable.You can choose from a variety of protein: chicken, shredded beef, grilled steak, braised pork, braised tilapia and avocado chicken. You can also choose from a variety of sides: plantains, coleslaw, black beans, black eyed peas, caramelized onions, white cheese and pico de gallo. Finally you can choose from different sauces: red, wine vinegar, sour cream, Guasaca, cilantro and mustard. So yeah, the combinations are almost endless. If you don't want to create your own, Guasaca has 7 ""signature"" arepas to choose from. I opted for Guasaca's signature arepas. I ordered a signature chicken (grilled Chicken, black beans, pico de gallo, white Cheese & cilantro Sauce) and signature tilapia (braised tilapia, baked plantains, caramelized onions, white cheese & cilantro Sauce). The signature tilapia was my favorite. I really loved the baked plantains which added a nice touch of sweetness to the dish. Both the fish and chicken were well cooked and tasted fresh. I am very much of their cilantro sauce. Anyways, i'm surprised they only have one location, but i'm sure that will change soon."
2015-10-18,4.0,"Houston, TX",The Flying Biscuit Café,"Need a table for six? Go home, you're still drunk. Worst idea ever since you'll be waiting during peak hours. In fact, go get you a carafe of mimosas per person since 1. You're already drunk for coming here with a 6-top in mind2. It'll be a while, so might as well.Just two? Go sit at the bar, which is open seating.A hot, fluffy biscuit served with a sweet cranberry apple butter? Lovely.Service? Staff was fabulous.Food here is quite $$$ when you think about eggs and toast, but they do it pretty well and serve it piping hot. An average brekkie entree will run ya about $10 without coffee or add-ons. Solid eats, but not worth the line if you asked me to wait."
2015-10-18,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",BURGERFI,"Tried this place because the reviews were great and we wanted a good burger for a family dinner out. The burgers were good. The regular burger and cheeseburger are double  burgers and have 2 beef patties. They are the smaller pub burger size buns sob the double was not a huge burger.  Cooked well done with slight charing on the outside. Fries were my favorite. They were fresh cut and not those tiny little shoestring fries some other places offer. Real potato taste made them a hit! We ordered the combination ""Cry & Fry"" with both fries and onion rings. The rings were real beer battered and tasted good but they were huge pieces so we got 3 rings. I think they would have tasted better cut into smaller more traditional rings. We tried the chocolate shake and it was pretty good but they put sprinkles and whipped cream on top even though we asked for it to be left off.  My final judgement was on the price. For 3 people with 3 burgers and 2 shakes with 1 order of fries and rings we paid almost $40. So I have to ask myself if it was worth that much before I'll go back. It was the price of the extras; $2.50 for a fountain drink, over $8 for two shakes that drove the cost up. I thought the burgers were reasonably priced., but it was just the burger. The $$ on Yelp was exactly right."
2015-10-18,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Oak,"My fiance and I came for Sunday brunch this morning. We had a pretty good experience. Our waitress, Alex, was plenty friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. We were glad we had made a reservation, as there was already quite a line when they opened at 11. The food was pretty good - I got the skillet and my fiance got the burrito. The best part of the meal was the jalepeno cream sauce that came with the burrito. After tasting the sauce, I asked for some to go with my (slightly bland) skillet. The waitress explained that they were a scratch made kitchen and were out. At 11:40. 40 minutes after opening for Sunday brunch. Ooookay. Definitely worth the Groupon price, not worth full price to go back again."
2015-10-18,5.0,"Charlotte, NC",Black Cat Cafe,Great service and location. Nothing fancy but consistently delicious and fresh food. Raleigh's best kept local secret.
2015-10-18,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",State Farmers Market Restaurant,"The one star is for the good service only. We visit the Farmer's Market all the time for its fresh, delicious produce, pastries etc. and assumed the Farmer's Market restaurant would be an extension of that experience. Unfortunately this is not the case. The food is simply disgusting, nothing is fresh (how is that even possible?), and the food made both me and my husband sick. I don't like giving bad reviews, but I'm writing this in the hopes that someone doesn't stop through Raleigh and think this is representative of our local food scene, considering its right off the interstate. Save yourself and keep driving down Lake Wheeler towards Boulted Bread or Big Ed's downtown for real food."
2015-10-18,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar,"I love Cowfish, mostly because of how inventive and fun the dishes and ambiance are. I actually went to the original one in Charlotte when I went to visit a friend and when I moved to Raleigh I was excited to see they opened their second location at North Hills. (And actually there's one in Orlando now too, at Universal CityWalk.)There is usually a wait here for dinner. I think it gets REALLY busy around peak dinner time, especially because it's great for kids/families, then dies down around 8pm. I've had several things here from the edamame in its simplest form (portion is very generous), to Mary Had a Little Lamburgushi roll, to the What's Shakin' Tuna Bacon sandwich and most of what I order is stuff I can't get anywhere else (aside from edamame, of course). Their shakes are great too and worth the calories once in a while, if you ask me. They're one of the only places I know on that focus on meat in sushi (you can definitely get just fish sushi there too) and they do it so well.  It's always fun to try something different here. They do have valet parking or you can self park. I always like to drop someone off when we get there to put our names down (see above - there's usually a wait) and find a spot in the nearby garage or adjacent parking lot. The restaurant design is awesome - they have several fish tanks and really funny posters everywhere if you take the time to notice and read them. They also have a cute TV fish tank near the bathroom with a cowfish in it (the yellow, flat-bellied fish with ""horns"") and there's a recording in the bathroom that teaches you Japanese! I've sat at a table several times and the bar towards the back - the bar has touch screen monitors underneath it where you can play games - great for kids and adults. The staff is always accommodating and they want to ensure their customers are happy. I take family and friends here when they visit Raleigh and everyone always adores it!"
2015-10-18,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Taste Small Plates | Wine Bar,"OMFG, this place is awesome!  Everything my husband and I had was absolutely delicious. The cocktails were perfect, I enjoyed the Dirty Goat; their riff on the classic dirty martini. It was surprising light and refreshing. Usually the brine and/or the alcohol in a dirty martini knocks you out, no so here. My husband had the Vanilla Manhattan, another hit. I usually don't drink bourbon but I tried this and it was amazing.Now the food: So on point. Everything we had (which was a lot) was so good. Like lick the plate good. I love the tapas style as we were able to taste (no pun intended) so many scrumptious offerings. Being from DC, living out West in AZ and LA I will say that the food is on caliber with many other restaurants we've dined at. PS- try the jalapeño popper: one of the best things I've ever eaten."
2015-10-18,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",b.good,"I love this place. They're in North Hills at the end of the newer side by Chuy's restaurant. It's a no fuss place - you order at the counter and they bring it to your table or, as I usually do, you can take it to go. I love that the ingredients are always fresh, from kale to avocado to squash - AND they support local NC farmers. The quinoa bowls are awesome - they're filling and a healthy option. They have a super grain mix you can get instead of quinoa too. I know they have burgers and fries and such but I love the bowls I just always get the same thing! Spicy avocado and lime bowl is my go to - I've gotten the Moroccan inspired bowl too and it's always good! They have tofu you can add, which I love. Great for vegans and vegetarians! Bowls are about $9-$12 depending on protein addition. Highly recommended! And if you join their rewards program you get lots of goodies offered too."

2015-10-18,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Neomonde Bakery & Deli,This place was delicious! A friend who grew up in Raleigh recommended it. If you like mediterranean and want an over-the-counter delicious meal this is your place! I got the lasagna lunch special - eggplant veggie lasagna with two sides (beet salad and hummus though there were so many I wanted to try). If you tell them it's your first time they give you a small cube of baklava to try (very good!). It was under $9. I'll be back!

The drinks are great, food is great, and the atmosphere will put a smile on the face... not true gourmet food, but they do things right and it's always a fun time. 1/2 price apps before 6 is awesome! Never had a bad server, either. They are doing something right."

2015-10-18,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Stanbury,"Stanbury was excellent! I've heard good things and I don't know why I assumed it was an upscale fancy place but it's not really. It's just nice enough to be a good weekend meal with friends but just casual enough to feel like you can go during the week and sit at the bar and feel comfy.We got there and it was packed on a Friday night but the hostess was so sweet and said she thought a couple was going to finish their drinks at the bar soon - did we want her to save the seats for us when they paid and left? Yes! She told us a waitress would take our drink order in the meantime. Perfect. We ordered...and the table was ready for us shortly after. When we sat the cocktails were delivered!We ordered the pickled salmon starter with beets (I don't love pickled salmon, I have realized but I imagine if you do, this was a great dish - I do love beets and they were spot on!), and the fried oyster dish (GET IT!) and shared a main dish of fresh tagliatelle, which was delicious. It was fun to sit at the end of the bar closest to the kitchen too, and watch the cooks make things. They know what they're doing.Ambiance, service, price, flavors: all A+. Can't wait to go back! Great for a date or evening out with friends, but probably best for parties of 1-4."
2015-10-18,2.0,"Arlington, VA",MachuPicchu Peruvian Cuisine,"Only my second Yelp review ever, so take it for what it's worth. Shouldn't have been all that surprised considering it's a Peruvian restaurant in Raleigh, but the food is more like a variation of what Peruvian food tastes like without the authentic ingredients. I've visited Peru 5 times, my wife is Peruvian. The papa huacaina sauce was not good and tastes nothing like the sauce in Peru. In fact there is a sauce that comes in a squeeze pouch that I get from Peru that tastes a lot better. $20 for subpar lomo Saltado was disappointing. One of the main ingredients in the sauce, red wine vinegar, was noticeably missing. The seco de Rez is supposed to have a very cilantro-y sauce base, there was absolutely none at all. The owners claim to represent the Lima style of cooking but it is not. I had caterers at my wedding in Lima and we had seco as an item and it was excellent and the sauce was cilantro based. Ahi de gallina was okay. Same sauce as the papa huacaina but mixed with rice and chicken it was better. Biggest gripe is that I asked for one extra purple olive for my ahi de gallina dish and was refused because the olives are, according to the chef, very special and expensive. I like to blend my purple olives with my ahi de gallina and only one was on my plate. An extra olive would have made the dish a little bit better. If a restaurant, let alone a Peruvian restaurant, where people are usually very hospitable, can't offer its guests one extra purple olive, something must be wrong. 2 stars is for the service and the coconut flan. Coconut flan isn't really Peruvian per se, so it's ironic that the best dish we had wasn't technically a traditional Peruvian dish. I hate sounding like a snob, and Peruvian food is hard to replicate, but I believe the owners are doing their guests who may have never tried authentic Peruvian food, a huge disservice. One of the waiters told me he was hoping that the owners would soon plan a trip for entire restaurant staff to go to Peru to try the cuisine there. If they end up going, the waiter will surely be disappointed knowing that the food he is serving now is not as authentic as the owners lead him to believe."

2015-10-18,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Ajisai Japanese Fusion,"The best hot & sour soup in Raleigh! Discovered Ajisai last year on a trip to Cameron Village and I'm so glad I did. The sashimi selection is impressive and the rolls are so fresh and consistently yummy. I've become a Manhattan roll loyalist (tuna, avocado, yellowtail and a jalapeño citrus sauce that's to die for). The hot and sour soup is soul-warming. Try it and you'll see what I mean.The takeout is also great- I was feeling under the weather a few weeks ago and the hot and sour soup and vegetable gyoza were the perfect pick-me-up."
2015-10-18,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chuck’s,"I had high hopes for this place, being an Ashley Christensen restaurant (a local ""famous"" chef who owns several great restaurants in downtown Raleigh) but it was just a total let down.The fries were the highlight with great dipping sauces but the service sucked (and there was barely anyone in the restaurant on a weekend around 2pm) and the burgers were sad. We went with a juicy, delicious burger in mind and got a sad looking patty on a regular 'ole potato bun we could have purchased at Harris Teeter ourselves. I don't get burgers often (maybe once or twice a year) so to ""waste"" it on this was just disappointing. The ambiance is fine - black and white clean design. But who cares about the ambience when everything else about it was blah? Cost - a little overpriced. Definitely won't be back any time soon."
2015-10-18,4.0,"Lemon Springs, NC",Mami Nora’s,"The chicken is delicious.  Super smoky and so flavorful.  Dipping sauces to die for, especially the green one! Yucca fries so light and soft.

2015-10-18,4.0,"Austin, TX",Rye Bar & Southern Kitchen,"When it's time to feed, I know that I long for a place where the hostess never appears, even as my group grows, milling around the floor of the restaurant like a pod of killer whales, playful but hungry, wary.I think, ""maybe if I can just get someone to bus this table..."" While the gathering storm of family members churns about, grumbling. Eventually the server appears, clears the table. We take our seats, anxious.The order is taken, slowly. And then we wait. And wait. And wait. And waaaaaaaaaaait. The drinks come. Some of them are wrong. Some are just weak. And some are simply... Not there. It takes 30 minutes for the server to inform us that they don't have the beer that was ordered. They are ""making"" the order of wine. I picture a strapping, shirtless Italian lad in the back, stomping grapes, lovingly sealing casks. Alas, I doubt this is the case.The food comes. One. Plate. At. A. Time. For a party of 12. Oh how I wish I was exaggerating. The food? Mediocre, over sugared, and artlessly presented. Our little snack took well over an hour to receive. This did wonders for our dinner schedule.After a long night of wedding festivities, we return, hesitantly, to the bar. I stand at the bar, waiting to be served. This next shift of profound incompetence reveals 2 bartenders, both looking straight through me and serving the 2 people who came to the bar after me first. The lean Middle Aged male barkeep calls women ""sweetie"" which I find insulting and a bit revolting. I am eventually served. The only redeeming thing I can think of is being asked if I wanted my beer 16 or 23 ounces. Methinks it's gonna take at least 23 ounces of swill to wash the bad taste of this pathetic excuse for a restaurant/bar out of your mouth."
2015-10-18,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Fiction Kitchen,"I've heard such great things about this place and I've been wanting to try it for a while, especially because I live within walking distance. I'm not a vegetarian but I eat mostly veggies and fish. So on a Thursday night I took my Kindle and walked there to sit at the bar and enjoy an evening with good food. I was quickly greeted by friendly staff. I sat at the bar (bonus points for hooks under the bar for a coat and/or handbag!) the bartender (also friendly) asked me what I would like. I ordered a dirty martini. It was delicious - definitely not too dirty (tasted like really, really well chilled vodka with two delicious olives in it) served in a rocks glass. But it was great. I ordered the Farmer's Plate for the day, which was Indian/curry inspired (but not spicy/hot at all) with sweet potatoes, cauliflower, and basmati rice topped with the most gorgeous maitake (aka Hen of the Woods) mushroom. I thought about ordering an app as well but I was worried it'd be too much food for one person - glad I didn't! The dish came and it was big. Definitely didn't have room for an appetizer! The flavors were really good and well balanced. Unfortunately my only complaint is that it was gritty in a few bites - as in someone didn't wash all the dirt off the veggies - but whatever...I overlooked that because everything else was on par. Ambience, service, prices (drinks: $10, main course: $18, which was market price for the daily farmers plate special) - all great. I'll be back!"
2015-10-18,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Fiction Kitchen,"Fiction Kitchen is unique and creative in every possible way.  Even though the food is vegetarian/vegan, you definitely will be satisfied!  Each dish is extremely creative and prepped well, which makes everything very delicious.  Don't be put off by the protein alternative options... the ""chicken"" and waffles tastes great!! Make sure to add the sweet and spicy sauce on top.The decor is pretty, but the restaurant is on the small side.  I've always had to wait for a table, since they don't make reservations, but it is well worth the time. Friendly staff and some really great cocktails offered."
2015-10-18,1.0,"Wake Forest, NC",Rye Bar & Southern Kitchen,"First of all if food is the only thing you care about it is 4.8 STARS!!!Amazing cheerwine ribs, goat cheese carrots, (skip the southern deviled eggs ..... very boring and mine were frozen in middle had to send them back.)and the restaurant is beautiful!For the not so great parts:It's loud, we went early on a Friday (5:30) and the acoustics are horrible, we had a table of 8 and could only hear the person immediately to your left or right and had to yell to the person across from me.Server had a great personality, but not a great server.  We only got one of the two appetizers we ordered. 2 out of 8 plates had the incorrect sides. We were there on Oct 16th and they were ""in between season"" cocktails so no special cocktails.... so after much prying he did say they could make a rum punch, and it was good but as this was one of the main reasons we chose this restaurant .... a big disappointment.And out of the 5 dessert options we ordered 2 and the first one was brought out and (10 FULL minutes later) the server comes to the table to let us know that they were out of the other... just aggravating.  I would anticipate letting us know that up front so table could decide whether to go else where for dessert as a group.  We will not be back, but as previously mentioned the food was pretty good."
2015-10-18,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Poole’s Downtown Diner,"I really like Poole's. I think there's something for everyone there and the food's excellent. My only complaint is it's really annoying to read the menus on blackboards (because they're not convenient to every table) but that's about it. The mixed drinks are good (but not too strong, always - perhaps a but inconstant) and the wine options are strong. I've had the mac n cheese, which I know people RAVE about, but I don't love it here. There's a TON of butter in it and made with small elbow macaroni. I don't know - just not my fave. Aside from that I've had the pimento cheese appetizer, which I adore, the crab cakes (they were good but not great), a salmon dish over a succotash blend, and several desserts in the three times I've been there over the past year. It's a fun place to share things with friends/family. It's usually really busy and they don't accept reservations (the restaurant's not that big) but it's fun to get a drink and wait if the wait isn't insane. Good ambience that makes it feel a little fancier than it probably is, partially due to dim lighting and nice interior design. Somehow it all works to put you in the mood for great food and great conversation with good drinks. And this is a little random but worth noting - the women's restroom has all sort of thoughtful things in it like a jar of bobby pins, cotton pads, hair spray, lotion....just nice!"
2015-10-18,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Morning Times,"Morning Times is great for an affordable breakfast just a walk from my apartment downtown, with no fuss and easy ordering. It's right next to Raleigh Times bar. It says ""COFFEE"" in a big neon sign in the front top window.Service is always good, line moves quickly. You order at the counter and if you order food receive a number to place on the table for them to deliver it to you. A bit random but they don't have Sweet n Low if you like that! (I do.) I believe they have Splenda, Sugar in the Raw and simple syrup for sweeteners. I recommend the breakfast burrito and any breakfast sandwich. The omelet a friend got was huge and looked amazing and I saw someone at the table next to us get the french toast and it looked awesome.I believe you can get beer there as well as coffee, they have a small fridge with fresh Humdinger juices, and teas as well. They have outdoor seating (just a few tables) and most of their seating is upstairs. Lots of people always doing work on computers there or reading. Good, relaxed vibe."
2015-10-18,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Jose and Sons,My favorite place to sit here is actually the bar. I've sat at tables and for some reasons the service always sucks - but the bar is great. It's great for groups - they take reservations and can accommodate larger parties.Highlights include the mac n cheese with bacon (it's heavy so if you get it - know that it's really filling) and the ceviche. The ceviche has changed over the past year - it was best when they had avocado in it and they served it in a cute mason jar but they don't seem to do that anymore. Still good and worth getting with a Dos Equis on tap! Their Sunday brunch is good too but with limited hours so be sure to call if you're going on the weekend!
2015-10-18,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Taverna Agora,"Welcome to downtown, Taverna Agora. I can't really tell you much about the old location, since it didn't seem worth the drive from downtown. But, the new location is very nice, with good food, open-window seating on the 1st floor, and a great rooftop.Taverna is one of the latest additions to what was a mostly-abandoned section of Hillsborough Street. But now with State of Beer, Runologie, a refreshed Holiday Inn (was Clarion) and Taverna, there's a bit of new life there.Lunch is priced mostly reasonable, with gyros currently going for $9 and a gyro salad at $11. You'll definitely get a cheaper Greek meal out of Shish Kabob in City Plaza or Jasmin Bistro over on State's campus. But, Taverna Agora and Sitti (Lebanese) are the only two Mediterranean sit-down options in downtown.I've been to Taverna a few times for lunch and after-work drinks, and service has been mostly very good. I've been happy with everything I've ordered. The Agora Lunch Platter is one of my go-to's, since it has a bit of everything - gyro, pita, salad, and fries.Opa!"

Not to mention, everyone is very friendly.The food is ""Southern Comfort"" style with portions that are worth the money you are spending. I had one of the specials, the tomato pie which was topped with filet mignon in a bordelaise. It was amazing. I am a big cheese fan and the pie had a decent amount of cheese to my liking. There was also a yummy side salad to go with my main meal. Of course, we got dessert, and I have to say any dessert you get, you won't be disappointed. Rich, creamy, flavorful cakes, so delicious. This place is worth checking out. Reservations for 4 or more, is highly recommended."

Also, shoutout to Chef Hamm for actually speaking with us and joking and answering questions, that's what makes a restaurant if you ask me!I ordered the daily special of pumpkin pancakes chorizo and eggs. When I say it was AMAZING I don't think that does it justice! You have to see for yourself. The pancakes literally melted in my mouth from deliciousness. The chorizo is always one of my favorites so of course I loved it! BEST EGGS I HAVE EVER HAD!! Seriously. I ordered a side of the season special cream cheese that usually goes with the stuffed toast because it was pumpkin cream cheese and it came together so nicely! I will 100% be coming back in the future, might as well call me a regular! If you haven't made your reservation yet you truly are losing at life right now and need to get this amazing place ASAP."
2015-10-19,2.0,"Columbus, OH",Shaba Shabu,"I came here for a post-exam lunch. Shaba Shabu is a great place for lunch. They have daily $5.99 lunch specials and also buy one get one free sushi rolls (range from $7-17). I ended up getting the Diablo and Fish Lover Rolls. They were both good, but not great. Fish quality seemed decent and portion sizes were good. The sushi also came out quickly, which was another plus They have about 50 different types of rolls to choose from. While variety is good, choosing from 50 can also be a little difficult. Oh well, first world problems.Another plus is their draft beer selection. Visiting North Carolina for a few days, it was nice to try some local beers on draft. They also have nightly drink specials.Overall, Shaba Shabu is a solid sushi option. The interior decor is also nice and modern. Of course it's a Japanese-Thai fusion restaurant, so don't expect the most authentic Japanese fare. A lot of the rolls are pretty ""Americanized"", but I am not hating on that. I'm sure there's something for everyone.*3.5 stars*"

Me! A meat and potatoes Midwestern girl, with cheese that literally flows through my veins!  Because these new dietary restrictions are so new and so all encompassing, eating out has been something I've been dreading. I don't  want to have to be that person that is like ""so what kind of oil did you cook this in? are you sure there's no hidden soy in this? and by vegetable oil ...does that include soy bean oil?"" so I knew I had to find an allergy friendly place, and the remedy diner popped into my mind. we've walked past it on multiple occasions, it's a cute little bar / restaurant. I decided after looking at the menu that it was a place we could give a try. I roll in with my stroller, and they quickly accommodate us on the back secret patio. it was decorated so cute back there, and it kept my 3 month old totally occupied with all the stringed lights overhead. before I ordered, I told my server about my avoiding dairy and soy. I've then told her what I thought I'd like, and she helped me to adjust the dish appropriately. she did not judge me or think I was too peculiar, and seemed to know exactly what ingredients were in every dish! I had done it! I had ordered and wss ""that"" person, and it wasn't all that bad! my food arrived, and my sandwich was delicious. my husband loved the sandwich he got as well. the soup. The soup was amazing!!!!! when it came time for dessert, we found an option that I could handle. I could eat the chocolate cake, but not the frosting. I was a little disappointed thinking that I would be eating chocolate cake but not chocolate icing, but my sweet tooth demanded something. to my surprise and delight, my server not only brought out said chocolate cake, but a small side of whipped rice dream milk.... my version of whipped cream. I know this is something they did especially for me to accommodate my needs... not only was it delicious, but it's what invoked this entire review.  kudos to the staff of the remedy diner. they took the situation that I have been dreading for months and made it into such a positive pleasant experience. it was done with grace, with ease, and it was clear that they take pride in the work that they do. whether my family continues to be on ths dairy free soy free diet in the future, I know that we will continue to visit the remedy diner and no longer just walk past it!"

Two of us ordered the fried chicken sandwich (probably our mistake for not ordering a burger at a burger joint) but the meat was dark meat and not a breast. We were both very disappointed with this cut. The other two in our party got burgers and both really enjoyed them. Only flaw was forgetting the beets on my Fiancés burger. The fresh cut fries are good and sauces are tasty. Our favorite is the comeback sauce. Our server was great- we forget his name but he was on top of everything. We will return and be sure to try the burger.

Ultimately, I still always get what I asked for quite quickly, and that's all that really matters I suppose.Food? No complaints. It really does come out bubbling and super hot.

She was not only attentive but very outgoing very personable very sweet always there when we needed anything she had other tables but still made sure that we were taking care of and made us feel like we were the important ones in the restaurant. So if you go to this place I highly suggest that you try to get Kayla as your server she really is incredible. Now that's just about the service alone to talk at all everybody else was incredibly nice incredibly outgoing the food was more than fantastically amazing and I'm not one to ever send food back and unfortunately I had to because I forgot to ask for it without something but they did it with no issues that it very fast very efficiently everything was just amazing. I don't know anybody else that's reviewing this place was thinking without giving them five stars hands down from the moment you get into the moment you leave you're going to get a great experience and fantastic food.

And then when we arrived there were a couple of people who came without a reservation and they were told that they would have to wait about an hour and a half if they wanted a table, because they had so many reservations.We started our meal by ordering a couple of appetizers to share. We had the calamari which was really good. But it is not the typical fried calamari that you get, so if you think you might be weirded out by the texture of un-fried calamari, then maybe order something else. We also ordered the Shrimp Napoli which was delicious! I loved the crunch from it being coated in breadcrumbs! Also, this is not the place to skip out on the complimentary bread.  For my main meal, I ordered the small Spinaci flatbread, which is topped with spinach, mushrooms and artichokes. But don't let the word ""small"" deceive you, because I was only able to eat half of it and was able to take the rest home for leftovers. I would order this flatbread again in a heartbeat, because I loved the combination of toppings. I also tried the cannoli for dessert. While it was good, I think it is a little pricey considering you only get one cannoli for $7.Service was good and despite being on the patio, the atmosphere was nice. I think Bella Monica would  be a nice, cozy date spot if you can get a reservation to sit inside. I definitely recommend trying it out if you are craving Italian food. But just make sure to crave it in advance and make a reservation!"

The meal was very prompt and very fast for our large group.  The atmosphere is ole school Cafe Americana, but the food is far better than average.  The physical restaurant is very clean and the staff goes out of their way to ensure all guests are satisfied. If you are in Downtown Raleigh make your way to Pooles for a pleasant surprise."

Place isn't much on the eye, but if you know what I'm talking about, the smell of the hand-crafted pizza hits your nostrils as soon as you walk in the door. Kudos to Frank and all the staff for delivering some of the best pizza I've had in the Triangle."

2015-10-20,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Devolve Moto,"Gear HeavenTired of the same old boring overpriced local gear and having to rely on online retailers to fulfill your needs? Then you need to stop by this place. I stumbled upon this shop while taking a ride around town and was immediately impressed with the selection, the atmosphere, and the staff. I had been searching for a Kriega backpack (something no local shops carry) and there was the entire line among other items I have never seen available in a NC shop. But what was most impressive was the price. They actually had the same prices at those on my favorite sites without any need for haggling (yes I am very Thrifty). This is almost unheard of in a brick and mortar store. This combined with their enthusiasm for anything on two wheels has made me a customer for life.Great job guys!!!!!!!!"
2015-10-20,4.0,"Durham, NC",Wakefield Tavern,"We decided to check this place out one late Sunday night when most places were closed.  We were excited reading the great reviews for this place.  Wakefield Tavern did not disappoint- we thoroughly enjoyed our meal!Highlights:+ Hot wings were pretty good.  My partner loves his wings crispy, and these were fried crisp.- Southwestern quesadilla we weren't too thrilled with.  The filling was delicious but the actual tortilla was a little dense.  We took our leftovers back, and cooked them on a pan with butter till the tortilla was golden brown and crisp, and that made it really amazing.+++ The fried polenta cakes with shrimp and bacon were HEAVENLY.  The polenta cakes themselves were incredibly crispy on the outside but moist and fluffy on the inside.  The cakes came with plump, fresh shrimp and bacon in a creamy sauce.++ The chicken pot pie was really good.  It was definitely made fresh and was chock-full of yummy potatoes and chicken.  We really enjoyed it.++ The shepherd's pie was also a treat.  It was made with lamb, but the lamb had a vey neutral flavour and so didn't overpower the dish.  We were a little disappointed that the cheddar on top was gooey and so didn't really differ in texture from the potato.  We took our leftovers home and baked it a little longer until the cheese got brown and crisp, and that really made the pie *amazing*+++ We loved our desserts.  We absolutely love trying home-made desserts, and Wakefield Tavern did not disappoint.  Their NY cheesecake was excellent, and so was the seasonal pumpkin brownie.All in all, great place for a great dinner.  We will certainly be back!"

2015-10-20,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mandolin,"Once again my wife and I had an awesome meal at Mandolin.  We took my parents for the first time this past weekend and they loved it as well. My wife and I have been several times, but because the menu changes so often, it's like a new restaurant each time.  I went with the porkchop which is typically a staple and awesome, my mom went with the country fried steak, my Dad tried Chicken and waffles for the first time in his life, and my wife had the red drum.  All our entrees were cooked perfectly, and the wait staff was very attentive. We also ordered a couple chocolate souffles for dessert, which I highly recommend everyone try them, but make sure to order them when you order your meal as they take some time to prepare."

2015-10-20,2.0,"Santa Fe Springs, CA",Gino’s Pizza,"Stopped in NC for a weekend trip. A few pizza spots came up on my search. When I seen the name Gino's appear, I thought this has to be a good spot. It was located in a small shopping center. When I saw the outside I was not expecting such good quality pizza to come out of this establishment. I say never judge the outside by the inside. Once I saw the sign saying 2 slices and a drink for 6 bucks, I was very interested. To keep a long story short. They slices were huge! I got one cheese, and one sausage slice. I couldn't even finish and I still wanted to keep eating NY style pizza that is sold here. The guy helping me I would assume was Gino. If you was large hot slices of NY style pizza. Stop by and give this joint a try."
2015-10-20,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Fu Kee Express,"I love Fu Kee's.  As many of the other reviews have noted, Fu Kee's is only operated by one guy.  And for one guy, he's pretty dang efficient.  He's got huge portions and he never skimps on the meat, or the sauce.  The food is always delicious with plenty of seasoning.  My favorite is the Crab Rangoon and his Orange Chicken.  The dinner portions are huge, with the meat filling up an entire takeout container.  The Rangoons are huge with ample stuffing that is the perfect consistency.  I've heard he adds honey to the mixture to keep it so perfect, but hands down it is the best Crab Rangoon I've ever had.  The orange chicken is SO GOOD.  Big pieces of white meat that aren't 75% breading.  There'll even be a few orange slices in there for extra orange-y flavor.  Just these two dishes are enough to feed 3 people.I've seen some complaints on here about how long the wait is, and I've seen customers walk out in a huff due to standing at the counter without anyone greeting them in the restaurant.  He's a one-man operation!  Ordering ahead of time for takeout at Fu Kee's is absolutely necessary.  The wait times he gives are usually around 20-30 minutes, which is actually quite reasonable, especially for food this delicious.  I've had a few other entrees, including the Mongolian Beef, Pork Fried Rice, and the Chicken with Garlic Sauce.  All are certainly tasty, but not quite good enough to rave about like the Orange Chicken and Crab Rangoons.  All in all, Fu Kee's is a very solid choice for Chinese takeout in the area.  I live all the way in NW Raleigh, and I can't stop myself from venturing here at least once a month."
2015-10-20,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",First Watch,"I've been to the Glenwood location of First Watch, and it was really good so I certainly had some expectations.  I chose the Breakfast Scramble (Scrambled eggs, spinach, ham and melted Cheddar and Monterey Jack on multigrain toast that was topped with hollandaise and served with fresh fruit and fresh, seasoned potatoes.).  I asked for the spinach not to be mixed in and instead fresh on the side.  My friend ordered the Eggs Benedict with ham and tomatoes (Two poached eggs atop a toasted English muffin piled with ham and tomatoes covered in hollandaise. Served with fresh, seasoned potatoes.)Our waitress was super friendly and served all my annoying needs (the spinach on the side, warmed milk) with a smile.  The wait time for the food was short and the ambiance was very nice.  However, it couldn't make up for the subpar food.  My breakfast scramble hollandaise sauce had congealed quite well to the cheese by the time I received it.  In fact, I couldn't taste the hollandaise at all.  It was hard, and had zero taste.  The scramble was very bland, and I had to use large amounts of ketchup to add some flavor.  The spinach was NOT fresh.  It looked like it was at least a week old, and there were little bits of spinach that were limp and slimy.  The potatoes were also a disappointment.  My pieces were the little end bits and were all super tiny.  My friend got giant chunks of potatoes that were still raw and crunchy.  His hollandaise on the benedict was also rather flavorless and disappointing.We expected the same level of food quality through all the locations of First Watch, and this was not the case.  At checkout, the waiter asked us how our food was, and we told him it was really quite mediocre and meh.  He just looked at us and shrugged.  I'll venture to the Glenwood location from now on."
2015-10-20,4.0,"Annapolis, MD",Rye Bar & Southern Kitchen,"Bottom Line: A decadent menu and a modern, southern and charming atmosphere Most of the time I am weary of restaurants attached to hotels but Rye is worth a visit for sure.  The restaurant and bar are both sizable and are often filled with the sounds of local music.  Depending on what is happening in downtown, there can be a wait for a table but Rye does take reservations.  The staff is friendly although I did find service to be a tad slow.  What makes Rye worth a return trip is the food!  The food is southern, decadent and delicious.  The ribs were tender and the barbecue chicken was moist and flavorful.  Side dishes like honey roasted carrots with goat cheese and macaroni and cheese are worthy too."
2015-10-20,5.0,"Scranton, PA",Second Empire Restaurant And Tavern,"All bark no bite. Second empire is a fancy environment for sure but all their food is precooked and frozen.:( boo with a place like that, you'd think they would make everything fresh. I feel like you can taste that it's from the freezer too because all the flavors are not very strong. I think they try and cover it up with salt,  The staff is amazing though, very helpful."

This place was amazing!  The food was unbelievable even the chips and salsa brought out were far above the regular Mexican restaurant.  The service was great and for as amazing as the food was the price was very reasonable.  If you go get the pork and waffles it was awesome!

The food options were great - lots to choose from. I had a chicken pasta but it was delicious! Great flavor and fresh. Will definitely try again for more option! Love that there is a rooftop area also, especially as the weather is nice!"
2015-10-20,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Godavari Indian Restaurant,"Really wonderful and authentic food with lots of flavor!  The dishes are served family style, which makes it great for sharing.  It's great this way because you get to try an assortment of their yummy dishes rather than just one.Warning: they seem to have their own idea of spiciness levels.  My friends and I ordered ""medium"" spicy dishes (because ya know asians love spicy food) and we ended up with drippy noses and burning mouths!  Staff was nice and attentive, pretty decor, and the menu had plenty of options."
2015-10-21,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",O’Malley’s Pub & Restaurant,"Absolute worst service I have ever seen. We will certainly never be back. We went for breakfast/lunch put in our order and then waitress disappeared. Never came back and told us that it was going to take an hour for food or even to offer us a refill on drinks. After we finally got our food and was finished waitress was again no where to be seen so another waitress cleared our table and when ours finally came back then she offered us another drink and we told her we wanted the check. Again she disappeared so we finally went up to the manager at the bar who also knew we were having a bad experience and she pretty much backed up her waitress completely. Said that they were extremely busy and there kitchen was not set up to handle breakfast at the same time as lunch..... then why would you offer it? And yes they were busy but ran by our table which was so close to the bar 50 times. Surprisingly enough the only thing they did right was not charge us for our meal which seriously would have been shocking if they did.  Long story short, not worth to go there we will be finding another Irish pub because there service is just downright rude."

Impressive decor an the seating was well designed, both inside and out. I had the rib-eye and my wife had the tuna dish.

2015-10-21,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Alpaca Peruvian Charcoal Chicken,"I'm not sure how Peruvian chicken is made differently from other rotisserie chicken but all I know is it is better.  More juicy, more flavorful.  Alpaca is sheer food madness.  I was shopping across the street at K&G and the cashier said Alpaca was amazing.  I had to try it.Everything on the menu looks stellar but I went with the 1/4 chicken dark meat with black beans and rice. My friend had the white meat version with salad and chicken soup.  All of it was amazing.  Your meal comes with two interesting sauces - green and yellow versions. Don't know what they are called other than a slam dunk of goodness.The service is fast and bilingual which was a pleasant surprise.  The space was clean and they were constantly sweeping up when anyone was done at their table. Really liked this place and will be back soon."
2015-10-21,2.0,"Austin, TX",Humble Pie,"First off, the staff was so friendly and the atmosphere just right!  Now the most important part - the food.  Absolutely every thing we had was amazing.  The cheese plate was fresh, the hummus delicious, the brussel sprouts perfect, the scallops melt in your mouth and the brownie decadent.  We were there with a big party and yet there was no slow down in service or corners cut on quality when it came to the food. I will happily return when in town next."

I'll be back for sure!"

2015-10-21,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chopstix Gourmet and Sushi Bar,"In all candor, we probably wouldn't have even tried this restaurant, much less known about it, if we hadn't noticed a coupon in a dining guide coupon book.We opted for sesame chicken and pad Thai to go and a side salad. The pad Thai had a unique flavor and just a bit of spice.My only gripe is that I would have liked more carrots and chicken in it. Also, they forgot to package the ginger dressing for my salad. Nevertheless, we were pleased with our meals. It's definitely a step up from Noodles and Company.The other thing I should mention is they have an crazy extensive menu. Some Thai, mostly Chinese, some hibachi I think, and lots of sushi. It's seriously overwhelming!We will definitely be back and maybe eat inside next time."

2015-10-21,5.0,"Cary, NC",Death & Taxes,I don't get it. Can someone explain what is all the hype about? A staff of Millennials who are narcissistic and could not be bothered when asked simple questions- like how do you eat those runny mashed potatoes that had been described as a casserole? I will say that the oysters were great.
2015-10-21,4.0,"Durham, NC",Fu Kee Express,"Had lunch today at Fu Kee, the food is OK but the owner's customer service sucks. He is a one man show and seemingly over worked. He's too money hungry to get help. Which take away from his customer service."
2015-10-21,5.0,"Apex, NC",Mami Nora’s,"If you enjoy Rotisserie Chicken, you MUST go to Mami Nora's. Rotisserie Chicken hasn't been something I've found myself craving in the past, so I would normally just get my quick fix from the local Harris Teeter every now and then. But now that I've tried Mami Nora's I think I can foresee a lot more Rotisserie chicken in my future. The chicken here is absolute perfection. If you like a charred flavor, with fall off the bone type chicken, you will love this place. However, the sides could use some work. I recently tried the Yucca fries which were extremely dry and not edible in my opinion. The plantains were tasty, just cut too large, into oddly shaped chunks. There are plenty of other options for sides so I'm not going to let that stop me from coming back. I'll eventually try one of their ""made to order"" dishes once I get over this Rotisserie chicken obsession!"

2015-10-21,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Aladdin’s Eatery,I like Aladdins desserts... They are not cheap but worth it overall. The portions are medium sized.Some days they have more variety than on others... Tried their cheesecake and tiramisu on last visit and it was all yummy!!They do have vegan and gluten free options as well for the health conscious freaks.
2015-10-21,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Taverna Agora,"I love Taverna and was worried that their food and ambience would suffer when they moved downtown.   But they haven't missed a beat. The food is consistently above standard: fresh,quality ingredients,  well seasoned and prepared,  appropriate portion sizes and delicious.  Superbly  grilled meats, especially the lamb.  Can't wait for the cold weather menu when lamb shanks will be included on the special menu.  Many of the servers at the downtown location are new and still learning the profession, but any lapse in their service is more than made up by their courtesy  and enthusiasm."
2015-10-21,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Wicked Taco Raleigh,"Wicked Taco is just meh in my book. I came for a quick lunch as I saw some good reviews on Yelp and that they have a drive thru. This just made Wicked Taco all the more attractive when you need a quick lunch but don't want typical fast food. And I think that's the best way to describe it, it's an alternative to fast food but not a place I'd go for a sit-down meal. So my experience is based solely on their drive thru which was slow... very slow. I think it took a total of 20 minutes from the time we ordered, waited to drive up to the window to pay and get our food. And now that I think about it, we waited a solid 8 minutes for our food to be ready after we already paid. Maybe I'm spoiled with fast food but usually drive thru means you're suppose to get your food faster, right? I mean, don't get me wrong, I'd rather my food be fully cooked and correct but I'm hoping this is just some kinks they're still working out and not the normal experience. Additionally, I was really not pleased with their staff who I could clearly see through the window ignoring me when I first pulled up to the window and didn't come talk to me or ask for payment till a few minutes later after they finished putting stickers on their to-go boxes. It just really surprised me they'd put such small tasks above customer service. What saved Wicked Taco in my opinion was their food selection which was decent but the portions were smaller then I expected for the price. I ordered the Freddy Likes It Hot without the pineapple and really loved the flavors but just the one taco really wasn't enough, I'm glad I got the combo but it all left me wanting more. The guacamole really wasn't flavorful, it wasn't really guacamole in my opinion and merely resembled mashed avocados--no flavor sadly :(  My friends ordered other signature tacos and also thought the flavors were good but wanted more substance or bang for their buck (aka more food). Overall, if I'm in the mood for tacos and in the area, sure I'll swing by if I'm pressed for time; otherwise, I don't see myself coming back here. Wish I had a better experience but it just did not WOW me or stand out in any way for that matter."

2015-10-22,4.0,"Ventura, CA",The Mecca Restaurant,"A great place to experience ""Raleigh of Old"", have a great burger and a cold beer. From my first visit here a few years ago I've loved having a cold beer at the bar or bugler sitting in one of the booths. It feels incredible here. They say they opened in 1930, and hanging out here you can feel the years.As for the food, I love the burgers being cooked on a flat top, there's no better burger with lettuce and tomato. The spaghetti a nice hardy meat sauce with delicious spaghetti noddles, but was not impressed with the clam chowder as it was just too watery for me.I'll be back to try more dishes soon."
2015-10-22,5.0,"Carrboro, NC",Assaggio’s,Pasta dishes were delicious and I had leftovers (which almost never happens). With each pasta dish you get garlic knots and a side salad so for the price ($12-$15) this place is a steal.

I've had the duck empanadas, bacon and rabbit springrolls, mac and cheese, loaded tot burger and the regular burger. All fantastic. The house made chips are very flavorful, dark russet type chips, and come with an awesome tangy dipping sauce. Only thing is check out the draft menu before you go if that's what your hankering was for. First time I went was right after a sour and wild ale event and that's all that was on tap. Their bottled selection is impressive. Strangely enough, no hard ciders, not even craft."

This is semi fast food. Order at the counter, get your drink and a number. The salsa bar had 10 fresh mixes. A variety of bottled hot sauces are offered. The food was fast and delicious.  Yes, I will be back with my wife.  A lttle different, tasty and very good. Well done."
2015-10-22,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Godavari Indian Restaurant,"This was my first experience with fancy indian dining and all went decently well, but it was hard to suck up the high prices. You are paying for atmosphere here instead of value or high food quality. We ordered the mutton biryani, lamb vindaloo and chicken chettanad. Everything was well cooked but our food was so so so spicy even though we asked for it to be medium. I think they cooked the pepper into the vindaloo and chettanad for too long and it was barely edible, and I'm a capsaicin badass usually! On the other had we asked for Indian spicy biryani and that was just meh in spicy...disappointing. Everything tasted pretty good, but I prefer the restaurants at Chatham square in Cary and Kabab and curry, which both give you more for the money with better service. I will say that the vindaloo was excellently flavored. Perhaps it's the north Raleigh location standard price, but I won't be returning unless Im in the area because I was not wowed. Four stars for providing decent south indian food in north Raleigh, but I'd only come here if I were trying to impress a date or be fancy. Sadly did not fulfill my foodie high hopes. However, I do have friends who rave about the chicken tikka and go there basically every week, so tikka addicts should give it a try and post their impressions!"

The grilled chicken in the wrap was burnt tasting and chewy. We both could not eat it. The fries were great but that was about it. I think overpriced for low quality food."

2015-10-23,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Fu Kee Express,"Very good and freshly made Chinese take out. I've gotten the General Tso's for lunch a few times. It is a decent sized portion and just the right amount of spice (not too hot, but still let's you know it is there).The owner is very nice and does all the cooking himself. That is probably the main drawback, though, since he is a one man show. If he's cooking don't expect to get your order taken until he's done. It is worth the wait, but if you're short on time have a Plan B ready in case there are some others ahead of you."
2015-10-23,5.0,"Durham, NC",Bida Manda,"Wow! I was truly blown away by Bida Manda! I have been hearing such great things about this restaurant since I moved to the area and was finally able to try it out last night.Even on a Thursday night every table was taken so a reservation is a must! The service was top notch - the hostess asked us if we were celebrating any special occasion and went above and beyond explaining the menu since it was our first time dining there. Our waitress was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. I loved the bamboo backdrop, fun wallpaper, and dim lighting - perfect ambience for a girls night out or romantic date.I tried the Picaflor cocktail - it was so refreshing and a great accompaniment to the food that was to come. We started off with two appetizers - the crispy lettuce wraps and the veggie spring rolls. Both were tasty but the texture of the lettuce wraps was truly unique. Now onto the entrees - we wanted to try a few different things so ordered the sweet chili salmon & the chicken curry (which the chef split into two separate bowls for us). The salmon was perfectly cooked and seasoned, the chicken curry just spicy enough (took most of it home because had way too much food)! I can't wait to dine again at Bida Manda and try some of the other menu stand-outs like the Papaya Salad, Pork Belly Soup, & Ginger Pork Ribs."
2015-10-23,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Nashers Sandwich House,"We've now been here 3 times, and we've ordered different food every time. Its been between solid and delicious each time. The food is interesting, and not quite like anything you've had elsewhere. The fries are rock star. The sweet potato tots? Bloody outrageous. There's not a whole lot to complain about here, which is probably why we keep going back. I mean, it ain't good for ya, but it sure is tasty."

2015-10-23,4.0,"Phoenix, AZ",The Fiction Kitchen,"Fiction Kitchen is my favorite restaurant in Raleigh. The food is expertly crafted and the service is impeccable. Their menu doesn't vary much aside from the typical rotating specials (which are always delicious and always local) but they offer a strong lineup of familiar southern fare, along with a ripe selection of international dishes. I'm particularly fond of the 'tinga tacos' and the chicken and waffles (don't miss the house made hot sauce), but I've found myself reaching for my wife's curry bowl on more than one occasion. This place is typically packed and they don't  take reservations, so expect a wait during the peak hours. However, they flip tables quickly, and always keep the queue of regularly sized parties moving at a reasonable pace. The wait staff are always professional but casual. They know the menu inside and out, and are typically willing to work with you to accommodate any special requests you might have. Everyone I've ever been served by has been friendly, talkative and keep my glass full. I've proudly taken my omnivore friends and family here and everyone always leaves stuffed and satisfied. This place is not just for vegans and vegetarians."
2015-10-23,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bella Monica,"I am still baffled as to why so many people I know rave about this place and the food here. The great majority of the food is NOT fresh. Staff told me the cannoli shells come from a bakery in Virginia and the filling from Italy. The ""gravy"" is average. I've tried the pizza, ehhh. I've had several pasta dishes, and none were very good. Sauce on pasta dishes is always watery. The gluten free pizza is the same you buy at the grocery store, they just pop it in the oven. All in all some of the most underwhelming Italian food I've ever had."

2015-10-23,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Godavari Indian Restaurant,Excellent Indian food. Southern provinces is a slightly different flavor than the other Indian restaurants in the area-try something new-ask the owner for suggestions. Well worth trying-you will not be disappointed.
2015-10-23,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Station,"I want to like it. The patio is really lovely which is where the second star comes from. But they have certainly had long enough to get the food right at this point and it just isn't happening. I thought the issues at the beginning (could NOT get a pickle on a burger OR a CUBAN because ""theirs weren't ready"") would settle out in time but I have visited at least four more times most recently a couple of weeks ago and remain under impressed. The Bahn Mi was pure grease. I've had and enjoyed Bahn Mi many times and this version tasted like a lard sandwich. I think I'm done. Though I will certainly visit for a drink again. Also, agree with comments on the bar. It's not a very welcoming bunch. Though I did have a super nice server at a table last time I was there. Anyway... Next"
2015-10-23,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Buku,"Ordered a Cab to drink like it doesn't have  the Oakey taste. Ordered Baja crab Flautas and Chaat for Apeti. Very flavorful nice presentation mango and crab never tasted soon good 2 of my fav flav with that hot taste. For the main we got Argentinian Rib and Duck Adobo. The rib was soft with a pink just the way I like it. Has those vegetable and cheese grilled apparently it's called Tempey a protein meat substitute. The adobo was cooked 3 ways with duck egg, meat fried and cooked in soy sauce all on coconut rice and the atchara cleaned the palette....very good a must try. Server was very knowledgeable of the ingredients which is always a good sign in a restaurant. For dessert a Cap and halo halo not ur usual combination of dessert but a good taste on a fav dessert. I  don't think much of the guava syrup though but you don't really need it. A must try place if your at down town catching a Broadway or concerto."

Not a huge place so be wary if you're going with a big crowd as they don't have many waiters/waitresses on staff. However, the food was well worth it and the staff was very friendly and cordial.

2015-10-24,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Calavera Empanadas And Tequila,"Came back to  Calavera with my girlfriend this evening. Another employee was running expo and brought our empanadas to us. My girlfriend asked her for a soda and the woman snapped, ""You'll have to order that through your server."" I thought that was incredibly rude. That woman should've either gotten my girlfriend her soda, or told our waitress real quick that we needed something. Maybe if our server could be bothered to, I don't know, actually bring us our food, then we would not have had to ask some other employee for something. It was a soda, not something really complicated. It's also a small restaurant, and they weren't that busy. Just plain rudeness and laziness!Okay, so it seems to be that the service here will be just God Awful. Whatever, fine. Back in May I said I'd put up with crappy service to get great food. But I will not put up with crappy service for crappy food. Tonight the food was a swing and a miss. I saw something on the menu I didn't notice, empanada al pastor. Okay, I'll try it, I thought. Al Pastor is supposed to have pineapple in it. I didn't taste or see any pineapple, though. You don't get to just call something Al Pastor if it isn't Al Pastor. Just like McDonald's doesn't get to say their burgers are filet mignon.It's to the point where I think, ""okay, I'll go to Calavera, but what will be the problem tonight?"" If the service is this awful, the food better be perfect. Since it's at that point, this place is not worth my time or money."

2015-10-24,5.0,"Asheville, NC",Death & Taxes,"Nothing in life is certain except death and taxes.  For us we also certainly had a wonderful meal!  On point would be my best description of this restaurant.  The service was so personal and well timed that it seemed the staff appeared and disappeared based on our thoughts.  Plates arrived in just the right order and with perfect timing between courses.  Everything just worked like clockwork and I really can't praise the staff more.  The food is mostly small plates with a few mains.  Everything was really well seasoned, cooked to perfection and hard to beat.  Highlights were the most tender octopus I've ever had and chicken more flavorful than any I've ever had that wasn't wrapped in pig.  I could have gone with a little more fire flavor on the mushrooms and we longed for more creamed kohlrabi than a smear on the side but these were small issues and easily overshadowed by the great food and stellar service."

It's silly that it's taken me so long - it's pretty close to where I live.Soo Cafe is known for their fried chicken, so I went for the tenders in the SOGA (soy-garlic) sauce. My husband ordered beef bulgogi. The menu states that the chicken takes extra time, so the bulgogi dish came out a few minutes ahead of the chicken. The plate was huge and the bulgogi was spicy and delicious - definitely rivaled Seoul Garden! My chicken arrived and it was definitely freshly made and piping hot! The chicken was tender and perfectly cooked. The fry was crispy, but did not overtake the chicken in anyway. The sauce was awesome - flavorful and spicy! They have other sauces and I hope the try them all, but it will be difficult for me to NOT order the SOGA sauce. I highly recommend Soo Cafe. I cannot wait for my next visit!"

I was dining with my husband and a dear friend, who can be a bit loquacious, and she handled all of us with grace. Our food was amazing. We started with hummus and the chili. Both were exceptional. My companions ate the burger special and the chicken appetizer. But my greatest joy, next to Shannon, was my salad with arugula, warmed pecans, goat cheese, macerated blueberries, and the grilled portabella. I am always amazed how great the food is at our local neighborhood spot. Above and beyond, I highly recommend that you sit in Shannon's section. She will offer impeccable service and is ever so patient, efficient, and graceful at her job."
2015-10-24,5.0,"Chesterfield Court House, VA",Trophy Brewing Company,"On a family vacation to Nashville, we had a waitress who once lived in Raleigh rave about this place, so we had to try it. Kind of a neat place, with mostly outdoor seating, and obviously very popular as it was packed. We got there at 6:20, and were able to find a seat inside. It's also a craft brewery, so they have a half dozen or so unique draft beers. They let you try free samples to figure out which one you like, which was nice. Southern Trophy was the best. They have a pretty good specialty pizza menu, with a lot of interesting ingredients. We went with one of the specials of the week, a Greek pizza. And that was the high point of our visit.We sat at our table at 6:20, and our server was there in a couple minutes, we sampled a few beers and then ordered drinks. He stopped back a couple times, and we ordered the pizza about 6:30. About 7, our waiter stops by with a couple of beer samples that we had not tried, and says they're really busy tonight, pizza should be up shortly. At 7:15, the waiter comes by with a Nut Trophy appetizer, on the house, and says they've had a ""malfunction"" and our pizza will be the second one coming up. At 7:30, after watching at least a dozen pizzas set on the pick up shelf by the kitchen and taken away by waiters (not ours), my daughter caught our waiter and the manager to find out what was going on. She was told it would be a couple more minutes, and there would be no charge for the pizza. At 7:35 we told our waiter to go ahead and run our check, and make the pizza to go. We were tired of watching people come in and pick up carry out pizzas, or sit down after we had, and get their food. We walked out of the restaurant with our fresh pizza in a box at 8pm.  So we ate the pizza at my daughters apartment, and it was very good. The pizza is easily 4-5 stars. But service was 1-2 on this particular night. As we're walking out the door with the pizza in a box, the Manager finally walks over and apologizes, and hopes we'll give them another try. But at no time did the waiter or  Manager give us an explanation as to what happened. I guess it was just that ""malfunction"". But what I think happened is either our waiter forgot to put the order in the system, or the ticket was lost by the kitchen. Either way, it was not handled well."
2015-10-24,4.0,"Fayetteville, NC",Monapita Mediterranean Grill,Amazing! This place is a MUST try. I would recommend anything and everything on their menu. I had the chicken shawarma sandwich and my husband had the chicken platter. Another plus is the family that owns the place are so friendly
2015-10-25,3.5,"Goldsboro, NC",Jimmy V’s Osteria & Bar,"I have to say this place is so honorable. Jimmy V speaks for himself and this place definitely carries on his tradition. Our waitress Kelly was so professional and knowledgable it made the place more inviting. The atmosphere was very artistic and the place settings made it look high scale. Prices were great no matter what you chose from the menu. I started off with calamari, then ate an entire Jimmy V pizza, and finished it off with an amazing Cannoli. Every item was perfectly cook. Kelly was always there to answer any questions and always had my drink topped off. It was such a great experience I even talked to the manager to let him know how impressed I was. Will definitely go again, and with family and friends. Highly suggest this place for dates, friend gatherings, and/or family. And again, ask for Kelly. She does an amazing job. If I had it my way she would be the role model of what a perfect waitress is and I would implement her with training her peers and subordinates.  Plus a certain percentage goes to the Jimmy V foundation. That says it all."
2015-10-25,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Red Pepper Asian,"A really good Chinese restaurant in East Raleigh Considering that much of this area is filled with walmarts, chain restaurants and general sketchiness, I was shocked to find this place. Don't be deterred by the strip mall location-it's actually really cute inside and the food is awesome.Confession: I'm not generally a big fan of Chinese food (well, the Americanized Chinese food anyway. I'm sure Chinese food in China probably doesn't taste like what I'm used to). For years, I wouldn't eat it at all. That changed after discovering Restaurants that have both an American menu and a 'traditional' menu. Red Pepper is one such place. I got the ma po tofu (a dish that's hard to find at many Chinese restaurants here). It was delicious and had a slight spicy kick (though not super hot so you don't necessarily need to avoid this dish if you're not a spicy food fan). At ten bucks for a huge serving, the price was right too. If you're not a fan of the typical American Chinese fare with tons of grease and sickly sweet sauces, give this place a try instead!"

2015-10-25,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Mecca Restaurant,"The family-run Mecca Restaurant has been at 13 E. Martin since 1937, and in downtown Raleigh since 1930. In the 50s, the upstairs opened. In 2009, the late night menu was added, which introduced many more people - including me - to the historic diner.As a tall guy, I struggle with the legroom at the bar, booths, and the low ceiling by the stairs. But, it's hard to recommend any changes. This is the only old school restaurant of its kind in the middle of downtown. If you want to go on a downtown Raleigh old school tour, the only other stops are The Roast Grill (1940), Char-Grill (1959), and Finch's (1945).The star of Mecca's menu is their jumbo hamburger, which is served on a fantastic sesame seed bun - perhaps the best bun at any burger joint downtown. It's a classic burger, and definitely has a spot in my top 5 Triangle area burgers. You get a handful of fries with the burger, a small portion by today's standards. But, I don't think that much has changed since it was first served in 1958. They probably use the same plates too!Beyond the burgers, there's a full selection of sandwiches. Eastern NC BBQ is also popular here, and it's slow-cooked in-house."

2015-10-25,5.0,"Apex, NC",Centro,"As a precursor to seeing Interstellar at the nearby IMAX, we hopped into Centro for an early dinner as they opened.  I had stopped in for lunch a few times, and was always pleased,  but it had been a while since I'd had dinner there.  First, the Mojito's were well done and really kicked off the meal.  Second, our waitress Christina was energetic and made really good recommendations when I was debating between selections.  Third, the food - we had the Tamales de la Casa, Steak Tamal, Tacos Meros and the dinner special for that evening.  Yes, by the end of the meal we realized it was a bit too much but it carries well!   Overall, my favorite were the Tamales, which if done as 2 orders, would have been the perfect appetizer rounded out by the same as my meal.  Other good plays are Frijolada and Mole Poblano.  :) For downtown Raleigh, Centro is one of my favorite dining places. Yes, the prices are on nearing the upper end of the scale but with gluten-free options, it remains one of the best places near the IMAX to dine before or after a showing.  Reservations are not accepted but you can call ahead up to 30 minutes prior to be listed."
2015-10-25,5.0,"Apex, NC",Calavera Empanadas And Tequila,"Came to this cute little spot after the North Carolina State Fair. My friend said someone highly recommended this place. There's a parking deck connected to the building, apparently free on the weekends. As we enter, we pretty much just saw the bar and a few high tables. They were also a few picnic tables outside on the sidewalk. You really can't beat the empanadas for only 3.50. I ordered the chicken mole and especially liked the texture of the crust. It also came with some red and green salsa. My friend and I split the nachos covered with pulled pork which was seasoned very well and tender. There were three TVs upstairs in the dining area and the decor was very quaint. Very clean restaurant with excellent service. We went on a Saturday afternoon around 12:30 and there was no wait."

2015-10-25,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Neomonde Bakery & Deli,"Fresh and delicious, particularly the huge array of house made salads and sides available with the meal. The only downside is the pita bread, which tends to be a bit dry, and the often long lines and wait for food."
2015-10-25,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",First Watch,"Only been there once, but the menu has potential and I liked the look of the place, so will be back. I had the eggs benedict, which was average at best. But perhaps their healthy menu focus will net some good recipes worth trying. I'll give it another try."
2015-10-25,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",First Watch,This place is my new go to breakfast joint. I've had three amazing meals already. Look at their omelet selection and you can't go wrong. My son had the fall breakfast special with pumpkin spiced pancakes. I hate hat kind of stuff and it was amazing. Great owner/manager as well. Took my parents back last week. Glad I decided to walk in.
2015-10-25,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Firebirds Wood Fired Grill,One of the best steaks I've ever had .. So final meal before execution lobster queso to start peppercorn sirloin blue cheese style with either green chile mac and cheese or mashed potatoes and for dessert creme brûlée cheese cake add some wine and you have just had the best night of your life lol but seriously pretty amazing meal and if your feeling extra peckish your can order a side of button mushrooms with your meal just for fun best mushrooms ever !!
2015-10-25,5.0,"Melbourne, FL",Gino’s Pizza,"I ordered pizza from Gino's for delivery and the pizza was so chewy! Talk about a jaw workout. The flavor wasn't terrible, but I was surprised this place was rated so highly. Maybe I ordered from them on an off day...I probably won't give them another try though."
2015-10-25,4.0,"Durham, NC",Lynnwood Grill & Brewing Concern,"Stopped by Lynwood Grill for appetizers and a drink on a Saturday afternoon. We were seated on the rooftop which was perfect on a surprisingly warm October day. Unfortunately the rooftop scenery was the best part of the meal. We tried the nachos, spinach & artichoke dip, and pretzels all of which were mediocre at best. My friend also had the black bean burger which had a weird texture to it. Service was good but will likely be trying a new restaurant for bar food in the future!"
2015-10-25,3.0,"Durham, NC",Seoul Garden Restaurant,"Came here with friends for a birthday, and it was the best Korean food experience I have ever had. I ordered the chicken bulgogi, and had a fair share of beef bulgogi, and korean fried chicken with the group. Food was just right on the level of spice, and the side dishes were on point. There were no regrets for coming here.Sam (im assuming the owner), and our waiter were amazing company, you can tell that they cared about their guest and wanted everyone to enjoy the visit.Thank you Sam for the amazing food, and keeping en eye on us that so we had the best experience. I am sure to visit again."
2015-10-25,5.0,"Carrboro, NC",Gravy,"This was an overall disappointing experience. I ordered Eggplant Pie, which was not actually eggplant pie, it was just eggplant parm. It didn't even come with pasta. My BF got gnocchi and was also disappointed. It was very bland."
2015-10-25,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Big Ed’s North,"I was super excited to hear Big Ed's was opening a location in North Raleigh. I've been to the City Market location a few time before and enjoyed the food. I decided to have my family meet there this morning for a nice breakfast after a weekend of wedding festivities. Knowing both locations are quite busy, my boyfriend and I arrived 20 minutes early to get a table for everyone. We were greeted by 2 incredibly rude women who were working the cash register and ""directing/greeting"" patrons as they walked in. If you have ever been to this location, you know the entrance is small. One of the women repeatedly herded patrons to crunch in so the door could be closed. The other woman at the register barked at a patron when he ""crossed the twine rope"" which separated the incoming from the outgoing. While I understand the purpose of their instruction, their delivery was of incredibly poor taste. There were 4 patrons that left due to their rude and disrespectful nature. I can assure you I would have been another to leave, had I not had family meeting me from out of town. Both women encouraged each other's poor behavior even after the patrons left stating ""I ain't got time for this. I got to move 'em in and move 'em out"" and ""that WAS being nice for me"". I hope the management at this establishment provides the re-education it appears their staff is in desperate need of. The food was fine, but I can scramble my own eggs at home and be spoken to with a great deal more respect."
2015-10-25,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",First Watch,Holy Montecristo !! So this place is really cute has a kinda rustic vibe a lot of wooden and metal accents the staff is always nice and friendly so let's get to it the best thing I've had by far is the Montecristo Sandwich  sourdough French Toast with ham and turkey Swiss Dijon mustard topped with powder sugar and a raspberry preserve its like a party in yo mouth lol seriously though I get sad anytime I go and try something different not that the other items aren't good bc they are but there just not a French toast sandwich I've also tried a egg in a basket really delicious and savory I would just add a side of potatoes to make a fuller meal it's a lighter option in my opinion also the kale tonic is very refreshing so this is a great casual brunch spot in my opinion !
2015-10-25,3.0,"Clayton, NC",Jimmy V’s Osteria & Bar,"This restaurant is my husband and my favorite restaurant. When you go, you must ask for Kelly as she provides exceptional service. The food is amazing and not over priced as some other reviewers might have you think. The quality and taste of the food is top notch. This a five star rated restaurant."
2015-10-25,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Poole’s Downtown Diner,Neat atmosphere and great service but the food was not worth the hype or price.  The sides were much better than the entrees.  Mac and cheese and the Brussel sprouts were fantastic.  Scallops were average and the pot pie could have been from the freezer and reheated for all we know.  Cocktails were great and reasonably priced.  It's worth a single trip but not a return trip.
2015-10-25,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Yard House,"Our niece wanted her Birthday celebration at the Yard House. We were a group of 16 but 18.5 showed up. We had to go around looking for chairs,. We finally had to asked for any type of accommodation for the baby in our group and they brought us a stand.  I can't tell you what  more than half the group ordered but I can tell you that about some meals. Cuban sandwich was ok and the BBQ bacon cheddar burger was ok also, etc... In general, our thoughts about the food and service were moderate. The drinks were a bit pricey though"
2015-10-25,5.0,"Apex, NC",The Fiction Kitchen,"Been on the to-do list for a while and we finally made it after seeing ""The Martian"" at the nearby IMAX.  (That's an enjoyable film too btw...)  We arrived around 17:30 on a Saturday and had about 45 minute wait - not bad considering they hold maybe 50 - 75 people max.   We opted for the first open seating which was at the bar.  There were many other people waiting and surprisingly I saw several families with smaller kids - awesome!   I always enjoy barring it b/c the bar keeps are engaging and provide an added incentive to pay attention to what they are selecting from the top-grade shelving behind them.   It's fun to figure out what they might be mixing and of course the more of those for you, the more fun it becomes!   For drinks (and dessert),  we had the Granddaddy Blackbird(s), a pumpernickel hatchback, and a cosmic mulligan.  All of these are most excellent choices.  I enjoyed the Grandaddy Blackbirds the most!  :)  For an appetizer we spied the ""Bread + Spread"" (gluten free) cornbread with the sides being the locally made pimento cheese and onion spreads - wow.. that was nice.  I'm generally not a pimento cheese fan but that was *@*@ good.  For the mains we opted into the ""NC Peanut Noodle Bowl""  Be forewarned, this is quite a serving which was the most awesome combination of flavors with perfectly cooked noodles!   For the 2nd main, we selected or the ""Succotash Risotto with the quinoa option"" as gluten free  Both of these were well prepared, well presented and highly recommended. The service was spot on, the location is easy to reach and parking, which can often be hard to do in downtown Raleigh, was really easy.  Highly recommend if you want a great gluten-free meal while in downtown Raleigh - seek The Fiction Kitchen!  Will be returning again soon."
2015-10-25,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Relish Café & Bar,I've eaten here twice already. Cozy atmosphere and nice clientele. Shrimp and Grits dish is still my favorite.
2015-10-25,3.0,"Seattle, WA",Buku,"What originally drew me to Buku was seeing a photo of their seasonal arepa dish on Yelp. Even though, as I came to find out, that they do not have arepas anymore, they still have a lot other great food to choose from.Came here on a Sunday night. It was most likely emptier than usual since the North Carolina State Fair was in town. Wanting to balance out my dinner, I decided to get a Ginger Pear Salad and their Baja Crab Flautas.The salad was really good - a healthy amount of dressing and plenty of fresh toppings including pears, almonds, edamame and carrots. The flautas were also pretty good, but I expected more. It was pretty much crab and cream cheese - I expected a little more of something, but it was still tasty.If you're in Raleigh and find yourself with Asian food cravings, swing by Buku!"
2015-10-25,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Poole’s Downtown Diner,Mac and cheese!!! It's all I have to say. It's a must when you go here! It's big enough for the table... but it's so good you might want to get you own. Menu varies so its not the same every time! Food was good although I thought the portions were slightly small and over priced. I found it weird that the menu was on the wall so you have to get up to read the menu. The place felt really relaxed.
2015-10-25,4.0,"Manhattan, NY",Flying Burrito,"First time back since they were in that Travel Channel show, but I think it's gotten better. The sweet potato fries with apple butter was amazing as always and the chips/salsa flow never subsided. The vegetarian options were great (my wife got the veggie tacos). I got the Ultimate Porker with extra jalapenos. It was fantastic, the meat was moist and not overly cooked, and the jalapenos were the perfect touch. You can't go wrong with this place. Plus, I hear they might be installing corn hole sets soon for the customers."
2015-10-25,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Coquette Brasserie,"Excellent French cuisine with an atmosphere to match. The doors were thrown open wide last week with the fall air. We got the Coq au Vin and beef bourguignon, both rich and well-portioned, and the spinach salad with a poached egg actually made me wish I had more salad. The timing on wine was a bit off (we ordered, and the second bottle didn't show until dessert, but it happens), but overall, everything was delicious, good service...we're looking for any good occasion to return!"
2015-10-25,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Wicked Taco Raleigh,"Disappointing food and awkward service. The queso was a hardened glob of cheese that may or may not have come out of a can, poorly constructed tacos with extremely wet and runny toppings which made the whole thing soggy and unappealing, and mediocre salsa bar. I also ordered and paid for a beer that was advertised, then found out too late that it was out of stock."
2015-10-25,4.0,"Greensboro, NC",Buku,"So many delicious items on the menu. I decided on the pork belly ramen. OMG!! The broth was exquisite, not too salty, the broken yolk of the egg on top made the broth rich beyond belief. the noodles were light but firm. The pork belly didn't overwhelm the dish, but you knew it was there. I ate every drop. I will most certainly return."
2015-10-25,4.0,"Whitsett, NC",Godavari Indian Restaurant,Awesome place. We loved the food and the variety of dishes they carry. Food was tasty and service was great.
2015-10-25,2.0,"Clayton, NC",Kamado Grille,This restaurant is amazing. The food is top notch and there is such a great selection to choose from. You order via iPad as you please so the food comes very quickly. The food is AMAZING cooked on the grill and all the desserts are made from scratch. The atmosphere is so fun and unique. I definitely would rate this restaurant as five stars. You will not be disappointed.
2015-10-25,5.0,"Clayton, NC",Taverna Agora,"This place is beautiful, the staff is so kind, but the food was just okay. 4 stars still because I enjoyed my time there so much. Wish they had more veggie options too! Get a table on the rooftop!"
2015-10-25,4.0,"Oakland, CA",Buku,"Global street food....looked good, but hey, I'm from the Bay Area and I'm in Raleigh, NC - so hopeful but wary.  Our wariness was quickly quelled.  Starting with friendly staff and ending with a great wine flight offering of terrific Spanish wines, we were so happy with our food that we came back the next day to again catch another late lunch.  Huge plus that they are open straight from opening to closing, so catching a late lunch was not a problem.  On our two visits, we had Buku edamame (interesting with the addition of sesame oil), Ginger Pear Salad (excellent), Baja Crab Flautas (to die for if your ready for a little indulgence), Vegetable Dumplings (very good), Pork Belly Ramen (also very good), and the Buku Hot Pot (out of this world good).  The only disappointment was the Buku roll and it was still acceptable  (we were looking for more heat and better nori wrap).  I didn't try any of the East Indian offerings, only because the Bay Area has Vik's Chaat House - arguably the best Indian street food in the US.  It's not getting more than 4 stars only due to the sushi offering....eat here, you will love it!"
2015-10-25,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Raleigh Times Bar,Went for brunch wasn't impressed at all with the service. The portion sizes for the prices are sub par. I ordered the Korean beef tacos and they were ok. Nothing I would go out of the way for. Small sides.
2015-10-25,1.0,"Greensboro, NC",Raleigh Times Bar,"400+ reviews so I will try to get to the point. I have been maybe five times over a number of years. I had a friend fly into Raleigh for work and we ended up here. The ""Yes, let's go to Raleigh Times"":1)Excellent beer selection of 80+ craft. Their menu is separated well and would compare to a brewery in this regards. You could zero in on something if the number to look through is overwhelming. Beer nerds rejoice. 2)People have talked about the rooftop. Yes this is pretty cool however not unique. Greensboro has two venues that sport a rooftop patio. These would be Greene Street and M'Couls.  I have been in major cities that have these too. But this is a cool thing and when the weather is nice, it would work. It did last night. If I ever return, I would immediately bypass all the other areas and come straight here. The ""I want to go somewhere else"":Other reviewers have mentioned the crowd on a weekend night. *nods in agreement*I feel like this place is maybe too big for its britches. It is a hotspot and pulls people for whatever appeal that it has. It has a reputation I guess is what I am trying to say. It got way too crowded and loud by about 9 pm and wasn't somewhere I wanted to be for more than a couple of hours. Service got slower and almost nonexistent. I would come here on a weekday night and avoid this mess. I am glad we didn't order food as we were not there long enough to hit the munchie feeling. We left because of this. I get the appeal of the place or whatever and I can see why it draws a crowd. But you would not catch me here on a weekend night again."
2015-10-26,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Zoës Kitchen,"I absolutely love the food at this place which is why I continue to frequent it.  The food is very tasty and healthy but I will only give it three stars because I have had consistently bad bad service here with absolutely no apology and the only reason I continue to frequent it besides the good food is that it is so close to my house. There is another one that is located pretty close to NC State on Oberlin Road and it is fabulous. The service is excellent, the food is always consistently prepared and there are no problems there which is how I cannot understand why this one has so many problems. At this location I've gotten chicken with lots of gristle a few times; several very late orders, rude staff at cash register actively complaining about their job to me, and absolutely no apology ever. I even wrote a note to the corporate headquarters with no response which was really disappointing because I really like the food at this place and the other location is great. Tonight I waited 20 minutes for my order of takeout greek salad with chicken and steak kebabs. While I know it takes a little while to prepare the kebabs and I am not an impatient person it bothered me that the young man who brought me the wrong order first failed to mention that they must have forgotten my order and two other people who came in after me were done and left well before the time I got mine. Additionally I was the only person left in the store. Ugh!"
2015-10-26,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar,"Unique concept. Decent execution. Met expectation.I have previously stopped here and 'tried' to get a bite to eat; all three times I was told it would've been more than an hour of wait. You may say I am impatient, and you may say I'm a bit snobbish, but no burger nor sushi nor the literal combination of both should keep me in hunger for an hour.Apparently this place is always busy, except Sunday night at 8:45 PM. Take note of that because that was the only time I walk through the door and actually sought to be seated almost immediately, outside on the patio, with low 60s brisk.Now that I have been here and tasted more than two meals and in three different time frame--busy lunch 12-1p, busy dinner 6-8p, late dinner 8:30-10p--I would say that the service is consistent, not attentive, but consistent (to the size of the lunch/dinner crowd.)The sushi menu is what you would expected, and similar can be found elsewhere; the combination of sushi choices and classic burgers/sandwiches combine to form some out-of-the-box items. The creative menu wow'd me more than the food themselves, maybe because the high expectation I've held on this place. ***Would Recommend*** but only to folks who are looking for a place that satisfy the carnivore in the guys and dainty fancy in the gals, all under one roof. If you are looking for sushi rolls OR burgers, there are certainly better choices, and there are two right across Six Forks Rd."
2015-10-26,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Neomonde Bakery & Deli,"Neomonde Bakery & Deli has the best Mediterranean cuisine in Raleigh. We used them for our wedding and guests could not stop raving about them. Their service on-site was awesome as well. The only complaint I had was that the catering manager was a little slow with email. I would have liked better responsiveness and attention to detail in the days leading up to the wedding, but honestly, several catering managers I had interviewed for my wedding weren't much better. At the end of the day, the food was incredible and they did an awesome job cleaning up after the wedding. I couldn't ask for a better wedding caterer on the day-of."
2015-10-26,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kai Sushi and Sake Bar,"A Lunch favorite! The Screaming O and Piano Rolls are top of the list, as well as their Hibachi Combos (comes with salad, miso soup, edamame, fried rice, and choice of meat). If you like Sono downtown, this place has the same special rolls menu (I think the chefs are close friends). Be sure to ask the waitstaff for a fork if you need one though, it doesn't come with your food automatically.  The 3 or 5 roll specials are really good if you're ordering special rolls!  Awesome place for hibachi, japanese and sushi!"
2015-10-26,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",DeMo’s Pizzeria & Deli,"Out having dinner with the family so we decided on having pizza. Tried this place for the first time and Oh boy this place right here did not disappointment and you can take it from somebody all da way from Brooklyn, NY that knows good pizza. My son had to Philly cheesesteak , my wife had the buffalo wings and I was happy getting a large pie with extra cheese and pepperoni. I would have posted more pictures but they ate the food too fast and I couldn't keep up with them. From the head nods I could tell that DeMo's hit the spot. We will definitely be back. They even have Boars Head brisket pastrami which I can see myself buying by the ton. I never would have thought to find a little piece of Bklyn right here in Raleigh."
2015-10-26,3.0,"Georgetown, Washington, DC",Sardi’s Den,Cosmo made with orange stolis was awesome! Prime rib sandwich was amazing! And omg the 'homemade' pumpkin cheesecake was beyond delicious. We are ordering a whole cake next week. Awesome place!
2015-10-26,5.0,"Cary, NC",Big Ed’s City Market Restaurant,"Big Ed's Restaurant in Raleigh, NC is a showcase of Goodness Grows in North Carolina and a tribute to Southern Cuisine. Locals and tourists like the authentic Southern fare because is made with fresh local ingredients, prepared well, and served hot.  Pork Chop day is a special you need to enjoy because they are delicious and the service is quick and friendly."
2015-10-26,5.0,"New London, NC",Taverna Agora,"Great food and service! Sat at the bar and enjoyed a Gyro Platter! Delish!I was eating alone, but never felt uncomfortable!"
2015-10-27,3.5,"Cary, NC",Midtown Grille,"I have set up team dinners at Midtown and love their private room in the back of the restaurant. There is ample seating, glass doors, and a tv that is great for presentations or family functions with picture slideshows.  The food and service have always impressed me and I love having Midtown to choose from amongst all the other North Hills options. Since this is not a chain, I gravitate towards Midtown because of their fresh menu with local ingredients and attention to detail. Most recently, I had brunch on a Sunday and it is served 10am to 3pm and therefore no dinner on Sundays. I had the Midtown Omelette with local ham, gouda cheese and fresh vegetables. The home fries were made with carmelized onions and a very tasty side. Before the omelettes were brought out, we started with two warm blueberry muffins and fresh whipped cream butter. It was a decadent way to start the morning. We also had to try the Beignets and you have to order these whilst dining at Midtown. Six hot-melt-in-your mouth pastries covered in powdered sugar are the perfect way to end your meal. The Beignets are accompanied with a raspberry sauce, an espresso sauce and also a caramel sauce. The raspberry is the best one and you are sure to leave powdered sugar on the table after sampling these yummy desserts. You can make reservations on opentable and I highly recommend Midtown for a nice lunch, dinner or brunch in the North Hills complex."
2015-10-27,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Donatos Raleigh,"Donatos is my choice for take-out pizza. Their online ordering is easy to use and lets you customize your pizza however you want. If you're on their email list they send out coupons fairly regularly.As for this specific location, I have always had friendly, quick service when picking up my order (and placing it as well if I'm down that way). We generally get the gluten free crust. They use Udi's which is good and doesn't taste gluten free. I've had it other places where it wasn't as good as Donato's. There is an upcharge for the GF, but they don't charge you an arm and a leg for it like some other places do. We've also tried a couple of the side salads which were a decent size for the price."
2015-10-27,4.0,"Cary, NC",Taza Grill,Best Mediterranean food in Raleigh!    Their lamb gyro is hands down the best.
2015-10-27,2.0,"Morrisville, NC",Clockwork,"Love this swanky little place on Glenwood! The interior of Clockwork is a wonderful mix of eccentric decor, bold colors and posh vibes. The bartenders here really know how to make their cocktails, the same which can't be said of many other places in the area. This seems to be a great date spot as I've seen numerous couples here and one of my friends has personally taken a date here as well. The music can be very clubby and loud on when I've been on weekends, though there isn't really a dance floor or area, which is a bit of a shame. Also, the front section of this bar also pulls up like a garage, so it's great for some fresh air on those cool autumn days and gives this place a little bit of fresh air. I wish they did a chiller jazz night, I feel like this would be the perfect venue for that."
2015-10-27,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Taste Small Plates | Wine Bar,"Taste has some pretty awesome dishes and lots of wine options.  If you go there definitely get the Jalapeno popper.  You won't be disappointed.   Despite the name, the main focus is on the pork belly with cashew butter that comes with it.  By far one of the best dishes I've ever had, cooked to perfection!  The staff is extremely friendly and even let us taste some wine options, despite us both getting beer.  The location isn't the best with it being somewhat out of the way and you probably wouldn't even notice it as you drove past.  Besides the poor location, the interior is nice and trendy with patio seating as well.  This place is an awesome retreat from downtown raleigh restaurants and is a great place for a date!"
2015-10-27,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Neomonde Bakery & Deli,"Honestly, this is one of my favorite places in the WORLD. So healthy, so FRESH - just everything you'd expect that a reputable family owned business would be. I haven't encountered a time yet where I was disappointed with the food, and for the most part the friendly service. There is an employee who seems really flustered and works in the front and gives off a indifferent vibe. Otherwise, the place is fantastic and serves the community well."
2015-10-27,3.0,"Blacksburg, VA",Ole Time Barbecue,"First, I was hopeful after reading reviews. I travel all over the southeast and eat at just about any BBQ joint I can find. Place is cool looking on inside, just old and rustic like a BBQ joint should be. People were nice. Food was reasonably priced for BBQ. That's all the good I got on this place. Do not order ribs. They must be boiled and not smoked at all. Looked and tasted like processed meat. Ate one rib and threw the rest away. Really the worse ribs I have ever tasted. Beans were ok. I don't know about other stuff on menu, but anyone will tell you if they can't do ribs right, then they can't do BBQ."
2015-10-27,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gringo A Go-Go,"Locals, this is the old Biscuit Station on Person (which I loved by the way). To be honest, it doesn't look that amazing from the outside. And there is that silver tinsel all around the bar. But once you get past that, this place is awesome. All the staff were very nice and service was quick. We ordered salsa and chips - you get to pick two salsas, from mild to very hot. And the chips are fresh and homemade. My kind of place. We also ordered guacamole. And it is was super FRESH and yummilicious. The margarita was strong and perfectly made as well. We also had entrees, which were great and came with two more salsas, but it couldn't have gotten any better so why keep typing. Vegetarians - YES place! Carnivores - also a yes place, but lesser a concern of mine. Parking is very limited so be careful.Looking forward to many future visits"
2015-10-27,4.0,"Durham, NC",Pho Vietnam,"I should of written a review a long time ago but here goes...Ever since this place opened up, my boyfriend and I have been regulars there. Their Pho soup is amazing. Something I would definitely compare to very authentic Vietnamese soup that I had in California. Maybe even a tad bit better! Their BBQ pork Bahn Minh is amazing too. So is the Lemongrass Chicken if you want something spicy. All their vermicelli bowls are very good and super healthy. The smoothies are great too. I get the avocado one with boba. Don't be afraid to try these little dark jelly balls haha they will change your life. Overall I can hands down say I come here a couple times a week. Lunch is packed and all other times there is a steady flow of people throughout the day. I'm so happy this little hole in the wall business is thriving so well. Plus they have the grand Asia market across the street which is where they probably get all their fresh food.I can rant all day about how great this place is!!! I've tried tons of Vietnamese places around here and this one is #1."
2015-10-27,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Another Broken Egg Cafe,"Delicious breakfast food! Really delicious. I had the sweet potato pancakes with eggs and potatoes.... oh my gosh, it was like the holidays in each bite (sweet potato pancake had orange zest, pecans, and some sort of cinnamon maple glaze on top). They ACTUALLY cook the eggs like you request, and the potatoes were pretty tasty also. The only but I have is that it took forever for our food to come out- probably 20-25 minutes, and the restaurant was not very busy. I mentioned this to our server, who agreed and spoke with the manager. The manager on duty was very apologetic and handled the situation very well. We will certainly go back and give it another try with the gift card she gave us."
2015-10-27,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Remedy Diner,"Always excellent service, spacious patio where dogs are welcome. Love the Zoobee salad, which is not vegetarian. The fake bbq sandwich is super yummy. The seasonal mixed drinks are my favorite thing. The desserts are homemade by the owner's (manager's?) mom. The vegan chocolate cake gives me life.They display local artists and switch the art out frequently - a concept I love. BUT sometimes the art is too edgy and puts me off my food. I had to deduct a star for that and the fact that the food is exceedingly slowly prepared. Don't go if you're in a hurry."
2015-10-27,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mami Nora’s,"Best roasted chicken I've ever eaten at a place like this. Portion sizes are huge! Can and will share a plate in the future. I ordered the 1/4 dark chicken plate with coleslaw and fries. I also tried the purple corn and spice drink which was delicious. The sauces were superb as well. Had to take a late lunch and arrived around 2 PM, which was perfect because there was barely a line and the lunch rush was over."
2015-10-27,5.0,"Durham, NC",Tazza Kitchen Cameron Village,"So my experience at Tazza was very disappointing! I will start off with the positives: 1) the customer service was great, the server was attentive, friendly and even comped the chicken on my salad (I will explain later why she did this)2) the decor is cute and cleanNow for the negatives:1) I ordered the spinach and apple salad with chicken. The salad was nothing special and my chicken was EXTREMELY over cooked making it taste like old rubber. I picked out all the chicken and left it on a plate, hence why it was comped! 2) I also ordered a side of beets which were flavorless and watered down- it was a very unpleasant taste. My friend ordered the butternut squash as a side and I was quite underwhelmed.I expected way more considering how fresh and delicious the description of the items sounded but unfortunately as of now I won't be returning!"
2015-10-27,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Lynnwood Grill & Brewing Concern,"Lynnwood is an enigma to me.  By far the BEST brewery in Raleigh, but has a sports bar interior with rowdy patrons.  If it weren't for the great beer, I don't think I would frequent this place as much.  Their IPAs, like Hubris, are some of the best I've ever tasted.  Plenty of TVs to watch during football season and has pretty decent bar food.  The mozzarella  sticks are super addictive!  The staff is extremely nice and attentive despite them being busy a majority of the time they are open.  Has a really cool patio bar area on the roof that is a great place to hang out if the weather is nice."
2015-10-27,2.0,"Monroe, NC",Oak City Meatball Shoppe,"I liked it so much that I went back with a colleague  two days later. Oak City Meatball is exactly what the restaurant scene here in Raleigh has been missing. It's a great concept with simple execution and really good food. Choose a kind of meatball, choose a sauce, choose a side/salad, and your all set. I've now had the spicy pork meatballs with mango chutney, beef meatballs with parm cream sauce, and chicken meatballs with buffalo sauce. I've also tried the bruschetta, risotto, fried mac & cheese, and arugula salad. The food has all been great. I liked some better than others, but that's with everything. Overall, it's a win. The ambiance is nice. Low lit, casual, mostly mellow. It's a small place, so it can get noisy - but not overly. Like many other places here, you feel comfortable here. Beer selection wasn't too bad, but nothing to write home about. They seemed to be pushing all the summer beers - it is October, so I get that. Overall, I say go. It's worth it. I mean, c'mon. It's a place to eat meatballs, people!"
2015-10-27,2.0,"Apex, NC",Coquette Brasserie,Came here on a Tuesday night around 7:30 PM. Host was attentive and we were seated right away. Romantic ambience with plenty of small circular tables for two.  Menu was a little bit hard to see due to the dim lighting. I ordered the for cost salad which came out pretty quickly. The salad dressing was light and the greens were fresh.  The bread was fresh and the butter was light and creamy. Server was friendly and attentive. Very clean restaurant with daily specials for dinner. I would suggest dressing business casual.
2015-10-27,5.0,"Virginia Beach, VA",David’s Dumpling & Noodle Bar,Amazing. Absolutely amazing. I loved the atmosphere and the staff was delightful. My hubby and came here for the first time and got the half cooked dumplings... To die for! Highly recommended. Also tried the ramen soup and I loved it! You need to come here
2015-10-27,5.0,"Wake Forest, NC",Driftwood Southern Kitchen,"Eaten there twice.  Both times food just OK.  Not bad, but not wonderful either.  The ""AngryPotato Tots"" were simply tater tots with some dry parmesan cheese and dry bacon bits sprinkled on top.  Unimpressive.  But the real problem here was the service.  Both times, my servers seemed to be preoccupied with something else other than working that day.  Both times, only 1/3 of the tables were occupied.  I tried it once and thought I'd give it a second try.  There won't be a third."
2015-10-27,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Relish Café & Bar,"A super off the beaten path spot to take a date, friends or out of towners for dishes you couldn't find anywhere else. My go to is usually the sweet potato biscuit with chicken, pepper jelly and fried green tomatoes. Don't count on super fast service especially during brunch, in fact it's printed on the bottom of the menu. The samples of relishes, jellies, honey, and pimento cheese while you wait are to die for."
2015-10-27,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Flying Burrito,Decent food.  Low prices but need a few to make a meal. Yummy $2 tacos on Tuesday. Don't always remember this place as its a hidden treasure.
2015-10-27,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Godavari Indian Restaurant,"This place was highly recommended by a Indian friend of mine who thought this was one of the most authentic Indian food in the area. I was glad that I decided to check it out!We came here in our gym clothes after working out on a Friday night and we definitely felt a little under-dressed due to the nice decor of the restaurant. The lighting was a little dim, which makes this place perfect date nights. There was so many dishes to choose from that it took us a while to make up our mind on what we want. I enjoyed all the food that we order and thought everything was great! The dishes were all very aromatic and flavorful. Although the meat pieces in the mutton biryani were tender, they were full of bones. One thing I did not appreciate was the spicy levels. The spiciness was not consistent for all the dishes. We got spicy biryani and medium spicy for the other two dishes. However, the biryani was the least spicy one in my opinion, while the other two were overwhelming. I was very happy with the overall experience. I would love to check the buffet soon so that I can try more of the other dishes being offered by this restaurants."
2015-10-27,5.0,"Cary, NC",Trophy Brewing Company,"Beer and pizza...mmmmmmmmmmmmm...Trophy is a downtown Raleigh brewery that not only makes their own delicious beer but also hits the nail on the head with their dining options. Trophy is a seat-yourself establishment and you just go in and find the first place that is open and sit down. A server will find you and you can either browse the menu options on their chalkboards or wait for a paper menu. Most recently I had a salad and the salads come out in a silver bowl garnished with a piece of bread and the ingredients are very fresh. I had mixed greens, goat cheese, sherry vinaigrette an pecans and it was the perfect combination. My favorite pizza is still the Best Dressed because it has ground lamb and pepperoni and some vegetables. You can check out Trophy's instagram page to see the daily pizza menu as well and they change up their pizza options every day. Trophy is very kid-friendly and also dog-friendly. I have seen people bring their dogs, sit on the outside patio and even the dogs get a bowl of water and service with a smile. The atmosphere of Trophy is really relaxed and I have seen it busy every time I have been there to dine. Some breweries just do beer but Trophy does both very well."
2015-10-28,5.0,"Schertz, TX",BURGERFI,"Yes its a chain which generally doesn't offer the best food in my opinion but we really enjoyed our burgers and sides. While the menu is small that's okay, the hipster level was pretty high when we were there but that's fine too as long as a small child doesn't bother them.Overall a very decent place that I'll add into my list of places to go."
2015-10-28,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Casa Carbone Ristorante Italiano,A new go to place for me. You can eat here very inexpensively and the food was great. I had the pasta Alfredo and there was enough to feed 3 people. People were super nice as well.
2015-10-28,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Flying Saucer Draught Emporium,Great selection of beer. Service is most of the time excellent and the men really enjoy the view (waitresses). I have a frequent flyer card and come once or twice a week. The only thing i would like to see is weekly food specials or some menu variety.
2015-10-28,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Neomonde Bakery & Deli,"Fresh, healthy and authentic food! The new jalapeño cilantro hummus is a must try. You will never go wrong with kabobs. Various beans salads are great protein source for vegetarians."
2015-10-28,4.0,"Chicago, IL",Thai House,"Came to Thai House due to the good reviews and location but I have to say I'm underwhelmed. It's nice inside and the staff is friendly and quick despite being shorthanded, but the food was pretty average.  All prepared well but just bland. I started with the Tom Kha Gai and found it thin and lacking in the flavors you'd expect: kaffir lime, lemongrass, galangal, ginger, and coconut. Even punching up the lime and pepper would have helped. Moved on to the Basil Duck as it was recommended by Yelpers. Again, pretty bland. No heat, so little flavor that it was more like average Cantonese than Thai. A shame as it was prepared well but for $20, should have been much better. Maybe the cook had an off night so I'm giving benefit of the doubt and 3 stars instead of two."
2015-10-28,5.0,"Elmhurst, IL",Flying Saucer Draught Emporium,Great beer selection. The chips and Queso app is really good too. I'm wasn't crazy about the salsa they serve but the Queso is definitely worth it.
2015-10-28,5.0,"Charlotte, NC",Bolt Bistro,"Lovely dark & intimate atmosphere...the service was awesome with a nice menu variety.  The waiter was very knowledgeable and he was spot on with his menu and wine suggestions. The salads were fresh with delicious house made dressing.  The waiter suggested the lobster & shrimp pot pie...AWESOMENESS!!! Baked open-faced in a light pastry crust, with fresh veggies & a hearty well seasoned gravy. My dinner partner had the scallops and said they were tasty.  She mentioned that they had a bit too many onions for her taste, but that would've been perfect for me cuz I LOVE onions!  I would certainly recommend this hidden gem!!"
2015-10-28,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gringo A Go-Go,"While it wasn't necessarily Gringo a ""no-no"", it was certainly not a ""go-go"".  It was Gringo a ""meh-meh"". I had the burrito.  It was okay.  I had the chips and guac.  They add $5 to get an order of chips, whether you choose guacamole or salsa to go with them.  The service was pretty fast.The venue isn't too bad.  Just kinda simple. What I *do* appreciate is the blend of old country music they play.  In fact, I loved it so much that I asked where they got their mix or if someone there created the mix.  No one seemed to know.  The server asked several others who worked there, and the music remained a mystery to them. There are better Mexican joints in town.  I wouldn't choose this one over the others.  My experience wasn't bad by any stretch, but it wasn't fantastic."
2015-10-28,5.0,"Burlington, NC",Pho Far East,Excellent! I've been to a few Vietnamese restaurants in 5 different states and this has to be the best 1 I've ever been to! Sad thing is I live 52 miles from here but I will be back! :-) I'm definitely going to bring my friends & family back!!
2015-10-28,3.0,"Waterford, CT",Shaba Shabu,"Ordered take out.  Miso soup, good, seaweed salad, good, bogo rolls, spicy tuna and eel, poor.  Bogo gets you two rolls that are both made with half of the main ingredient, mostly rice and they are small.  No deal here.  Could not taste any eel as it was almost non existent.  Spicy tuna was with just chilli powder.  No creativity here.  I was disappointed.  Not likely to return."
2015-10-28,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Vinos Finos Tapas and Wine Bar,I've been coming here since they opened. Wine section is fantastic and the food is always amazing. Staff is all very friendly and knowledgeable about the wine and food selections. Get the cheese stuffed peppers!
2015-10-28,5.0,"Antwerp, Belgium",Pho Far East,Awesome Pho ! loved the broth.
2015-10-28,5.0,"Apex, NC",Fu Kee Express,"Came here on my lunch break today. I have driven past Fu Kee in the past but never stopped to dine. A Yelp search led me here. En route to Fu Kee, I attempted to call several times to place a pick up order.  My calls went unanswered. Upon further inspection of the reviews I saw that it was a one-man show. I knew then I would just have to wait until I arrived to place my order. This was a bit of a downer as my round-trip commute to the restaurant would cut my lunch break in half but I decided to suck it up and sojourn on. Upon arrival, I noticed the place was mostly empty with the exception of another client placing his order. Kind of disappointing being that my calls went unanswered but I did see that the gentleman was alone. So kept a positive outlook. The client in front of me tried to give the owner business advice about hiring another worker of which he was not accepting. ""Too expensive!"" he barked repeatedly before gruffly taking my order:  broccoli and brown sauce with white rice. My total was $7.55 for the lunch special which didn't include anything other than what I ordered :0(. A bit steep when compared to the other lunch specials in the area. After 10 minutes, the order was complete and I headed back to the office. Upon arrival, I found the generously portioned lunch box. I thought, ""Well maybe it was worth it!"" I took the first bite and  was let down by the flavor. The sauce lacked seasoning as did the broccoli despite its crunchy, freshness. Overall, thought it was an upset.  I certainly wouldn't venture to the area solely for Fu Kee in the future. Ah well..."
2015-10-28,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",DeMo’s Pizzeria & Deli,"Let me first say this is a 4 star only because I went once. I consider it 5 worthy, I just need to test it out some more.  I'm craving this pizza again and I am happy I randomly came across it. one hungry, chilly, Saturday evening.  It's simplicity is great. The pizza was great NY Style with a lot of options, for a great price by the slice or by the pie. I also got myself some hot wings -which were great and  had their own flare/taste to them rather than run of the mill or soggy stuff.  The venue itself was nice enough especially on that particular evening and it wasn't crowded or insane. The staff was genuinely friendly and looked to be enjoying themselves which goes a long way into making good food I think. The best part about this all are the hours -  to have an accessible great place with hours that cater to late night cravings or the poor stumbling masses is absolutely phenomenal in a city that is creating it's own unique and fun culture (which is something this place adds to).  This is definitely a place I'll consider as my go to / fall back pizza place, all just down the street from the homestead."
2015-10-28,5.0,"Dallas, TX",Tupelo Honey Cafe Raleigh,Visiting Raleigh and met up with friends here.  Not a big fan of southern food but this place had a fresh twist... Homemade from scratch ! But I do love biscuits and they bring that out before your meal with their house made jam and butter... It was awesome.  The pimento dip was very good... I didn't like the duck... It was not flavorful and it was too rare (even though I asked for it to be medium well)... Just tasted like I was eating literally Raw duck.. So I only ate 2 of 5 pieces) But my friend's  shrimp and grits was really good.  They had drinks and enjoyed them as well. I would go back to try something new but especially for the simple homemade biscuits!
2015-10-28,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Guasaca,"After reading so many reviews, I'll admit I was expecting to get totally blown away. We ordered a variety of arrepas, the chicken, pork and steak. For about $3-$4 each not very expensive for our family, typically runs us about $50 for eating out, it was $35 for 4 of us including three drinks (no tip since there is no waiter service). The arrepas were messy but had a ok flavor. The guasaca itself lacked flavor, had the usual tomato and onion like guacamole but perhaps was just in need of some salt? Not worth the extra surcharge.  I think what we were expecting was flavor, from the black beans to to actual meats. Nothing was bad per say, yet nothing made me go, ""wow that was good!"" Nothing out of the ordinary. Had high expections for this place, will not be coming again."
2015-10-28,5.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Soo Café,"5/5. So happy I got to try out this place because it's soooo hard to find good Korean Fried Chicken in NC. Between two people, we shared one order of 10 wings (soy garlic sauce) and one order of the 6 tenders (original sauce). It was enough to fill both of us up! I enjoyed literally every single bite. The chicken is full of flavor and very juicy. I am getting hungry just thinking about it now.Tip: If you ask for a small side of radish, you can get it with no charge (per table)! Our waiter was nice and made sure that we had everything we needed. He was attentive and gave us good recommendations. I can't wait to go back and try their other flavors!"
2015-10-28,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Waraji Japanese Restaurant,Food is ok but prices are extreme for the quality. I much rather prefer Tazu. Seating is very tight.
2015-10-28,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Second Empire Restaurant And Tavern,"In my opinion, this is the best restaurant in the Triangle. The only tip I would give people is that the default dining areas are very formal and too quiet. We like the Tavern much better. My favorite dish is the Pork Belly Risotto. I had only tried pork bellies one other time (at a different restaurant) and they were okay. The way they were prepared at Second Empire was incredible. I definitely recommend this restaurant for any special event."
2015-10-28,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Yard House,Love the yard house. I'm from WI and their cheese curds are spot on. Food is always fresh and staff is friendly. One of my favorite local spots.
2015-10-28,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Trophy Brewing Company,"Great pizza, great atmosphere, great beer! Love the Farmers Market pizza with cheese. Tons of fresh veggies. The arugula salad is great too! Honestly, never had a bad meal or time here."
2015-10-28,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Raleigh Times Bar,Food was a 5 but service was a 1. As a former bartender and server I am very cautious when I write reviews about the service. I look at how many people are on staff and how busy the restaurant is. There was no excuse for this. I was here Sunday night and sat on the roof top. Table was not cleaned. The bartender served us and another server was checking on us. Both women were not friendly. Wine glass had lipstick on it...Something bartenders should ALWAYS check for.
2015-10-29,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mura,This is my fiancés favorite sushi place. Great wine list. Nice outdoor patio. I don't eat seafood and they do have great no seafood options. Love the BLT roll.
2015-10-29,5.0,"Salem, MA",Tarbouch,"Ordered some dinner and had it delivered to my hotel room, but I'm sorry to say that the food wasn't very good.  The food arrived quickly, about 40 minutes after i ordered.   The Chicken Sheesh Taouk Platter was very bland and the chicken did not taste fresh.   I got it with a side salad (which was very good) and basmati rice, which was also bland.  Since they have a $30 minimum for delivery, i also ordered the falafels with hummus, soup of the day and baklava.  The hummus was very watery and the falafels were swimming in it. Plus the garlic taste was very overwhelming.  Did not care for that dish at all.  Have no idea what kind of soup it was, but it smelled and tasted awful.  I ended up throwing it away (along with most of the food). Baklava was just okay, did not taste fresh either. The highlight of the meal was the pita bread, which was very soft and tasted wonderful with the side salad! All in all, i was disappointed with the food and would not order from this restaurant again."
2015-10-29,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Monapita Mediterranean Grill,"Fresh, authentic Mediterranean food!  This restaurant is tucked away in a corner of a little strip mall, but is easily accessible.  Has a few tables for outdoor seating.  Inside is clean and bright.  You order and pick up at the counter.  Prices are reasonable.  I ordered the veggie plate with babaghanouj, salad, hummus, falafel, and pita points (not what was on the picture on their website which had grape leaves and tabouleh),but it was good nonetheless.  Plenty of items to choice from.  Great spot."
2015-10-29,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bonefish Grill,Another favorite date night spot. I'm not a fan of chain restaurants and Bone Fish is one of my only exceptions. We always eat at the bar and every bartender had been very accommodating and incredibly knowledgable about the food and drink menu. Burger is fantastic. I also had the pumpkin creme brûlée on the seasonal menu. Amazing!
2015-10-29,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",DeMo’s Pizzeria & Deli,"Always great service & food.  Staff is very friendly & nice & we've never been disappointed.  Have used them for delivery too & its awesome to call from sunning at the pool looking at their menu on line.

2015-10-29,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",DeMo’s Pizzeria & Deli,"Finally, a very good pizza joint in my own neighborhood after 25 years of waiting.  I have been going to Franklin Street Pizza in Chapel Hill.  I was raised in the Bronx and Manhattan and I am very particular about my pizza.  Looking forward to trying other items on the menu!  Easy online ordering & payment for take out or delivery.    Please give DeMo's your patronage.  I don't want to go back to Chapel Hill for anymore pizza!"

They offer a decent variety on their menu. Mostly sandwiches and pizza. They have late hours. We ordered sandwiches, I'd like to try their pizza next time. Casual and comfortable atmosphere. I look forward to returning."
2015-10-29,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gravy,"Love this little restaurant. My fiancé and I were here for brunch a few weeks back. The bartender and server were both taking care of us.

2015-10-29,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Seoul Garden Restaurant,"Food is very tasty. Great drink menu. It's a nice place for any occasion. Staff has always been very friendly.Updated review. Ordered a bottle of wine rather than by the glass and they charge a $32 surcharged for splitting a bottle. Never have I seen that before and even though it was only $2 it still was a turn off when receiving the bill.I ate at the BBQ table and ordered the ribs and beef. The chef brings scissors for cutting the ribs. My fiancé and I wanted to cook the meat ourselves. The food runner left the scissors on raw meat and we were never brought a clean plate or scissors.

2015-10-29,5.0,"Durham, NC",The Fiction Kitchen,5 stars all around. A friend of mine told me to give it a try and when I went in I was a little apprehensive. To be honest I had never heard of most of the ingredients but I just picked something and it was delicious! Every part of my experience was excellent!
2015-10-30,4.5,"Raleigh, NC",Night Kitchen Bakehouse & Cafe,"It's easy to miss Night Kitchen, hidden in a corner of Seaboard station across from Logan's, but it's worth navigating the parking lot for their delicious baked goods and friendly service!The pain au chocolat is a treat; flaky-crisp and never too sweet, with the dark chocolate providing a counterpoint to the buttery richness of the dough. The bagels are also a delight, managing to be at once fluffy and pleasantly chewy without being dense, just the way a bagel should be. The coffee is also good and the staff are pleasant and helpful - exactly what you want for a morning perk-up or evening pick-me-up!"
2015-10-30,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Cameron Bar and Grill,"We went to Cameron Bar and Grill for the Great Pumpkin Dinner. It was a $45 all inclusive 5 course pumpkin bourbon inspired dinner paired with 5 bourbon drinks. It was an incredible deal considering the drinks alone would run you close to $45. All of the bourbon drinks were full size cocktails and were really strong. The bourbon smash with Bulleit bourbon and the pumpkin old fashion were my favorite drinks. I also thought the Big Boss Pumpkin was pretty tasty. It's half Harvest Time and half Bad Penny. The Pumpkin pie martini was the most unique drink. It was thick and really strong, with a sweet after taste from the candied sugar rim of the glass. Overall, I was impressed with the drinks and how much there was. The food was what I signed up for and it did not disappoint. I really enjoyed the pan seared scallop over pumpkin purée. The scallop was huge and succulent, and the pumpkin purée was excellent, not too over powering. Following that was an amazing pumpkin ginger bourbon bisque served in a mini pumpkin. It was thick yet smooth and was wonderful to eat. I'm so glad the chef handed out the recipe for the soup because it is something I will definitely try to replicate. The roasted pumpkin frisée salad was refreshing and following that was the highlight of the meal: pumpkin crusted pork loin stuffed with house cured pork belly. The pork tender and juicy and had a good natural saltiness from the amazing pork belly. The pork belly was chopped up and sprinkled everywhere like bacon bits, and it was simply delicious. The meal was finished off with a nice pumpkin tart with house made pumpkin ice cream and a bourbon chocolate sauce. I really enjoyed the themed dinner and would highly recommend trying Cameron Bar and Grill for their annual themed dinners. For $45, tax and tip included, you get good food paired with plenty of drinks. It was an awesome dinner, and I would sign up for another one for sure!"
2015-10-30,4.0,"Apex, NC",Saltwater Seafood & Fry Shack,"A hidden gem indeed. Came here for the first time here on my lunch break, per a review from the Raleigh yelpers with a hankering for some fresh shrimp and fries and my fellow Yelpers did not disappoint. Warning to the snooty: This is a lunch counter inside of a fresh fish market...You will smell fresh fish. If you don't like the smell of fresh fish, this is not your place. For the rest of us who will go to any height or depth for great food, proceed. When you walk in you immediately notice a clean shiny interior and yummy, fresh fish EVERYWHERE. I was promptly assisted at the counter by a nice gentleman with whom I placed my order: regular-sized popcorn shrimp with double fries. After about 5 minutes, my number was called and I was on my way. I opened the box to behold freshly cooked shrimp, fries and hush puppies. The shrimp were perfectly cooked, moist and just slightly dusted with a crispy corn meal dredge. Both the shrimp and fries were sprinkled with the perfect amount of seasoned salt. I took my first bite and had to look around to make sure I wasn't down in Wilmington!!  The seafood was so fresh with just a hint of that characteristic fresh-from-the-sea sweetness. The fries were perfectly crispy outside and piping hot and potato-filled inside. The portion was beyond generous. So much that by the time I got to the hush puppies, I couldn't eat another morsel!Best of all, my whole meal was under $8! This place is amazing to say the least and it the true epitome of NC Seafood!  I will be a regular here!!"
2015-10-30,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Margaux’s Restaurant,"We have been going to Margeaux's on and off for 20 years and I have seen consistent improvement in every part of the operation. I used to not be a fan, but lately we've been going probably every 3rd Friday night. The servers are super friendly and professional and the salmon and scallops are phenomenal. I can't give 5 stars for a few reasons: service was pretty slow tonight, we never got the bread basket (which is delicious), and when I've tried their unusual meats (antelope, deer) which the staff says are amazing, they have not been good and I felt like I did not get a good meal for the price I paid."
2015-10-30,5.0,"Morrisville, NC",Cameron Bar and Grill,Amazing food! Their brunch is delicious and the service is impeccable. The salmon burger is my favorite. I often go their with girlfriends to grab a glass of wine. The atmosphere is great and the menu is perfect.

2015-10-30,4.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Garland,"I was told that Garland was Asian fusion cuisine, so that's what I was expecting my first time dining here. I disagree with calling it Asian fusion style, and would lean much more to referring to it as having Indian style dishes. So, if you don't like Indian food, I wouldn't recommend Garland. Also, if you are a picky eater, don't bother dining here. We had one picky eater in our group, and I could tell she had no idea what to order. The menu is very small and there is a limited number of entrées listed. However, if you do like Indian food, definitely check this place out! The atmosphere is super laid back. It is a smaller restaurant downtown, so get here on the earlier side as seats will fill up. The staff was friendly and helpful with the menu. I think it would be good to go back with a group of friends and try a variety of the small plates which all sounded good. I tried the tandoor chicken. It was excellent! Such a fun dish with so many options of how to eat it. The naan bread was delicious. The chicken was crispy, super flavorful, and not too spicy. The peppers and onions were a great touch to add to the chicken. The yogurt sauce was delicious as well. I wished there was more of the cauliflower and carrots given with the dish, as I felt I only got one bite and it was all gone. I was not a fan of the mint sauce. The prices are a bit on the high side, but the food is high quality and very flavorful. Everyone else at the table loved their dishes too. I have to come back here to try the small plates and some of the fancy cocktails! This is a chill, but higher end, restaurant downtown. If you're looking for somewhere new and cool to try, I'd recommend it!"

2015-10-30,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Soo Café,"Best Korean chicken in the triangle. Period. Just go, eat, and thank all the reviewers later.SOGA sauce is good, but I'm partial to the Original as the soy isn't as strong and it's a touch sweeter. Don't forget a side of rice!"
2015-10-30,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tijuana Flats,Loves this place. Staff was super cool and welcoming for our first trip. Great food and atmosphere. I will definitely be back.
2015-10-30,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Soo Café,"I've had Korean fried chicken multiple times in both the NYC and Boston area, but this has got to be one of my favorites!The chicken wings are fried with the perfect batter of crispy, saucey, and crackly goodness while the meat inside is so juicy and tender. I've had the SoGa and Old Fashioned sauces and LOVED both of them. The SoGa sauce tastes like a sweet soy, garlic, honey, and ginger mix while the Old Fashioned sauce has a slightly sweet but bold gochujang (Korean red pepper/soybean paste) flavor. You'll find that the wings are pretty big and the sauces are VERY sticky, but all the more delicious!!"
2015-10-30,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Ajisai Japanese Fusion,"Brief: Excellent food. Poor service. Hope it is a one time thing, will try again because the food was that good.Details: Made reservations for 2 at 8:00 PM on a Friday. Arrived promptly at 8 and was surprised at how small the restaurant was. Felt more like a quick sushi bar for lunch type atmosphere than Friday night date night. If you're looking for that kind of ambiance you're better off with Sono or Mura. Back to the service - I could see an empty 4 top (which we were eventually seated at) but was told by the hostess if would be a 15-20 minute wait unless we wanted to sit out side. My wife preferred indoors, so we opted against. Irritated with the open table despite our reservations I asked the hostess what the point of making reservations was if there weren't tables ready for such occasions. She stared at me blankly until the manager stepped over and intervened. She asked us to wait outside at a table while she got a table ready for us inside.I should have prefaced with the fact that it was obvious as soon as we walked in that the service staff was overwhelmed and sinking quickly.Our waiter was actually quite good, but again we could tell he was anxious and visibly had a hurried look about him all evening. We ordered ordered 2 starters, an entree and two sushi rolls. During the wait for starters the hostess tried to bring us another tables check then took it to two other tables before finding the right one. We watched a family get served in at least five minute intervals. And overhead a party of at least 8 complaining about 3 sushi rolls they had yet to receive an hour after everyone else's food had been served at the table. We were fortunate enough to avoid these blunders. Closest we came was having the started brought out separately, my rolls were a few minutes ahead of my wife's entree and we almost didn't get her salad/my soup (came out after we mentioned it to server as he brought our mains). Not perfect, but tolerable.The food was really quite good, the sushi was on par with several of the other Raleigh staples. Would have been a 5 star review if the ambiance were a little better (even just dimming the bright lights a little) and there wasn't such an overwhelmingly nervous/anxois/irritated atmosphere. Firm believer in second chances, so I will try them again and hope this was just an off night for the team."
2015-10-30,4.0,"Cary, NC",Big Ed’s City Market Restaurant,"Best customer service I've had in a while. Had my biscuits and gravy out in under 5 minutes. It tasted delicious and fresh. With just a glance I was able to communicate that I needed the check. Extraordinarily friendly and bright, which is something I don't see often.So glad I stumbled upon this place in city market."
2015-10-30,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Relish Café & Bar,"A cozy and lovely spot for a southern brunch, but I felt a little underwhelmed with my meal. I ordered the 'Mater biscuit, which was a sweet potato biscuit topped with a fried green tomato, bacon slices, and creamy gravy sauce. The dish came out close to room temperature and although the biscuit tasted good, it was very hard! I did enjoy my side of cheesy grits, but the meal just felt very heavy with all the gravy on the dish."
2015-10-30,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Godavari Indian Restaurant,"Godavari opened where Swad used to be. The staff is the same. The decor is the same. The menu, though it retained some of the original items, clearly changed recipes.We were super sad to see Swad gone, but figured that since everything was nearly the same, the food that we loved would still be there. We were mistaken.We ordered 4 Chicken Tikka Masala of varied spice levels, 2 plain naan, and 2 garlic naan. The Tikka Masala portions have changed from what they once were. One dish came with only 2 ounces of chicken (2 ounces of chicken for 13.99... seriously??) and 4 ounces of chopped onions and peppers. The other three dishes came with 3.5 ounces of chicken. Yes, we weighed each because the portions look NOTHING like they used to serve as Swad. The naan was very gummy, like it had been kneaded too long and developed too much gluten. It was not cooked evenly and burnt on the edges.We felt very let down by this experience as we used to order from this restaurant at least once a month. It was a great Indian restaurant. I doubt we will be back."
2015-10-30,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",MOD Pizza,"Very cool concept. Nice speed of service. This is a new restaurant that serves pizza. My most recent visit was unsatisfactory. You guys had run out of chicken and bacon for an order I placed. You also ran out of boxes!? Come on guys. Never have I ever heard of a pizza place running out of those two items. Especially after two months of being open. When I asked what happened, the older lady who gave me my food said that the store manager wants to bonus off of cost of goods. I come here often and know some employees by face. You can't keep this up guys."
2015-10-30,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kamado Grille,"Neither bar nor restaurant.... Not comfy or sleek... It's just odd. Not an unpleasant experience but not one I'd seek out again. Food is passable if a bit middle of the road...Oh... And I've worked as a server, but I don't know why I'd tip any more than as if I was at a buffet."
2015-10-30,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Station,"A beautiful fall day to sit outside at The Station. Great outdoor seating and friendly service. The food....looks delicious and great presentation....but....it was just ok. It was average. The mac & cheese needed salt and the sloppy joe tasted ok, very tomatoey. It had wilted potato chips underneath the meat which kinda freaked me out because I thought I was eating paper. The spinach artichoke appetizer was soupy and not hot. Ate it but won't order it again. Overall, eh, again average.  Expensive for average."
2015-10-31,4.0,"Rockingham, NC",Abyssinia Ethiopian Restaurant,"Food is good, prices are really high!I mean I would love to go there more but, every time we go we end up adding more because the portions are too small and very expensive. Other than that, it's a nice place!"
2015-10-31,5.0,"Apex, NC",Alpaca Peruvian Charcoal Chicken,"Best Peruvian chicken in the Raleigh, Durham and Cary areas. Always well-seasoned, juicy and piping hot. The whole chicken, which comes with 2 large sides is the best deal and great for sharing.  The leftovers are yummy reheated or re-purposed. I typically use it to make chicken salad the next day. Their homemade sides and homemade sauces are the perfect complements to the chicken. They are all delicious but I always opt for the tostones and yucca frita (and yes...they are worth the extra $.50)! If you're in the mood for something other than their awesome chicken they make a mean lomo saltado and their daily specials never disappoint.  If you're not opting for water to drink, try the homemade chi cha morada. The spicy clove and cinnamon make this drink absolutely yummy. If you want a beer with your meal, grab the Presidente. The only criticism I have of Mami Nora's/Alpaca is that the tres leches and alfajores are prepackaged. As a lover of tres leches I wish this wasn't so. But honestly with food like this who needs dessert? We have been regular patrons for over 5 years (starting at the Wake Forest Road location and now here) and we will continue to be for years to come. Welcome to your newest addiction!!"

2015-10-31,4.0,"Newport, NC",Oak City Meatball Shoppe,"I feel that meatballs are an underappreciated food. They are often seen more as an accompaniment to a meal than the main dish itself. The Oak City Meatball Shoppe flips that notion on its head. First of all, the drinks at this place make it a great bar and hangout spot even if you're not in the dinner mood. I especially love the entire section of the drink menu dedicated to bourbon whiskies. We next ordered three sets of meatballs and sides to split between us: the traditional beef with mushroom gravy, the chicken with pesto and the spicy pork with parmesan cream sauce. All were amazing and flavorful with the right amount of spices, herbs and salt. We also got sides of Mac and cheese, risotto and polenta. Delicious! All of the sides were creamy concoctions of flavorful epicness. Closing the meal was a slice of pumpkin pie that would rival any made by grandma (sorry grandma). The service was great and the atmosphere is fitting to the hip urbaness that is downtown Raleigh. Definitely will be back!"
2015-10-31,5.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Oak City Meatball Shoppe,This place is a ripoff of the Meatball Shop in NYC. Food is good but two stars for zero originality. Their menu is literally the exact same. Place should be shut down!
2015-10-31,5.0,"Holly Springs, NC",Second Empire Restaurant And Tavern,"I was searching for a unique experience for my husband's birthday. He is a trained chef and loves to cook. When I found the Chef's table at Second Empire, I knew he would love it. My husband acted like a kid in a candy store. The four course dinner was amazing. Executive Chef Daniel was cool!...and so were the Sous Chefs. The rest of the staff was kind and courteous the entire 3 hours. It was well worth the money and a memorable experience.  The crab cakes were moist and melted in our mouths. The swordfish and lamb rack left us hungry for more. And the mousse soufflé just left us stuffed. Each wine paired perfectly with each course. Thank you again. Awesome!"
2015-10-31,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",First Watch,"Food was ok but nothing special. They didn't have biscuits on a Saturday morning,  they use corn syrup ""maple syrup""  and the takeout process was a mess.  They forgot our drinks and we had to ask twice for plastic wear. Also in my opinion the food was overpriced for the quality."
2015-10-31,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sardi’s Den,"Food: 3.5Service: 4Ambience: 2.5Date/Time: 10/31/2015 8pmThis restaurant is a typical sports bar set up with TVs on all walls and nothing to absorb sound so it's very noisy. The Jack Daniela Beef Brisket hoagie was tasty but a bit more fat in the meat than some places. The red BBQ sauce tasted best of the 4 offered. The pulled chicken plate was good with a flavor cooked into the chicken that went good with the red sauce. Service was quick and friendly with a knowledgable server (Tiffany) who offered up taste samples of the sauces. Overall I'd rate it 3 to 3.5 due to the noise and fatty beef. I'd recommend it for the chicken, and maybe the beef if you can see what you're eating to avoid the fat."
2015-10-31,5.0,"San Jose, CA",Second Empire Restaurant And Tavern,My husband and I ate there last night for our 7th wedding anniversary. We called ahead to get an earlier reservation and the hostess said there is no way we could get an earlier table. We got there 45 minutes early anyways and planned to walk around outside if we really couldn't get a table and of course there were at least 5 tables open. They seated us immediately and the hostess said happy anniversary. The waitress came by 10 minutes later and asked if we had any menu questions and also wished us a happy anniversary. Then my husband explained his severe dietary restrictions and she said she would go see what the chef could do. 20 minutes later she came back. I also asked her which wine would go best with the steak and she started just listing every wine they had. She clearly had no clue what to suggest. We ordered and 30 minutes went by with no waitress and no food. Once the food arrived the dandelions my husband requested were not in his food. He asked her and she said well I'm sure they are in there somewhere. She never came back to see if the dandelions were in there and only came back 30 minutes later with the desert menu and the check. The oddest thing then happened. She came out with ice cream and told me happy birthday. It's not my birthday. No one told her it's my birthday and she had already said happy anniversary at the beginning of our meal. The food was pretty good but the service was beyond unusual and we only saw our waitress 4 times over a 2 hour meal. We were expecting amazing service and ended up with a mediocre odd experience

2015-10-31,4.0,"Cary, NC",Bella Monica,The food is delicious. The shrimp scampi was good. The lasagna is an absolute must. I went for my birthday and I was not disappointed!!! They also wrote a birthday message on the sidewalk for me.
2015-10-31,5.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Buku,"Ramen was meh. I used to eat ramen all the time in NYC and the broth was always the best part. I hadn't had ramen since I moved back to NC, so I was excited to see it on their menu. Their broth was pretty bland. Steamed buns were good, but kinda tasted like a McRib. Buku roll was really good, definitely the best part of our meal. Got the warm apple tart for dessert which was really big and tasty. I'm a coffee snob and I wasn't impressed by the Larry's Beans single origin Honduran coffee. Cool atmosphere though but the food could be a lil better in my opinion. Our waiter George was great as well. I'd definitely try out Buku but idk if I'll go back."
2015-10-31,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Flying Biscuit Café,"The food was average but the service was HORRIBLE!!! I went this morning and I sat in the sunroom for over 10 mins before anyone ever spoke to me. The only reason they did was she was surprised to see me in there. Apparently this area should have been manned by the bartender.  How in the world can you not see a large black woman in a sun room is beyond me. However, when it was time for a tip she saw me then to bring my change in single. I will say the one good thing this restaurant had on its side was this young long brown hair hostess would had enough humanity to realize that her establishment mistreated a patron. The hostess finally brought me water and took my order. This is the person you should have training individuals not that bartender.  She taught others to mistreat and not acknowledge patrons. Service matters when your food is average!"
2015-11-01,4.0,"Landis, NC",The Roast Grill,"Mark me down in the blasphemous minority. Not a Roast Grill fan. Positives:The Roast Grill hot dogs are a Raleigh institution, and their tiny restaurant is a throwback in time which I truly enjoyed the atmosphere of. Also, Lunchtime there while the legislature is in session is really a spot to be for a fan of the NC political world. Never know who may walk in next with whom.But the HUGE Negative is... For those of us who do not like their meat incinerated beyond recognition, this is not a place to be. Wieners almost inedible. Their overwhelming carbonized, charred flavor completely covers the weak, watery chili which could have possibly covered the burnt taste. Sorry, but a deal killer for me. Bottom line: if you like your steak cooked ""well done"" or better,  you'll love Roast Grill.  But if you like to enjoy the flavor of meat without the ashes, I would advise lunch somewhere else."
2015-11-01,1.0,"Cary, NC",Pam’s Farm House,"It was just ok, I read the reviews and was anxious to try the food.  While it was good it wasn't great and I prob won't go back.  Not worth waiting in line for.  Decor old and dated, staff very friendly.  We had a great time while there so I can check it off, next!!!"
2015-11-01,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tijuana Flats,"I have been to Tijuana Flats twice and have had a very satisfying meal both times. I really like the sauce bar they have. With a plethora of sauces ranging from mild and sweet to scorching hot, you really get to mix up the flavors you want in your meal. The sauces and the nicely seasoned tortilla chips really set Tijuana Flats apart from other similar Tex Mex restaurants. The variety of entrees on the menu also sets Tijuana apart. I had the carnitas norrito bowl, which is basically a burrito bowl with no tortilla. The carnitas were pull apart tender and juicy. All of the veggies were fresh and I love fresh jalapeños they use. Guacamole and sour cream are also included with the burrito bowl! I also have tried the beef burrito and it was also very filling and satisfying. I also go my burrito ""wet"" by adding chipotle red sauce, melted cheese, and scallions. It basically turned the burrito into a giant enchilada, which I didn't mind because it was good. Overall, Tijuana is good Tex mex. Their meat is definitely better quality than other competitors except Chipotle. I love the variety of sauces and entrees that's sure to guarantee you a unique dining experience since not limited to just ordering a burrito or taco. I also must stress that the cookie dough flautas are incredible! They are amazingly delicious because the chocolate chip cookie dough is hot and melty inside a fried tortilla. The dust of powder sugar and chocolate sauce completes the dessert, and I guarantee it will be the best $3 you spend here."
2015-11-01,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Jimmy V’s Osteria & Bar,"This is a tricky review to write, because I haven't been a fan of Jimmy V's, but this pizza was great! Not long after they opened they jacked their prices quite a bit which doesn't make for the best of customer relations, and the quality of the food has been inconsistent. But I have to give them props for the Tuscan Wood-Fired Pizza. Grilled chicken, artichokes, prosciutto, olives, tomatoes, mozzarella, basil, and arugula. It was a little on the salty side for me, but I'm sure that was coming from the prosciutto (which is typically not in my diet). This is a 12"" pie, I'm a petite person, and I nearly ate the entire thing. I can't say I'm going to rush in for an entree, but I'll definitely order pizza again!"

2015-11-01,4.0,"Philadelphia, PA",Pho Vietnam,"Pho broth is pretty spot on, meaty and flavorful. The meats themselves are high quality, tender, and delicious. You get all of the normal accompaniments (lime, thai basil, bean sprouts, etc.).  Hoisin, sriracha, and chili garlic sauce are available at the table.I will start off by saying I am spoiled and have access to a variety of great Pho joints in Philadelphia. We were passing through on a road trip back from Savannah and really wanted pho and decided to hit up Pho Vietnam. The building was very clean and the wait staff was quite friendly. My only gripe is the pricing! The cost of living down South is typically cheaper than up North, but I can get a small bowl of pho here in Philly for !$6, and the small bowl is larger than the large that is offered at Pho Vietnam. A large bowl will run you about $9.50. I will say that it is a perfectly portioned bowl and we were very satisfied with it. I also noticed that the vietnamese iced coffee comes out pre-made. I prefer to have the dripper brought out with a glass of ice so I can determine how much condensed milk I want to stir in. I don't like it to be TOO sweet. Not a deal breaker though, I just didn't order one.Overall. Great pho. A little expensive but is definitely worth a try."

Best thing they have is the Philly cheese steak egg rolls. Yummy! They come with a cheese dipping sauce. Be careful though because they always come out piping hot so don't burn your mouth like I did. I also like the fish and chips. The fish is crispy and fresh tasting. The service is always great and it is a great place to meet friends for dinner.

Kind of a strange ambiance- looks like a chain, but it's not.I never am in this part of Raleigh, but I may have to make a trip back here.And you know what?  The leftovers were even better than they were when we ordered them fresh.  For real!  (Or maybe I was just really hungry at lunchtime the next day.)"
2015-11-01,5.0,"Cary, NC",First Watch,"Although I had not heard of this restaurant prior to seeing its high reviews here on Yelp I really enjoyed this restaurant. My husband & I had breakfast on a Sunday a.m., about 8am, and were pleased to see this is a full-service restaurant & we were seated at once. The atmosphere & decor are pleasant -- a mix between new industrial & farm house. I liked that the menu had lots of healthy choices & the company obviously leans that way in their philosophies. My husband liked that their portions were large enough to fill him up & if he wanted something high calorie he had that option. After we finally made up our minds as to which of the scrumptious offerings to choose, our food was delivered promptly. My husband had the granola pancakes & they really were HUGE as they warn in their menu. I had the egg-white omelette & they happily accommodated my requested to add avocado & I have to say it was an egg-cellent egg-white omelette -- which is nothing short of amazing because egg whites are not good by themselves!! The prices were reasonable, similar to what you pay at any other decent sit-down restaurant. I do recommend going early because as another reviewer stated, the place does fill up quickly. We will certainly go back -- to try all the other delicious sounding items on their menu!"
2015-11-01,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Papa’s Pizza & Subs,When you have food allergies it can be very difficult to find a place to eat that is safe for you and your family. I got very lucky when I found Papa's Pizza & Subs.I can't have gluten which means bread is out and I was craving a Philly Cheesesteak. I came to Papa's and they not only made me a delicious cheesesteak that was safe for me to eat but also pointed out several other items that would be safe for me to eat as well. They are very conscious of all of the ingredients that go into their food and work diligently to assure that their customers get exactly what they want/need in their food! I even talked to a family with severe lactose intolerance who were able to get modified pizzas here that didn't make them sick!The staff is friendly and attentive and this is by far one of the best places to eat in North Raleigh. Totally worth the trip!
2015-11-01,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Death & Taxes,Great service and atmosphere! Menu was small and limited with mostly odd types of food. If you like something a bit different try this place. I was Googling a few of the items on the menu because we weren't quit sure what they were. If you're a picky eater then you probably won't find anything on the menu that you like.
2015-11-01,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Big Al’s BBQ,I have only been to Big Al's one time but it was very good. I really should frequent it more often. The prices were good and bbq was exceptional. I liked the wide variety of sauces they had. It was fun to try a couple different ones and compare them. Their flavors were quite different depending on what type you use. I'd certainly go back again.
2015-11-01,5.0,"Holly Springs, NC",Seoul Garden Restaurant,"For my birthday this year I ate at Golden Pig, Seoul Garden and Smart.  Three days of feasting on Korean food.HEAVEN!  I had to update my review here as I have been sampling Korean all over RTP for many years (I still have a list to try out) and I can't really find a place that holds a candle to Seoul Garden.  Service is always top notch. It's a great place to dine with just two or ten.  The food is fabulous!The only dish I did not like was the chapchae and that was 5 years ago.  I've not ordered it since but other than that time It's been absolutely amazing for 10 years.  The soups are fabulous, the pancakes are huge and yummy, the ojinga bokkum is plentiful, the rice is always perfectly cooked.  I've had the pork belly, the tofu and kimchi, the tangsuyuk, bossum, kkangpoong. . .all so tasty and beautifully presented.  Saturday for lunch I had the Al Tang.  Fish Egg soup is not for the faint of heart.  But it is truly my favorite soup. I'm a great cook (pats herself on the back) but I can not make this soup right.  And boy does SEOUL GARDEN do it right.  Full of roe, yummy fresh watercress, beansprouts, cabbage, HUGE chunks of high quality tofu, a nice shrimp with head on and a broth that is good to the last drop. I devoured the whole huge Korean sized bowl.  It's served to you boiling hot and it stays warm until the very last spoonful.  Every side dish was perfection.  Texture, seasoning, flavor and SEVEN varieties.  I had an Asahi beer and the barley tea with my meal.  If you have a friend that wants to try Korean for the first time you should bring him/her here first.  it's by far the best I've had in the Triangle."

I finally got the courage to try the portabella mushroom taco. Every time I go I look at the price and think I should just get a meat taco, but I had a dire mushroom craving and went for it. It was perfect. The flavor was great and it had a smorgasbord of mushroom (well as much as you can have on one little taco). I will definitely get that taco again. I really like the flavors of Chubby's tacos. My concern is that the tacos are small and expensive. This means that unless I want a light meal (which is rarely the case), I need to order an abundance of tacos and then I start thinking that at that price, I can just go to some other place and that is usually what happens. When I finally make it to Chubby's, I always think that I should come here more often. I really like the authentic Mexican two-layer corn soft taco shells they use. The salsa bar is also pretty great; nice selection, good taste, and it has sliced jalapeños. When you order a taco it comes with a few complementary tortilla chips but not a lot. I guess I can't complain since it is free."
2015-11-01,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Big Ed’s North,"Food is decent, service is spotty, orange juice is god-awful. Went here for brunch. There was a line outside and a delightful greeter for the line. They moved us in fast. Decor is down-home, pleasant and inviting. We got to our table and were promptly greeted by our server who took our drink order, which included two cups of orange juice. She forgot one of the OJ's when she brought our order, but that was good as the orange juice was downright bad. I am assuming they use concentrate. This is a shame considering the rest of the meal and was a real low point. (If you serve brunch have good OJ)When our food came...it was great. Not just good. It is an excellent meal, and I felt a good value. The corn beef hash, biscuits, eggs and everything else on our plates were amazing! Bravo! The pancakes...whew...best  you'll ever have. Our server was gone for long stretches and never brought the coffee I ordered later in the meal. I also felt she wasn't real attentive most of the time. We saw her a handful of times...but she was gone for long stretches when we could have used some water, etc. they were busy...but she would simply walk by without even looking our way. All in all, I would say Big Ed's is okay. The food and atmosphere is so good that my hope is that they will iron out their issues and the service will catch up to the rest of the place. A busy brunch on a Sunday so close past their grand opening doesn't paint a full picture.*Update. Had bad service the next time too. They are not getting it right. Realized that the cashiers at the door never ask how everything was. I can only guess it's because they don't care."

We were not disappointed. The food was amazing. We had dinner one night, and then lunch twice after. Food was delicious. The best part is that we were on a tight schedule, and so one day we called in our order ahead of time  (to dine in) and when we arrived, the food quickly followed. Staff was very attentive and more than happy to help us get in and out quickly at lunch."
2015-11-01,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Big Ed’s North,"Blehhh! I was excited to try this place and I felt extremely let down. Silverware=dirty. Their country ham couldn't have been rinsed at all... Too salty for consumption & the manager acted as if I was supposed to pay for something that was inedible because the menu says country ham is salty. Uhmmm, I'm not new to country ham but that was ridiculous & I wasn't going to pay for it- luckily they switched it out for turkey sausage because this fight would not have ended well. Even my cousins beef bologna was salty, please clean your grill! Best thing was the biscuits. Won't be back. Food and customer service were unacceptable!"

2015-11-01,5.0,"Seattle, WA",Red Pepper Asian,"After a couple of very disappointing visits, I barely can give this restaurant 2 stars.  I feel obligated to rate it though, as the highly inflated ratings are totally not deserved at all from my perspective.  I definitely expect so much more from a restaurant of this type.   Even though it is hard to get great Chinese and Asian food in the area, this place seems to fall way short of other places we prefer in the Triangle.  It seems as if they are more concerned about collecting money here while delivering small portions, mediocre food, and service, instead of putting any love, passion, and care into their food and service.We ordered multiple dishes, most that came out greasy, loaded with salt and/or msg, and left me and my wife feeling kind of crumby afterwards.  The soup was almost exclusively broth with very little else in it, and nothing we ordered was memorable enough to want to come back.The service was also forgetful and mediocre at best...  It's a definite pass for me..."

2015-11-01,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Taverna Agora,Absolutely the best meal I have had all year. We started with pita bread and spicy Feta cheese dip and fried calamari. Both were absolutely delicious. I had the lamb shank which just melts in your mouth my wife and daughter had scallops in orzo pasta. It was superb. Our server was excellent as well.
2015-11-01,5.0,"Holly Springs, NC",Trophy Brewing Company,"Normally when I visit Trophy Brewing, it is always slammed but we lucked out this weekend.. Probably because we were out around dinner time on Halloween night. Beer - Boyfriend and I started off with a flight that included all of the beers - Participant, Milky Way, Slingshot, Double Death Spiral, Wit-tea-est and Big Boss Harvest Time. My favorites were the Participant, a Berliner Weisse, Double Death Spiral, a delicious DIPA, and Wit-tea-est, normally I do not like beers brewed with tea but this one was great. Food - We started off with an order of the meatballs, this included four HUGE meatballs. I thought that they were good but I probably would not order them again since they were a bit too spicy for my liking. Then we split three 9"" pizzas, The New Kid, Best Dressed and Most Outgoing. My ranking for the pizzas - Best Dressed, by far the BEST pizza on the menu, The New Kid followed by Most Outgoing, it was a close race though.. Local + fresh ingredients = amazing pizza.Of course I would return!"

Service was pretty good and sitting outdoors near the fire was cozy.  We noticed a woman slip her dog into the bathroom with her.  Not a service dog either.  Not sure how that slipped by the employees working indoors of the restaurant. I love dogs, but this a big no no..For this alone, I'm not sure I'll hurry back.."

2015-11-02,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tijuana Flats,"You know what, Tijuana Flats while not being the best Tex-Mex eats out there certainly does a fantastic job when it comes to service. I stopped in on National Taco day and the place was MOBBED. Kids and families everywhere for discount $2 tacos with $1 drafts, are you kidding me?And even with the crush of people and food flowing out of the kitchen, the manager and staff were exceedingly nice and professional which is usually the case at Tijuana Flats. The Tex-Mex eats here are just OK but the service? Excellent. And at these price points a total surprise..."
2015-11-02,5.0,"Durham, NC",Jimmy V’s Osteria & Bar,"Jimmy's was only a 3-star experience for me. I got the braised short rib ragout. The meat was tender and the portion size was ample (as it should be for $28), but overall the taste of the dish didn't come together for me. The olives and red peppers made it taste more Chilean than Italian. Don't order this dish unless you really like olives. Our waitress was nice, but she looked like she had just come from soccer practice. When I'm paying $28 for an entree I expect servers to look a bit more put-together."
2015-11-02,3.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Sawasdee Thai Restaurant,"GOOD.This is likely the best Sawasdee if you're wondering.The service here isn't the best, but it's better than the Chapel Hill location, also they never run out of tofu.I love love love their tofu. The food is fresh, there are veggie options and avoid the greasy pad thai. I love how the rice comes in the shape of a crown or heart--adorable!The waiter would barely walk over to us and I had to crane my head when she asked if we needed anything. Come on now...do you want a nice tip? I want to give a big fat tip!Inside it's fun, divey and comfortable, it's a very small restaurant and I would not bring a big party of guests here.They need to hire more staff, when we were eating there on a Sunday there was one waitress in the entire restaurant.They are next door to a nice Asian food store!"

2015-11-02,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Rockford,"I am leaning more towards 3.5 stars but because of the delicious food I'm rounding it up. I've been a big fan of The Rockford for years, I've had numerous celebrations here and always enjoyed the food and atmosphere. After a long hiatus I came in for dinner on Halloween. I was shocked that the restaurant was completely empty, yes it was Halloween but on a bustling night in Glenwood South you would think they would have a crowd. We were one of two tables with a couple of guys at the bar. We were greeted by the host/waiter and seated immediately. Then we waited and waited, it was really strange considering the guy who sat us was also the waiter yet waited at least 15min to come get a drink order, it was so bazaar I have no idea what he was doing. By the time he came back we were more then ready for a drink and some food. We placed our order and waited on our cocktails. Besides the long wait times the food was really good. For an app we had the risotto cakes, extremely tasty. My friend ordered the shrimp and grits and I had the short rib quesadilla which I really enjoyed.  The spicy chipotle sauce on the side was so yummy.I don't know the weird vibe and service totally through me off, the only way to describe it is awkward. I definitely think there has been some changes in management here. Again food is still solid maybe it was just an off night."

First, and most importantly, the restaurant was incredibly clean, second despite being fairly busy our waitress was amazing she really made us feel special events though there were only two of us and she had bigger tables, she didn't rush us out either, it was my birthday dinner so my husband and I ordered a lot and took our time I know she would have liked to turn the table over but she never showed a sign of it while she was serving us. Lastly the food was phenomenal! We had three different appetizers ramen and three or four sushi rolls, each thing that came to our table was better than the last! Definitely food on par with Án in cary. In all a fantastic experience I highly recommend this place."

2015-11-02,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",P.G. Werth’s,"So excited to have found a new brunch spot! P.G. Werth's went above and beyond in customer service and serves up some delicious eats!First off, the restaurant itself is open and inviting with lots of natural light and a simple yet contemporary décor. It wasn't busy at all for Saturday Brunch which surprised me but worked out in our favor for the afternoon. The host was an absolute delight, I wish I could remember his name because he was genuinely so nice and accommodating but hope to see him at my next visit. Not only did he switch our original table to a larger one where our party of 6 would be more comfortable, he kept me company as I waited for the rest of the party (not in a creepy way, but more as a genuinely nice gesture). The rest of the staff were so nice as well, I really wasn't expecting such amazing customer service but very satisfied with P.G. Werth's staff! During our brunch we were greeted and checked on by four different people (host, two different wait staff, and a chef) which goes to show that they really work as a team here.The food... oh the flavors, the southern-style menu, the spicy blood mary... just thinking about it all makes my mouth water. We ordered the calamari cocktail and NC sweet fingerlings from the munch menu to start. I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce that came with the calamari but was happy with the actual calamari. It was nicely fried, not overly fried with some simple seasonings so you really can just taste the calamari.The NC sweet fingerlings were sweet potato wedges that were seasoned and glazed to perfection, definitely a crowd favorite! I ordered the Southern Benedict and was very happy with my choice. The gravy, biscuit, fried green tomato, and poached egg all paired so well together! I loved that my eggs were poached correctly and that the dish came with their hash bites which I'd describe as a mix between hash browns and hushpuppies--looks like hushpuppies but has that potato taste and flavor. I was a bit put off by the fact that the green tomatoes were more firm than I expected, and by firm I mean that they had a bit of a bite to them... In the past when I've had fried green tomatoes they've been more soft so I'm not sure what happened there, but everything else on the plate was delish! They do serve bottomless mimosas for $11. I didn't partake but several people in my group did and never saw the bottom of their glasses--always a good sign. I ordered their blood mary and really enjoyed it but I like my bloody mary with a kick :) Overall, I thoroughly  enjoyed my brunch experience at P.G. Werth's and will be recommending them to anyone asking for any good brunch restaurants in the area. Can't wait to return to try out more delicious dishes and potentially partake in the bottomless mimosas :)"

2015-11-02,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sawasdee Thai Restaurant & Bar,"Fellow Yelper, Ron, recommended Sawasdee when they opened and that was like a million years ago I think. Seriously though, I'm not sure what took me so long to check the place out, other than I'm not generally over on Glenwood Ave that often.We were itching for a mix of sushi and hibachi and their menu was just the ticket. It's ridiculously extensive. To the point, Chef Robert Irvine would give them a strong talking to about food costs, but hey I appreciated the variety.We ordered soup, salad, a sample boat, and hibachi steak to split. While service was crickets..... slow, the food was delish! I couldn't complain about a thing. Everything was very tasty. The wicker seats were extremely uncomfortable though. Even my 6'6"" boyfriend looked like a midget in them. I stole a cushion from another chair just to try to get my head above the table. They need to be tossed in the trashed and the whole place needs a refreshing up in my opinion. The ambience doesn't do the food justice.Now it's not gourmet and I wouldn't go running to take your date there tomorrow, but it's solid faire I would go back to."
2015-11-02,4.0,"Durham, NC",Sawasdee Thai Restaurant & Bar,Sushi was okay. Thai was better. They are a thai restaurant and should just stick with that.  They also need more staff.

2015-11-02,4.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Lilly’s Pizza,"The best pizza I've had in the triangle area since I've moved!! I've heard of Lily's and finally ordered two slices to go for lunch. The lines were long to even get take out, so if you're in a rush I wouldn't recommend coming here. When I say ordered two slices, I really mean half a pie, since the slices are huge! They were more than generous with their portion sizes. I got cheese pizza, and a slice with mushrooms and truffles on it. This pizza was delicious! The pizza tasted fresh and hot. It really made me feel it came right out of the oven. The sauce and crust has a sweet taste to it, which I am obsessed with. It was different than your normal pizza crust, and it was a pleasant change. The veggies were cooked perfectly. The seasonings and cheese had my mouth watering for more with each bite. I can't wait to go back to Lily's to try more of their speciality pizzas. I'll definitely be back here sooner than later."
2015-11-02,5.0,"San Diego, CA",Irregardless Cafe & Catering,"As a born & raised California vegan, I had serious reservations about visiting North Carolina. In my mind it was going to be a backwoods, all-you-can-eat, butter & fried pig ears marathon-- Irregardless blew my unfair misgivings out of the water. If you find yourself anywhere near Raleigh, visiting this restaurant is a must. To begin with the atmosphere is charming from the second you enter. My visit was on Halloween so the staff was in costume-there was a banana sitting at the bar and 2 kittens at the hostess desk! There is a great stage and we had the pleasure of listening to a live guitar and bass during our meal (at a very reasonable volume).The service is absolutely top-notch. Our waiter, Dylan, helped us choose dishes based on our dietary requirements, his tastes and the collective recommendations of former guests. He was attentive and a pleasure to interact with. When I asked if they had any T-Shirts available for purchase he went in back and his manager fish out the only one they had! Delicious food aside, I would go back again because of his service.Now, the food. I wish that I could nap in a bed of their warm pita bread. It was served with amazing, fluffy hummus, so fresh it melted in my mouth and topped with kalamata olives. For dinner I had the Stuffed Acorn Squash- I highly recommend this dish to anyone with a sweet tooth. It's complimented with sweet beets & black beans as well as white beans with pineapple (what a brilliant twist!). My husband, who indulges my vegan ways, had the Chile Relleno and was beyond pleased. It wasn't too spicy and was the perfect portion size. We devoured our meals happily and when the check came were pleased with how well priced everything was. This will definitely be my last stop before I leave Raleigh next week!"
2015-11-02,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Stanbury,We love Stanbury and always find something unique on the menu to try. Beef marrow on their amazing bread was a treat. The grilled Caesar salad is terrific. Reservations are a must however we sometimes sneak in at 6pm and eat at the bar.

This is still one of the best places with a ""back in the day"" vibe and still keeps the long tradition alive today. I do miss the old Pin-Ball Machines and Foosball games we frequented. The essence of this cool little Bar and Restaurant lingers with those fond memories. The bar is excellent and the properly priced food speaks to the frugality of the regular student crowd. Still keep coming back here because Mitch's Tavern somehow becomes a part of you and that feeling must be renewed frequently."
2015-11-02,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Buku,"We REALLY wanted to love this place. As a world traveling foodie, I was excited about the concept of this restaurant. My first impression was that there's a disconnect between the upscale ambiance and the street food theme. There's nothing fancy about street food; simplicity, ingredients and sense of place is what makes it beautiful. BF had the samosa pot pie. Folks, a sheet of puff pastry set on top of a mound of lukewarm hash does not a pot pie make! The hash was dry, lacked flavor dimension and was not visually appealing. I had the bibimbap. The presentation was colorful and the ingredients were fresh. The barbecued beef was done perfectly. I would have been more impressed if it were better than the food truck version I had a few weeks ago in Asheville. Perhaps eating out of a takeout container with plastic utensils while sipping a local beer with my man at my side and our dog at our feet in the fresh autumn air is what lent to that culinary experience. Which serves to my point. The beauty of street food is not only the cuisine itself, but the place in which you enjoy it. While it is a noble goal to try to wrap that experience up in a restaurant, i'm just not sure it can be done successfully. Buku tries, but most with global street food experience would say that it's a miss."

2015-11-02,5.0,"Durham, NC",Coquette Brasserie,"I had such high hopes for Coquette. The space is beautiful, and makes you think you're in a larger, more cosmopolitan city. But the food does not live up to the decor's standards.On my first visit (late afternoon on a weekday) I just had coffee and dessert (blueberry clafoutis). It was very sweet - too much sugar in the batter - and we had to flag down a server even though the place was nearly empty.On my second visit I sat at the bar for brunch. The service was great this time despite the crowd. But they served me the worst croque monsieur ever. I wish I had taken a photo of it and/or sent it back, but I was so hungry and the place was so busy, I just wolfed it down, paid, and left. What they served me was 1 thin slice of ham (one slice!) and a bit of gruyere cheese between 2 barely toasted/grilled pieces of white Wonder bread, with some mornay sauce dumped on top, and a handful of mixed greens on the side.  This dish was not acceptable and not worth $11."
2015-11-02,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Flying Burrito,"The service was good, and our appetizer was great--Stuffed Avocado. If you've never had a warm avocado, this is the place to try one! A seared avocado half stuffed with seasoned ground chicken, onions, peppers, rice & black beans topped with melted cheese. Served with poblano aioli & chips on the side. The poblano aioli tasted a lot like regular mayo, but the dish itself was very good. For my entrée I had a Rooster Enchilada, and this is where things shifted to slightly disappointing. It was very bland. And for all I know, an authentic enchilada may be bland, but I'm used to something a little more flavorful. It was served with rice and my choice of beans and was only $4.50, so really, how good does it need to be? I joke! Your food should always be good, but it is a matter of personal taste. Although I didn't try one, their Margarita menu looked great. I'll try this place again and order something other than the enchilada!"

2015-11-03,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Black Cat Cafe,"Really diverse cafe and comfort foods menu - including daily soups and 1/2 sandwich and choice of sides combo options for just $7.Tucked quietly into the back of the Lassiter side of shops at North Hills, you have to look for this place, but it's worth it. Inside you'll find a super friendly staff, food brought to you table (after ordering at the counter) and even a nice selection draft beer and wine, unexpectedly.The only complaint I have, and it's not much of one, is that I ordered the chick-less pot pie - expecting a vegetarian take on the traditional pot pie - and basically got a fancy faux-chicken and vegetable stew for $10. The portion was small and  wasn't really a pie. It was fantastic in taste, but underwhelming in value... I would just venture further around the menu next time, because I'll still be back.PS: They also offer great freebies on Stealz, including desserts and entire entrees when you've visited often enough, so download that app too and start racking up the points here."

It took over 45 minutes for our food to come out, while we just stared at our empty drink glasses.  The food was just okay - the attention to detail was completely gone.  Much as I gave up on trying to finish the burrito, I gave up on them.Fast forward a few years - we heard that they took that opportunity that they missed earlier to fix the menu. Fix?  No. They basically annihilated it. Your old favorites?  Most are gone.  Vegetarian?  One main dish to pick - eggplant on focaccia.  It was as unremarkable as you'd expect.  Some things didn't change: ""distressed"" decor that just looks unkempt, slow and disinterested service and too many tables in a small area."

2015-11-03,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Saint Jacques,"Luckily, we were on the company's dime for this visit. One soup, one snails, two entrees and three drinks $122 plus tip. Do NOT order the herb encrusted lamb, unless you are into extremely small portions of meat (5 wafer thin slices about 3"" x 1"") - perhaps the kitchen was running out? Not enough meat or herb crust to even get a glimpse of flavor, which was made even more bland by an undercooked risotto and stringy broccoli rabe. Certainly not haute cuisine! The only positive thing was the onion soup and the home made bread.  Decor is horribly outdated and drab. Restaurant was cold.  Wine very expensive $60+ per bottle. Do not be fooled by the website spouting about the French owner. He sold out to someone else, and he has an American head chef.  There really is nothing French about St. Jacques anymore. Sad.  Never again for us."

I'd come here years ago when I lived on this side of town for rainy-night takeout and remembered it being good but how good I'd obviously forgotten. Came here for lunchtime takeout. 8 minutes away from the restaurant, I placed my standard broccoli with brown sauce and white rice. For $1 extra, I ordered the wonton soup without the wontons and extra crispy noodles. The order was finished within 1 minute of arriving. When I got back to the office, I cracked open this wondrous meal for a working lunch. It was delectable indeed. The broccoli with brown sauce was brimming with a wonderful garlic and ginger flavor and perfectly seasoned. The white rice was fluffy and pillowy as it should be.  The won ton soup broth had a deep rich flavor that was well complemented by the fresh green onion and crunchy noodles. The portion was very generous leaving me with enough for dinner/next day lunch. This whole meal only cost me $7.54!!!! All in all it was a wonderful experience!  Best Chinese food I've had in Raleigh."

Great wine selection and the music is always good too.  Pricing not bad either!  Go now!

2015-11-03,5.0,"Wake Forest, NC",Shaba Shabu,"The three stars are for interiors, atmosphere, and service.  Haven't tried their thai dishes, but the sushi we ordered were not good, I would say below the average, the rice was hard and fell apart, the soft shell crab inside of our spider roll was cold and soggy, not crispy at all.  The appetizer we had was seafood roll, $6.90 for three finger-thick rolls was pricey, I would not recommend."

2015-11-03,5.0,"Cary, NC",DeMo’s Pizzeria & Deli,"The first time I ordered from DeMo's I was very underwhelmed. However, recently Clay reached out and wanted to make sure I had a better experience. A friend and I ordered the meatball garlic knot sliders and Montana pizza. Both were delicious and we received great service! The sliders still aren't my favorite, but I really enjoyed the Montana pizza. Potato chips on a pizza is just genius. Definitely recommend for delivery, but keep in mind it may take a while at peak times. The staff obviously care about their product and want to keep their customers happy."

2015-11-03,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kimbap,"Kimbap is a bustling yet cozy shop with a small menu but a lot of variety.  We sat at the bar, which faces the cooking area, so it was fun to watch each dish being made and plated - you could tell they loved their jobs and the entire staff was in perfect harmony.They offered us an amuse bouche - beets, cucumbers, and kimchi.  I hate beets more than you could imagine but I ate them all!  It was a perfect way to get us ready for the deliciousness to come.We split a kimchi pancake - one of my favorite indulgences and they made it to perfection.  The accompanying remoulade was a perfect sauce to step in for the typical soy sauce based ones.My friend ordered the wings and almost licked his plate clean.  I had a delicious Japchae dish and, although Korean food can be oily, this wasn't overly so.This gem is definitely on my list of places to go to when I'm around Seaboard Station.  There are so many more things on the menu I want to get around to!"

Big Ed's north did not disappoint! The grits were just right nice and creamy , I had catfish and my friends had the country sausage. the hash browns were crispy, everything was just right So good that we went back the next day!

Unfortunately  they do not! The also had Chicken wings that were very good as well, nice and crisp seasoned very well. Coleslaw good as well. Could not find anything wrong with my meal. If not from Raleigh it is off the beaten path but it's worth using your GPS for! Give it a try you won't be disappointed. Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it was off the beaten path other than that go for it!!"

2015-11-03,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Poole’s Downtown Diner,"They really bring out some special meals at Poole's. You can totally have a romantic date or enjoy a night with friends here. Perfect rainy night or after-show date spot. Poole's always has the best service! Most of the dishes here are truly fantastic and there is strong evidence of passionate cooking going on in the kitchen. Well known for having delicious and creative drinks as well. The food tends to be very rich and flavorful with a high dollar kind of appeal.  Have had a couple occasions where there has been way too much salt (mac n' cheese,mains meat dish), but that's the worst. There are always creative menus and even if it sounds weird or there is a food you are not fond of, they will put the perfect creative twist on the dish and you will love it."
2015-11-03,5.0,"Boston, MA",David’s Dumpling & Noodle Bar,"First time I had their food, it was quite good. I wish I could say the same on my send try. Order not as requested - ok forgiven, everyone makes a mistake. Then, they messed up white rice - way over cooked and mushy. Cheapest, easiest thing to do right. Now use the same white rice to make fried rice and you've basically got Chinese rice pudding. So after ordering $84 worth of Chinese takeout, I had a $2.50 Asian noodle soup from Fresh Market ... Sad to say, that was better... Dilemma: in a ""city"" with limited Chinese food options, do you try again or write it off? Or, is the third try the charm?"

I try to come here as much as I can when I'm in Raleigh for work.  I recommend it to everyone, especially the people who think Vegan food isn't delicious, it will change the way you feel about food!"
2015-11-03,3.0,"Durham, NC",Driftwood Southern Kitchen,"After seeing multiple pictures on instagram from local accounts, I put this place on my must-go list. That mac and cheese and chocolate bourbon pecan pie just drew me in. My boyfriend and I decided to head to Raleigh last-minute on Halloween night since we didn't have other plans. We had no idea what Lafayette Village was were pleasantly surprised when we saw all of the shops. We had time to pop in a couple before our dinner reservation. The whole area was extremely cute, although pretty dead, I am assuming since it was Halloween. We definitely want to go back when we have more time to browse around and try some of the other restaurants. I would think this place would be pretty crowded on a normal Saturday night, but not Halloween. Lucky for us! The decor is amazing in there. Really cool environment and they paid attention to every single detail from the bathrooms to the place card holders on the tables, to the airplants. I thought it was a unique touch that they bring you pork rinds at the beginning of the meal instead of bread. Our sever was super nice and helpful although a little slow, but we were in no hurry so not a big deal. I think she was pretty new. They had a special on bottled beer, so I tried a couple different ones. Their cocktails looked really good though, I might do that next time. We started with the pimento cheese plate. It was amazing! The pimento cheese was so creamy. It also came with pepper jelly, pickles and bacon jam. It was my first time having bacon jam and it might be my new obsession. They served with plain Carr crackers, which was great because you could focus on the spreads. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich and it was HUGE. There might have been an entire chicken on there. It was perfectly fried and it had candied jalapenos and bacon jam (yes!) on top. I got a side of collard greens so I could share mac and cheese. The collards were so good. Perfectly seasoned and a great compliment to the sandwich. My boyfriend got the brisket philly, which was good too. I liked mine a lot better. The mac and cheese was delicious. After that colossal meal we wanted dessert, but took it home to break up the marathon eating a bit. We got the chocolate bourbon pecan pie and pumpkin cheesecake. Both were delicious and served with homemade whipped cream. Will definitely be back!"

2015-11-03,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Standard Foods,"Love the dedication to supplying local foods in the grocery and the restaurant.  Blown away by the butcher shop/ charcueterie.  I'll never take the time to make soup stock and now I don't have to. Looking for source of fresh local (hard to find) meats? They've got it. Whole milk with cream? Got it.  I enjoyed the Ashe Co Cheese Company grilled cheddar cheese with FORAGED mushrooms (!), and got to try the drinking vinegars. Friends raved about the Crab Deviled Eggs, and the Apple Soup. Go to restaurant first, but save time to explore the grocery store-- it will take more time than you first think."
2015-11-04,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",El Tapatio Mexican Restaurant,"They have the best guacamole I can find anywhere in the Triangle, seriously.  The food is consistently good and hot and quick.  The salsa is spot on.  I eat here at least 3 times a month for lunch and sometimes after work for drinks and socializing.  One of the best places around.  I would give it 5 stars but while the service is great most of the time, when it isn't, it can be pretty bad."

It was my first time tasting grilled lettuce, but was very pleased with the salad. I will definitely be back to try their other menu items!"
2015-11-04,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mami Nora’s,"Wow, I can't believe I waited so long before trying Mami Nora's! I ordered takeout (so review is based solely on the food) on a dreary Saturday evening thinking the wait would be long. It was about 30 minutes, which is expected for a popular eatery on a Saturday night.  I totally got greedy and ordered a half chicken for myself along with yucca fries and the chicken noodle soup.  After finishing the soup and fries, I was already contentedly not hungry, but I knew I had to chow down on some of the chicken.  The chicken was everything all the other reviews led me to believe it would be.  So, so, so well seasoned! And tender and moist and just all together wholesome goodness.  The half chicken was enough for another small meal of leftovers for me so it was a great deal!  I'll have to come back and dine-in one of these days so I get the full experience!"

The service, although they are extremely nice and take good care of us, they can be slow. The food is always good and when they ask for a heat scale of 1-5 and you say 6 and then add some pepper oil to it the heat scale is pretty high! I've gotten the red and the green  curry and they haven't disappointed yet!"
2015-11-04,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Death & Taxes,"Suffice to say I did not expect to being giving Death & Taxes only 2 stars.  Living here for the last 15 years, I have visited every Ashley Christensen restaurant and been a huge fan.  When Death and Taxes was announced I was excited and knew it was a must try.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.  The concept is unique and I was hoping for better execution on a number of dishes.  I can say that the service was excellent.  We arrived earlier than our reservation time and they luckily were able to accommodate us.  Throughout dinner our server was knowledgeable and provided timely service even with the restaurant being full.  But even with great service the food has to be the star of the evening.  At Death & Taxes that was not the case.  I can understand if one or two dishes missed a beat but it felt like every dish that came out of the kitchen was lacking in flavor.  I got excited multiple times after reading the descriptions on the menu but then taking a bite out of the actual dish was underwhelming.  There is something wrong when butter beans in a dish are the best thing I ate when the star is supposed to be the meat.  My favorite dish was the corn which was perfectly cooked and had a burst of the flavor.  The steak was decent and cooked perfectly but again lacked flavor.  And I'm not even sure what The Pig dish was supposed to be.  All I could taste was collards instead of being able to enjoy the taste of delicious pork.  It is definitely pricey and I don't mind spending the money but on this day the food was not worth it.  While the ambiance and service was good, the food was just not up to par on this day.  I hope one day I can change this rating to more than 2 stars."

2015-11-04,5.0,"Austin, TX",42nd Street Oyster Bar & Seafood Grill,"I've eaten here before and enjoyed pretty decent results. Today was not one of those days. My fish/crab/lobster bisque had a shell, which is understandable. But couple that with the multiple shell pieces and grit I had in my Oysters Rockerfeller was just too much. I was so looking forward to yummy melted cheese atop a bed of spinach and my oyster. What I got was a humongous mound of spinach, literally 3 times the size of the tiny oyster with a sprinkling of not-a-bit melted shaker-style Parmesan cheese from a pizza joint. I mean, seriously. Just stick it back under the salamander for a bit. Service was quick and friendly, but it certainly wasn't worth the $30 spent."

2015-11-04,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Fiction Kitchen,"Tasty but a few critiques. My husband and I decided to go here for Halloween last Saturday. We normally hit up this area and had walked past it several times, the menu seemed interesting, so we decided to give it a shot. In past reviews, I read how there always is a wait for a table, so we were a bit shocked to find immediate seating, especially on a holiday night. First impressions is the restaurant is tiny, but can fit a decent amount of people, with booths, tables, and a bar. We came in around 7pm and were seated in the back by the kitchen and noticed it was a little dark. We were impressed by the different options on menu, from chicken and waffles to curry (all vegetarian of course). My husband wanted to try the pork but couldn't find anywhere on the menu what the meat substitute exactly was made from. Just a little note, maybe that should be added so a person doesn't have to ask the server. We settled on the peanut noodle bowl and pulled pork. As we waited, we couldn't help but feel singled out. All the servers were dressed in funny costumes, being friendly with other tables, but our server seemed very distant and blunt. I couldn't tell if she was new or if she was just in a bad mood (never heard her name, but she was wearing a red outfit, glasses, with CD's around her waist. Not sure what her costume was.). Aside from her lackadaisical attitude, she also didn't do very much; another waitress refilled our drinks and expo brought/took our plates from the table. Like I said, the restaurant was not busy at all so it's not like she was swamped. When we paid for the check, we asked for it to be split.. Took her almost 10 minutes at the computer to do this so honestly, I'm not sure what to think. As for the food, very tasty. The ""pork"" tasted like BBQ, very smoky and sweet. The produce was abundant and fresh, with huge chunks of radishes, zucchini and other veggies. Along the back wall is a chalkboard of all the farms they work with, so you know you're getting quality food. Also, the plates were nicely sized- I could always argue they could be a bit bigger, but I have seen some restaurants give you a salad bowl of food and call it a meal, so certainly we didn't leave hungry. I also understand the restaurant is about eating healthy, so gorging on buffet style plates wouldn't exactly reflect this motto. While the food was very good, I must say the price was a tad steep. We only ordered two meals and just drank water and paid over $35. Definitely not used to paying this much when there's no meat involved. We also went light, noticing some $20 meals, which I think is borderline crazy. I've been to vegan restaurants and when you're not outsourcing your products, there's just no need to be so overpriced. Perhaps it's just the location. Good food but a larger tab then we're used to and a waitstaff that felt lacking for us, we'll probably come back to give Fiction Kitchen another shot, but not for a while."
2015-11-04,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Driftwood Southern Kitchen,"Brunch was just .. ok. Brought an out of town guest with us and all of us left feeling like we'd missed the point of the whole restaurant.There was a sandwich board in the entrance and it talked about the specials of the day so we assumed there was a menu. The person who sat us (the weather was gorgeous so we asked to sit outside) didn't mention to any of us that it was only buffet at that time. And, she sat us at the table the farthest away from the main doors which we were to use to go in to the buffet (even though the waitress came in & out of doors right beside us - which, on the other side, were not behind the scenes but rather went right into the dining room).We were shocked at how little there was on the buffet and the flavors were just ""ok"".We will definitely come back for dinner ... want to experience more but not a great beginning to learning about them."
2015-11-04,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gonza Tacos Y Tequila,"Gonza has done it again!  Being a fan of their previous locations I was excited to try their new location on Hillsborough Street.  The new location is attached to the Aloft and across from the Bell Tower.  Can we say perfect location :)  I stopped by there for lunch yesterday and was seated promptly.  Mad kudos to our server who was on point throughout lunch.  She was friendly, attentive, engaged us in conversation, and was able to get me an order of one of my favorite dishes there, The Mexican Flag, even though it was not on the lunch menu!  The new location has the same vibe as the others and can't wait to go back to grab some drinks in the coming weeks.  The other thing that also stood out was the cleanliness of the place.  We constantly had someone come by our table to clear items, wipe it, and make sure everything was clean.  Looking around I also noticed the staff constantly cleaning and just overall providing great service.  I was impressed.  Gonza has both great service and delicious food!"
2015-11-04,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kamado Grille,"So I revisited Kamado in the hopes that I would be impressed, and I have to say they did do much better.  We came on a Monday night so the crowd was light, but I loved our experience guide/server.  He was great and I have to admit, I've never had so much soda refills done in one meal.  The food was also much better this time.  The pork bomb was a very hefty portion and we were ultimately unable to finish the pot pie or pork bomb.  I'm not a huge fan of the sauce/rub used on the pork....it's a very heavy spice that neither we nor the server could recall the name of.  I did love my chicken pot pie.  It came out in the cutest little cauldron and they made the top from flaky pastry dough which was delicious.  I wish they had wrapped the pie contents in the dough actually.  I would definitely recommend the chicken pot pie for a cold night--perfect way to warm up!  I'm much happier with my experience at Kamado, so I'll venture back to try more of their flatbreads and entrees!"
2015-11-04,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Babylon Restaurant,"I love this place! Fabulous outside dining. They served the best Moroccan Chicken that I've ever had. My son, who is so picky, said the steak was excellent. I would have given them 5 stars, but you get super small portions for high prices."

2015-11-05,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Borough,"The Borough is a great place for large groups to gather for appetizers and drinks. The service is fantastic, always polite and helpful, they never forget items and do well tracking large, fluid groups. My favorite meal item there is the ""Valhalla,"" which is a small filet mignon with broccoli and potatoes. It is filling and perfectly portioned and well priced. The ""Smattering"" is an appetizer plate with yummy hushpuppies that changed my life. There is other good stuff on there but I let my friends eat that so I can have all the pups. My vegetarian bff loves it there too. She gets a tofu sandwich thing. The drinks are outstanding as well. Very skilled bartenders who work quickly. The ""Nice Pear"" is my favorite, but you really can't go wrong. You may want to get a cab! The R line picks up right beside it and cabs are plentiful. Do yourself and your group a favor and start your night out there!"

2015-11-05,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tijuana Flats,"I've been to a few different Tijuana Flats in the area and they always exceed in service. And this location is no different. I've been to this location twice now and they have gone out of their way to open the door for us on our way in. This is not something I would normally expect from a counter service restaurant. When we ordered a dessert with our meal, they asked if we wanted it to come out after the rest of our food so that it was fresh. How considerate!  And then they kept an eye on us our entire meal so that they could fry up the cookie dough flautas at the right time. As for my main meal, I've tried the norrito bowl with carnitas and a couple of different tacos. The norrito bowl is really good. They have really fresh ingredients and you can tell the difference. But beware that the jalapenos are not the pickled kind! They are extremely fresh and hot (but good)! When I ordered the 'Dos Tacos,' they allowed me to choose 2 different types of meat, which was nice. While they were good, they didn't blow me away. A fun way to change up the flavor of your dish is to take advantage of their sauce bar! They have so many choices that vary from sweet to spicy. You are bound to find something you like.We have also ordered the chips trio, which comes with guacamole, queso and salsa. It was way more than we needed, but still a good choice! But the cookie dough flautas are the bestttttttttt! These are by far my favorite thing at Tijuana Flats. After trying them at a yelp event, I don't think I can ever go back without ordering these alongside my meal.So if you need a quick bite and still want great service, then try Tijuana Flats!"

I said, thank you to the owner's wife and once again she did acknowledge me or my thank you. It's like I had to make her speak. NEVER, EVER AGAIN WILL I GO BACK! The customer service is HORRIBLE!!!"

The service was......strange.  Our server forgot to bring us small plates and tried to take away the oysters before we were finished eating them!  There were a few other small issues, but easily overlooked.  Everything was just a little ""off"" with the service, but it didn't ruin our experience."
2015-11-05,5.0,"Durham, NC",Tasty 8’s,"I stumbled in Halloween evening for a late-night binge. Unfortunately there wasn't much binging due to their limited items. I came for the frites, however the moment I approached the counter they stopped selling them. There was a filled plastic bag of them sitting next to the deep fryer. They simply said ""We're out.""Getting passed the disappointment, the staff was friendly and apologetic despite dealing with (over) consumers' inhebriation. Segway: It would have been nice to have a system there (911) to get rid of the egregiously rowdy ones. One man in particular sexually assaulted a lady in front of us, bullied countless customers, cut the line, spit on the floor, looked through other people's food, and stole a fountain drink. I wouldn't have brought it up here if the staff didn't treat him as of he comes every week to assault customers. You're in the late-night food business: kick idiots out, please. I've traversed seedy parts of Paris at 4am and felt more safe.The dog was amazing, so you redeemed a ton of points. We're here for the food, after all. I got a Southern Comfort: it took about an hour to get, and about 10 seconds to consume. Not worth the money, but you have a monopoly on late night food for quite a few blocks.The way the drunk situation was handled and the fry cutoff still leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

2015-11-05,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bella Monica,"I've been to Bella Monica three times, and it is a very good Italian restaurant. The restaurant is small with outdoor seating, and the wait time can be very long without a reservation. The overall food is good, freshly made in house, and more authentic than your average Americanized Italian restaurant. We started off with the calamari and shrimp napoli. The calamari is not fried, but pan seared in a pesto sauce. It's pretty tasty and tender and the sauce is good. The shrimp napoli is amazing. They're jumbo sized shrimp baked in a cheese, bread crumb buttery goodness. The cheesy breadcrumbs bring the appetizer to another level. Although its a little pricey at $13, it's really good.I had the spinach stuffed shells for my entree, and they were very good and extremely cheesy! If you like cheese, order this dish. You get three humongous shells stuffed with fresh ricotta and spinach and covered with Italian gravy and more mozzarella cheese. The shells come out extremely hot, fresh out of the oven, and all of the cheese is melted to perfection. The red sauce is really good as well, and tastes really fresh, greatly complementing the mountain cheese you get. The best part is that the shells stay hot throughout your meal so you don't have to worry about the cheese getting too solid. I spent 20 minutes eating one shell and the other two shells were still very hot when I got to them. I would recommend this dish anyone that really loves cheese.For dessert I had a classic cannoli and it was really good, but really overpriced. You get one average size cannoli for $7. For this price you should at least be getting two. However, the cannoli was really good. The vanilla ricotta filling was very smooth and delicious, and the pastry shell was baked perfectly. There are other desserts such as the tiramisu that are more worth price than the cannoli.I enjoyed my meal at Bella Monica and would definitely come back. This is a great date restaurant, and they offer a bunch good pastas and flat bread pizzas. It's definitely around the top of my list for best Italian restaurants in Raleigh."
2015-11-05,5.0,"Orlando, FL",Raleigh Times Bar,Horrible service. Horrible food. OVERRATED. Felt out of place. Tried sitting on the patio upstairs but we were booted out of seats due to a private event later on that evening. Was expecting more out of this establishment as the interior had such personality.
2015-11-05,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Raleigh Times Bar,"Best bar downtown by far! Phenomenal service, excellent food and great drinks. Cheyanne and Jamie in particular have gone above and beyond to make sure my experience exceeded my expectations from beginning to end. Thank you guys! I will be back soon!"
2015-11-05,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Raleigh Times Bar,Some friends and I went to Raleigh times for dinner and the food was delicious but the service was sub par. Our waitress did not check on us often nor did she ask how our food was. Still a good burger though!
2015-11-05,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar - Seaboard,"Definitely some of the best burgers you can get in Raleigh!  Compared to other places in town, these burgers will definitely fill you up.  They are not fooling around with tiny patties here!  Their customization is awesome with a variety of cheese, toppings, and patty options including beef, bison, turkey, chicken, and black bean.  You need to get their buttermilk fried bacon while there... it sounds a little disgusting, but they taste amazing!  Besides the fried bacon, their sweet potato fries paired with a homemade mustard sauce were on of my favorite things.Parking can be troublesome due to all the businesses around that use that parking lot, but it is definitely worth it.  It's best to go early in the day because they do get really busy quickly."
2015-11-06,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Vivace,"Food and service was fantastic. Had the breakfast flatbread, it changed my breakfast life. Will definitely be back!"
2015-11-06,5.0,"Fayetteville, NC",BURGERFI,Best burger joint in town. Hands down.  This place has figured out how to make the food go from good to great. When I am up in Raleigh  I try and stop over here. The place is always packed and yet quality in never compromised.
2015-11-06,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Serena Sicilian Influenced Cucina,"Great people, great great great food.Not a huge fan of the alfredo. A little too much garlic. But that doesn't hurt their rating. Everything else on the menu is crazy good.Had an issue with a dish last time I was in. The manager literally couldn't have been more apologetic and accommodating. Keep up the great work, Serenas!"

2015-11-06,5.0,"Savannah, GA",Wakefield Tavern,The busboy constantly walking around looking for something to do is a little bothersome. Good atmosphere. Decent size crowd. Quesadillas were in point
2015-11-06,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Casa San Carlo Italian Restaurant,"We were seated quickly for a Saturday night,  the waitress was very nice and knew the menu.  The food - it was average - I had the lasagna and the only thing I could think is how could an ""Italian Restaurant"" basically have me thinking I need to make it so I can actually have real lasagna. My significant other had a dish that looked like it was drowning in ""Ragu""    Not much flavor overall - the rolls were good.  Ok wine selection.  I guess I have a different impression of what good Italian food."
2015-11-06,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Fu Kee Express,"Customer service is one of the main things that separate restaurants. And let me tell you, this place blew me away. One guy ran everything, but still took time out to converse. He even offered me a free drink while I waited for my food. Wow. It also helps when the food matches the service. He uses white meat, unfortunately rare for Chinese restaurants. Great first experience, which means future visits to come."
2015-11-06,5.0,"Apex, NC",Chubby’s Tacos,"Great carne asada tacos, but other than that, I've had better. If I do go back I'll stick to those, but I will not being trying the shrimp taco again and definitely not the chorizo. I felt cheated with amount of shrimp that came in the shrimp taco. I also prefer that my chorizo not be chopped/minced so tiny, but not a big deal. I was more so bothered by the amount of oil that came dripping out of my chorizo taco during each and every bite. Like I said, the carne asada tacos are good and worth coming back for. I just know of too many other authentic Mexican taco spots that may keep me away from Chubby's for quite a while."
2015-11-06,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kadhai The Indian Wok,"Came here for the Buffet for a grab-n-go during lunch-time. All of the hot trays were full and with lots of options to choose from the good ol' traditional Indian cuisine. Food was not very spicy, yet still aromatic and full of that bold Indian flavor many seek when going to Indian places.Most of the food available was vegetables, rice, noodles, etc.. Only few chicken options. They did mention that Lamb would be available on the weekend. Also a separate smaller cold buffet table was there with salads and a few other options.Price was around $9-$10 I believe per person, so not too bad of a deal for take-out."
2015-11-06,5.0,"Clayton, NC",Kimbap,I enjoyed my first visit to Kimbap a great deal and will be looking for another opportunity to dine there.  My friend had the pork belly rice bowl and it looked amazing. The pork was tasty! I had the fish special and it was also delicious.  Everything was beautifully prepared and delicious.
2015-11-06,5.0,"Apex, NC",Tupelo Honey Cafe Raleigh,Wow how could you not give 5 stars?Great location in Cameron Village! Sit at the bar.. Chat with the bartender..while sipping on the newest gin cocktail on tap and sharing a variety of small plates! Yum!!

2015-11-06,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gonza Tacos Y Tequila,"Yeah what can I say Gonza just knows what they are doing. Visiting Gonza in their first week of opening at this new location I was expecting some normal new restaurant jitters but what I got was perfect service and food.First off I love this new restaurant and love that I now only have to drive 5 minutes to visit one of my favorite Mexican restaurants. This Gonza is located adjacent to the new Aloft Hotel on Hillsborough st. We came in on a Tuesday evening with a party of 9 for a birthday (yes I made reservations). We were greeted by 2 friendly hostesses and were seated immediately. We started off with a few pitchers of margaritas, passionfruit and original. We all preferred the original but the passionfruit was a nice addition as well. The guac was incredible and you can't go wrong with some queso. I ate so many chips so decided to try the tuna ceviche as my meal. Oh man it was so good and spicy and the perfect amount of food. I heard a little rumor that they might make this a permanent menu item soon (PLEASE DO). Our waiter Jared was so friendly and accommodating to our large party. We let him know that we had a birthday and they staff came over singing and brought a blue shot for the birthday girl. Gonza really does a great job at making you feel welcome and as part of their family.Welcome to Hillsborough st. we are happy to have you Gonza!"
2015-11-06,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",MOD Pizza,"Fresh, fast and fun! Super neat concept of creating your own pizza where the price your pay is based on the size of the pie and not the number of toppings/sauces you chose. Kind of like Subway...but WAY better - because, well it's PIZZA!There is also a list pizzas that you can choose from where toppings/sauces are already pre-selected with the option of adding to them. Again, at no extra cost. Choose your size pie, pick your sauce/toppings and it's baked fresh for you. They also have local beers and dessert options! Thin crust is my favorite type of pizza, which is what they serve here so I'm a weekly customer :)  If you like pizza, you will LOVE MOD."
2015-11-07,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Black Cat Cafe,Great little restaurant.  Super friendly staff. Lots of interesting menu items.  They suggested the portobello mushroom sandwich.  DELICIOUS.  will definitely be back!!!
2015-11-07,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Cameron Bar and Grill,"Solid American bar and grille.  Menu has lots of burger options.  Had the Atlanta burger (pimento cheese and fried green tomato) with the sweet potato fries.  Very good.  Wife had chicken nachos, said they were good.  Waiter was nice and knowledgeable and accommodating.  Would come back again."
2015-11-07,4.0,"Clayton, NC",Humble Pie,"This is easily one of our raleigh faves. I love sitting on the patio in spring and fall and enjoying a margarita. Theirs are the best! Favorite dishes have to be the tetilla cheese, and shrimp and grits. So so good."
2015-11-07,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",La Carreta Mexican Restaurant,"We love this place. Granted, we live in the apartments connected to the restaurant, but they consistently serve up excellent food, margaritas, and service. Try the table side guacamole! It's awesome."
2015-11-07,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Randy’s Pizza,Love this Pizza!!! So glad to finally have a pizza delivered that consistently tastes good at a reasonable price. 45 mins. to an hour is definitely worth the wait.
2015-11-07,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Imperial Garden Chinese Restaurant,"This has always been our go to restaurant for Chinese food. Good tasting food at a moderate price. Ordered takeout from there last week and I have to say it was terrible. The chicken in the cashew chicken was absolutely tasteless and it was difficult to even eat the entree it tasted so bad. My husband had the Empress chicken which has a fried chicken in it and although it had some taste, it was chewy and very difficult to eat. Although the staff there is always very polite and service is quick, we will be finding a new Chinese takeout restaurant. The quality is just not what it used to be- very sad."
2015-11-07,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Taste Small Plates | Wine Bar,"Just enjoyed a delicious array of wonderful small plates, the Feta Bruschetta was perfection with small perfectly chopped tomatoes and balsamic drizzled crostini. The Artichoke vegetarian selection was incredible . My husband orders the cucumber mint martini made with cucumber and a hint of mint loved it ! Cool atmosphere nice decor definitely will return soon."
2015-11-07,5.0,"Avon Lake, OH",Bolt Bistro,"Went there last night with a party of 10.  Service was good and the food was absolutely delicious, from the Ahi Tuna to the Scallops, to the Shrimp and Grits and I could go on.  I would go back again."
2015-11-07,5.0,"Excelsior, MN",Taqueria El Toro,"Order at the counter and pick a table. Very casual, but hands down the best and most authentic mexican food I have had in this area. Carnitas are amazing, especially on their homemade corn tortillas. Tortillas are made right next door at the supermarket. Then pick a salsa at the salsa bar.Chips are fresh and homemade as well. Guacamole is fresh and excellent. The girl who took our order did not speak very good english but she got our order right.Most of clientele is hispanic, so you know its good and authentic. Cant wait to go back.Also discovered you can buy the carnitas next door at the supermarket!!"
2015-11-07,2.0,"Apex, NC",Death & Taxes,"This was really a 3.5 for us.  I wanted to love this place.  I had been looking forward to trying it for weeks.  We love Poole's, so had high hopes.  Hubby and I were joined by one of my BFF and her boyfriend. Made reservations four weeks ago for tonight.  So, was not loving the fact we were sat right beside the door and had to deal with the breeze all night.  But, I get it.  Someone has to sit at that table.  I just didn't want it to be me!  The space is very well done, but unfortunately they didn't plan on the acoustics of the restaurant and it is beyond loud.  Not just a hum, be a shout across the table to have a conversation loud.  Service was great, from hostess to our waitress.  Food was good, but just nothing really outstanding that will be bringing us back soon.  Hubby had the bone marrow and while he enjoyed it, felt the thyme was a bit overpowering.  I had the whole crab salad.  Lots of yummy crab topped with avocado and orange.  I would order this again.  It worked really well and I love crab.  We shared the mushroom, again also good.  And the potatoes.  Very cheesy.  Friends shared the beef, which was huge and they felt was good.  As you see, a lot of goods.  But, we we were all expecting a lot of greats!  Hubby and I shared the pumpkin dessert, eh.  Friends shared the dark chocolate and loved it.  Best part of the meal they declared.  I think this restaurant has potential, but they just need to work out some things first, figure out what they want to be.  Crab and bone marrow priced very fair (both around 15 for an adequate although not huge portion) sides and desserts are over priced unless they become more outstanding.  Our table found it amusing that our waitress originally was explaining the concept and menu as designed to be shared family style to try several things, but a few sentences later told us they weren't really portioned for sharing.  Hubby and I had plenty to eat with each getting one of the smaller options and two sides."
2015-11-07,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Ni Asian Kitchen,Fantastic!  Small place with nice atmosphere offering a limited menu of fresh foods. Superb service. Consistent quality dine in or take out.
2015-11-07,3.0,"Durham, NC",Soo Café,"A friend of mine mentioned this place and to be honest I didn't really have high hopes. I feel pretty knowledgeable about good Korean food and was a little skeptical. Boy was I wrong! This place is so good!!! As other reviewers had mentioned their chicken has this crackly sweet yet not too heavy quality that's so addictive and the price is reasonable given the size of their wings! My friend and I shared the 10 wing order and it was plenty. To boot, the staff are so friendly and helpful. I unfortunately was feeling under the weather when I went (being sick still can't keep me away from fried chicken), and the staff not only took notice but offered up all kinds of assistance and asked how I was feeling and anything they could do. So nice! The food alone was enough to keep me coming back but the friendly service and care will make me a loyal customer."

2015-11-07,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bahama Breeze,"This place has changed a lot but not for the good!  This place has gone down!  In both food, food choices and quality.  When they first came to Raleigh,  NC it was good. Not now! The beef patties were a favorite  not now.  They had a crab claw dish that was good,  now they don't have it. The jerk wings used to be huge and good and perfect for the price now not! I  won't be going back. The last few times were  not good!"
2015-11-07,5.0,"Virginia Beach, VA",Second Empire Restaurant And Tavern,"WOW!! Our experience at this tavern was  so amazing I literally only created this YELP to write this review on the Second Empire. They went all out for us!! The chef made a special menu dedicated to us newlyweds, he signed the menu, and our lovely waitress offered us a tour of the property. Our waitress went over the entire history of the house and answered any questions we had. The food was phenomenal! And I've never been to a restaurant where EVERY SINGLE PERSON (there were 8 of us) liked their food.  It was mind blowing, I had the Seafood Paella it was the best I've tasted by far. Upon leaving the restaurant I left my purse behind and Kyle, a waiter came running down the street just to bring it back. And after my mothers car wouldn't start, Kyle came out with jumper cables and helped us out. That's was mind blowing! I even took a photo with him to put in our wedding album. I am so impressed!!"
2015-11-07,2.0,"Washington, DC",Poole’s Downtown Diner,"I came here for dinner earlier this week with a group of 7 other co-workers while visiting Raleigh. It was recommended to us by another co-worker but probably not the best spot for large groups more than 4 as we probably waited for 30 - 40 minutes for a table and the area around the bar isn't that suited for standing around while their are other diners are seated at the bar trying to enjoy their meal. Ok ... onto the food! We ordered the pate, mac and cheese, pimento cheese, and beet salad to start. Ok... the mac and cheese was just to die for! We split one portion between 8 of us as an app then ended up ordering another as a side... it was that good! We also ordered the pate, the pimento cheese, and beet salad. I didn't have any of the pimento cheese as I didn't want to taint my palate for the m&c but others seemed to enjoy and the beet salad and pate were on-par. For my main meal I ordered the trout which I had really high expectations for but just didn't really knock my socks off. I trout is a more delicate fish but I definitely was left wanting more fish and less of the celery root puree. Others ordered the trout as well which they did enjoy, short ribs which was a little salty our friend said, and the scallops which looked really really good. I recommend stopping by with a small party definitely for the m&c and giving their entrees a go for your own-opinion."

2015-11-07,5.0,"Durham, NC",Raleigh Times Bar,"This place used to be one of my favorite restaurants in which to eat in downtown Raleigh.  I don't know what has changed recently but it was not for the better.The service was terrible.  It took 12 minutes just to get menus and another 11 to get our drink order in.  Neither my wife nor I received the drinks we ordered.  The server was testy and couldn't keep up with the tables he was assigned.The food was improperly cooked and lukewarm when it came.  Our appetizer, fried pickles,  arrived after the main course was delivered and came as a couple clumps of tangled, breaded pickle strips.At no point was an apology offered.  Done with this place."
2015-11-07,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",MOD Pizza,Very cool concept that is taking a page out of the custom pizza chipotle style build your own model. They have a number of toppings and crusts/sizes that include gluten free. The smaller size is definitely just that and too small for something to fill up on in my opinion. The pizzas are clay fired and come out quick and I think this place is going to be awfully successful. Parking is no problem since its in a strip mall and just look for the harris teeter when you're parking because if you don't make the right turn you have to go all the way around the block. Ill be back for sure.
2015-11-07,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",MOD Pizza,"Fast and convenient. We chose the mad dog (pepperoni, mild sausage and beef). The ingredients were fresh! This was my first time and we dine in.

2015-11-07,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Flying Burrito,They crammed 4 teenage mutant shrimps in a taco built for two and I loved every bite of it. I mean if these shrimp were any bigger they would have got ID'd at the bar.
2015-11-07,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Godavari Indian Restaurant,"This is the first restaurant review I have ever written. The food and service were so bad I am compelled to share. I am patient with the service in new restaurants as it can improve with experience/time, if the management cares. But, if the food is not good they are doomed. This place is doomed!  No cucumbers or seasoning in raita, watery chicken tikka masala, soggy cauliflower manchurian and plain steamed white rice. I will be dining at another proven Indian restaurant tonight to erase this experience from my mind and satiate my craving for real Indian food."
2015-11-07,5.0,"Colorado Springs, CO",Clouds Brewing,"Awesome awesome awesome. We stopped in for a beer and found that this place has the most amazing food around.

2015-11-07,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar - Seaboard,Probably the best burger in Raleigh. The Mama Ricotta burger is excellent if you like pesto. They have whole wheat buns and lettuce wraps if you are watching carbs. The create your own salads are very good as well. The only negative is their fruit is usually not ripe. Service is consistently very good.
2015-11-08,4.5,"Raleigh, NC",Papa’s Pizza & Subs,"Food was excellent. Customer service was above superior. I just finished my meal which was a steak and cheese pizza roll.

2015-11-08,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Margaux’s Restaurant,"I was there on Tuesday for their three course special. The atmosphere was nice, unique. Nice menu options and the food was great. My steak was cooked medium rare to medium when I requested medium well. Way too red. I had cut from the end and cut about 4-5 pieces. They took it back and cooked it more. They brought it back and it was cooked well done (not medium well). That's better than red but they still didn't get it right. I was most displeased, though, that they had had completely removed the pieces I had cut from my plate! So I ended up w probably a 4oz steak instead of the 6 oz or whatever size it was supposed to be. The waiter said he'd try to make it right, but never did. I still paid the price of the whole steak and got at best 2/3 of it.  The deal is good. The experience was average."

It was overloaded with garlic.  Definitely will not Return"

Their fried chicken wings are the bomb.com and don't even get me started on how yummy their wonton soup is! I'm not a huge fan of the fried rice but my go-to's are the fried wings and wonton soup. I have not branched out on their menu too much, but what I have tried deserves at least 4 stars and it's reasonably priced. I will continue to order from imperial garden."

First Watch is the perfect breakfast/brunch spot any day of the week or weekend. Several of my fellow Yeeps have called out the numerous healthy options available, and those are great...but let's get down to brass tacks here: they have about 9 different selections of pancakes that are phenomenal. ""Hold the phone, Anne-Marie...ONE pancake is $5. Why in the world..."" you might be thinking. I'll tell you why. They're as big as my torso, that's why. I recommend getting one and splitting it with the table...seriously. I also recommend the bacon cheddar if you're having trouble deciding. Add this to your list of places in Raleigh to give a whirl for brunch, no questions asked."

2015-11-08,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bahama Breeze,My husband and I went in for the Jamaican chicken wings and beers.  The bill came to 51.00.  The order of 8 chicken wings were 15.00 a piece and we had two orders plus beers and cocktail.  I'm sorry but 15. 00 for 8 chicken wing is way to much and they did even cut of the extra wing.

2015-11-08,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sawasdee Thai Restaurant & Bar,"Nice place for a date night. I tried the Thai iced tea (delicious). We sat on the back side of restaurant, the chairs are actually really comfy and I felt like vip back there. It was like a private area. Staff were great. We were warned it was busy because of 3 big parties, but our food didn't take long to come at all. I got pad Thai, my husband got pho. Food was really good, staff was great, and I enjoyed the atmosphere. If my husband and I go again, we will probably ask to sit in the back section. I recommend trying this place."
2015-11-08,4.0,"Holly Springs, NC",Calavera Empanadas And Tequila,"Absolutely unreasonable experience! We called to make reservations for party of 8 for a friends birthday. They told us reservations could only be made online so we proceeded to go online to fill out the ""reservations"" portion of their website. After filling out the form it told us to call in about the ""reservation.""  So we called back in and were told a reservation may or may not be held for you (which doesn't lineup with my definition of a reservation). We were told we'd need to speak with a manager but no, the manager on duty would not be able to help. It might go through though so just come in. We proceeded to go for our 8pm reservation and were told they didn't have anyone on the list for 8 pm. We could sit outside if we want too. So we sat outside for 20+ min after having an employee walked by twice including stopping once to pick up the glass and tab from the table next to us without stopping we left. We walked down the street to Jose and Sons and loved the food, experience, and drinks. Go to Jose and Sons not this horribly run establishment! Food and service was amazing. They don't take reservations but got our party of 8 sat on a Saturday night in 30 mins."
2015-11-08,4.0,"Ann Arbor, MI",Kai Sushi and Sake Bar,Have dined here multiple times. Really good selection of sushi and most of what I have tried has been tasty. Service is generally good as well. If anyone is in town and looking for sushi I would recommend this place.
2015-11-08,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Vinos Finos Tapas and Wine Bar,"Wine was very good and reasonably priced, but the service was seriously lacking. We sat outside and our server brought us one round of drinks before disappearing and never returning. We eventually asked another server for another round, and later had to flag the same one down to get checks."
2015-11-08,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bahama Breeze,Bahama Breeze what can I say nice menu cute tropical decor great place for family dinner or date night or a place to scope out potential dates for the 30 plus crowd at the bar lol but seriously I get the buttermilk chicken every time it's amazing two chicken breast over mashed potatoes with spinach and a buttercream sauce ask for extra sauce to began with (thank me later) they also have a really good rack of ribs and the fire cracker shrimp are good (good appetizer portion) well can't go wrong here with all the menu options
2015-11-08,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Nashers Sandwich House,"Loved Nashers, will be back very soon. These sandwiches are not for the faint of heart. They're aggressively creative and could easily serve as 2 generous meals. My BBQ pork on hearty Ciabatta, topped with coleslaw and served with a side of delicious shoestring fries knocked my socks off. I'm adamantly opposed to soggy bread, so whoever chose this bread to go with this sandwich was thinking of me. It easily sustained the creamy coleslaw and other sauces perfectly to make the whole sandwich an enjoyable experience. I can't remember exactly what was in the dipping sauce for the fries, but think Zaxby's sauce and you're on the right track in terms of flavor. Delightful. This location is a little ways out of the way for me (which I didn't realize when I chose this spot for lunch one weekend after church), but it's well worth it. Great food, friendly staff, cute little dining area (indoor and outdoor options available)."
2015-11-08,4.0,"Morrisville, NC",Plates Neighborhood Kitchen,"Really enjoyed dinner!  Food was really good, and ambience was cosy and relaxing.  I would recommend Plates for a nice dinner after work (or any day) --- you can visit and hear each other."
2015-11-08,3.0,"Aylett, VA",Bahama Breeze,"Love going to this chain.  Our server, while busy was very attentive.Had a dish with fried chicken spinach and tomato. It was to be on a bed of mashed potatoes, but I really love their cinnamon sweet potatoes so I substituted that. It was definitely not something I was expecting, as the spinach was actually spinach dip and the tomato was a tomato, corn, black bean relish. And the cheese that was supposed to top it instead of being a mozzarella or something mild was a queso dip cheese. While the dish was good, it would have been much better had the sweet potatoes been on the side instead of beneath the chicken. My mom had grilled chicken with a cilantro crema sauce and she said that was amazing.For a small plate, we have the conch fritters. There was a lot of filler, but the sauce that accompany the conch fritters was amazing and the vegetables in the actual fritter were very good and tender.We ended our meal with key lime pie and though we're not fans of meringue it was very light and fluffy.As for drinks, my mom got the ultimate piña colada that was to be layered with strawberry ice, instead it came out Brown and did not taste like a pina colada. It tasted okay, just not what she was expecting after reading the description. I had the pain killer which was well blended in typical of a normal pain killer drink"
2015-11-08,4.0,"Williamsburg, VA",Poole’s Downtown Diner,"The dining experience was unique and unlike any I've had before.  I loved how the menus were written on the blackboards.  It made me feel like everything I was eating was fresh and seasonal.  The layout is also really interesting.  The bar dominates the space, yet it still feels intimate and inviting inside.  When we went, it was extremely crowded, and after a 40 minute wait (which we didn't mind, as we walked around outside), we were seated at the bar.  After we made it obvious we weren't going to order drinks, we were reseated at a table for two.  We didn't mind either way, but it's nice that the servers are so aware of these details!  The food was absolutely incredible.  The portions were a good size, and the items were extremely creative.  We got mac and cheese, which almost every table got to share.  The mac and cheese is decadent and fairly priced.  The entrees were homey and down to earth-- we got the rabbit pot pie and the short ribs.  I loved it.  We were too stuffed for dessert, but we hope to make it back!"
2015-11-08,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Lynnwood Grill & Brewing Concern,"Uneven service, sub-par food, noisy. Not worth the hassle- I think the theatre keeps them afloat.More detail: we walked in a bit before 5, and there were about 5-6 people at the hostess stand chatting and they all turned to us.  I was waiting for someone to greet us to know which was the host, and I finally said ""uhm... table for 3?""The waitress walked up to us and before greeting us, just pointed at my friend's eCig and said, ""you can't do that in here.""  Not a graceful opener, but it never devolved into rude service, just was... uncomfortable.She didn't know their LBC-branded beers very well, but was willing to go ask the bartender all our questions.  I settled on one that was listed on the board but was not on tap at the time... so I had to pick something else.We split pickle chips (greasy - had to blot each one off with a napkin) and a specialty pizza.  It had the basics - garlic, mushrooms, peppers, spinach and feta.  It was also extremely salty.I'm glad to see a locally owned business thriving, but this one didn't sit with any of us very well."
2015-11-08,4.0,"Cary, NC",Oak City Meatball Shoppe,"Had a nice casual lunch here with a friend midweek. We both had the Sliders. Pesto with Chicken, Spicy Pork with the Parmesan Cream sauce, and the special. sun dried tomato with Sun dried tomato sauce. All were delicious but the pork was my favorite. Prices were really reasonable and service was very friendly. Definitely worth going back again."
2015-11-08,5.0,"Rancho Santa Margarita, CA",Poole’s Downtown Diner,"So the place is in a very run down area and I was aprehensive to go in at first but let me tell you the food was absolutely perfect.  I had the trout and loved it.  They have a great desert too.  Please make sure to attend and you will love it.  By the way, go early because this place fills up fast so you may not get a seat if you go late."
2015-11-08,5.0,"Richmond, VA",Chuck’s,Great service. The carolina burger was amazing. Portion sizes are PERFECT. And you get two sauces plus ketchup! Traveling thru nc and im glad we stopped here! Peanut butter banana milkshake was also delicious.
2015-11-08,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Poole’s Downtown Diner,"Expect to spend a lot for food that is overrated. Best part of the meal was my beet salad. It had great flavor. Beets w burrata and prosciutto was good. Next up was tomato pie. Crust was heavy, tomatoes were huge. Cheese was overpowering Ordered the Mac and the cheesy crust was good, but it was homemade Mac. Nothing spectacular. Brussels sprouts in brown butter looked as if doused in gravy. Too much saucy brown butter. Hubbys trout was good. He says he won't be seeking it out again though. Waitress was lovely, it was the food that underwhelmed."
2015-11-08,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",First Watch,Every time my family and I eat here we are just blown away! The service is spectacular! Everyone is so friendly and eager to serve you. All the ingredients are so fresh and flavorful. Today I had the beefeater sandwich and the Italian wedding soup. My wife had a salad with butternut squash bisque! Such a great place to eat!
2015-11-08,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Busy Bee Cafe,Watched the game there.  It wasn't ideal for game watching but it isn't a sports bar.  The beer selection was fun.  I found while my grilled chicken was good it was a bit overpriced.  I would go back to try some more of the beers and try maybe one of their signature dish.  Too interesting not to.
2015-11-08,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Driftwood Southern Kitchen,"Great service and delicious food. A former New Yorker, I finally got up the nerve to try cracklins' and was pleasantly surprised. The grilled salmon with a farro, mushroom, and arugula salad was incredible."
2015-11-08,5.0,"Durham, NC",David’s Dumpling & Noodle Bar,"OMG! This place is delicious. I went with a group of seven, and someone had selected this as the place to eat. I didn't know much about it wandering in, but the menu looked interesting.We were seated promptly and had great service. Drink orders were taken and filled quickly Food was ordered and delivered in a good amount of time.There were a couple of apps floating around our table. I didn't order any, but I tried the half-fried dumplings someone had ordered. They were perfect and almost melted away in my mouth.For my meal, I had the roast pork and dumpling egg noodle soup. Our server said this was a great noodle soup to get. She was totally correct. You get a very generous portion of soup (plus, David brought mine out to me!). I could have brought half of it home, but it was so good that I kept cramming it in and ate about 80% of it.The soup had layers to it so it seemed like I was always discovering something new and yummy to it. I first made it my mission to eat all the dumplings. Once those were gone, I moved on to eating the noodles. The noddles were thin, and they were perfect. The woman next to me had ordered the same dish and couldn't stop raving about the broth.Everyone at the table was very satisfied with their meal.On the way out, I stopped and talked to David telling him how much I had enjoyed my meal. He is very friendly and seemed to enjoy chatting. So if you go (and you should!) make sure you take time to talk to him."
2015-11-08,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Yard House,"I was considerably more impressed with Yard House than I expected to be. The couple dining with me was not so fortunate.A few things:1) I would not classify this restaurant as ""family-friendly"". In case you're interpreting ""Yard House"" to mean ""shed"", the name should give this away. The focal point of this restaurant is a rather impressively sized bar, surrounded by booths. I'd recommend this for an adult evening, not a bring-your-kids-out-in-public evening. 2) Don't get the guacamole. You will be disappointed in every category (portion/cost/taste/presentation). The menu experience at my table was an even split. My kale Caesar and Ahi poke bowl with a side of truffle fries, washed down with a Moscow Mule were all superb. The opposing side of the table's fish and chips were bland (I'm told the dish was too heavily reliant on the side sauce to tie it together). The aforementioned guac was also a total miss. There were about 2 tablespoons of guacamole and maybe 7 chips to dip. Given the price, we were all surprised.I can't say I won't be back (especially for those truffle fries...I even asked for a to go box which I rarely do), but it'll probably not be first on my list of 2nd time around restaurants in the area. All in all though, I'd say give this place a shot (and leave your kids at home)."
2015-11-08,5.0,"Morrisville, NC",Buku,"I've been here 3 times.First time was for brunch about a year ago.  It was good, but I prefer Brasa in Brier Creek.Second time was to try the pho.  It was awful.  The staff acknowledged this and did what they could to make it right.  No complaints there.Third time was this past Friday for dinner.  It was wonderful!  The service was very friendly and attentive.  I had the Chilean Sea Bass, which was delicious."
2015-11-08,3.0,"Lawton, OK",Godavari Indian Restaurant,"I really enjoy this place so far. I have only ordered take out, as I live about 30 seconds from it so it's been great. I never ate at Swad because the meat wasn't halal and the vegetarian dishes didn't really peak my interest too much. However, I really enjoy the menu here as there is a wide variety of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food. The owners have verbally confirmed all meat is halal and there is a halal sticker on the front door for those who care. I eat meat but go through periods of vegetarianism and their non-meat options are great.  I read the reviews that the service can be slow if you eat inside, but for me this is now a standard take out place. I tried it the first time three nights ago and went back for seconds the following night and had to resist ordering again last night. . **Although this could have been a one time mistake, I would not give out your credit card info over the phone. The guy at the front was taking a phone order in front of me and asked for the customer's credit card with expiration date, 3 digit code, and pin for debit. He repeated all of the numbers out loud not once, not twice, but three times in front of me and whoever else was in the front waiting area. He also wrote all this down in plain view for everyone to see. I'm sure it was an honest mistake and I would never steal someone's credit card, but I realized my decision to only pay in cash was wise and will be standard practice for me.**I have ordered tandoori fish, chapati, and goat curry so far. They were both very tasty. I really enjoy a good burn but was careful to order ""medium"" spice on the curry to figure out what they consider to be more mild in heat. I found the ""medium"" level to be spicy enough.The only thing that kind of threw me off was the first time I ordered tandoor fish, it did not come with anything else. There was a good enough serving-4 filets-so I had leftover for the next day. I am more of a bread person than rice, so I always order a side of roti or something. However, for those expecting a starch know head of time the tandoor dishes may not come with it. Each time my order was correct but it does take them much longer than other restaurants to prepare. I'm generally okay with that, as properly cooked Indian food should not be ready in amazing speed. However, the second time I went to pick up I had already given them 45 minutes and I think they still had not really fixed it because I ended up waiting another 15 or so inside. I think that part of this is getting used to running the restaurant with online orders, so I will be forgiving. Honestly, I don't really care if the food is worth it and for me it was."

2015-11-08,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Station,Update from last reviews - this has become a fav neighborhood gem. Today I stopped in and had the sloppy joe. What a diff fr the first time I reviewed this sandwich - it is fantastic with a wonderful southern twist of pimento cheese and chips in sandwich
2015-11-08,2.0,"Durham, NC",Jose and Sons,"Great date night spot.  The cocktails are impressive, and we really have our server to thank for her amazing suggestions.  We told her what we like, and her recommendations were spot on.  The hubs tried their take on an Old Fashioned, and I had the spicy pineapple margarita.  We couldn't stop talking about them the whole night!We almost always get queso when we go out to Mexican restaurants, so this was no exception.  However, our only choice was mac & cheese queso with kale and bacon.  Now we love all of those things, but it was a little unusual as a queso dish.  We tried dipping it wish the chips, which was weird.  It was good eating as a normal appetizer, but it was really rich and filled me up before my enchiladas suizas (with green sauce) arrived.  Hubs, however, was able to demolish his own enchiladas (with red sauce).Overall, we loved the ambiance and our dinners.  I expect us to return again soon!"
2015-11-08,5.0,"Washington, DC",The Morning Times,"This place serves pretty good coffee for very reasonable price. $1.25 will get you a small coffee! They also serves snacks, food (sandwiches, etc) that that're supposed to be pretty good. This place can seem very small & packed, however there're a lot more seatings upstairs."
2015-11-08,5.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Sullivan’s Steakhouse,"Disappointing.  First the steak may be great.  I cannot comment on that as we had Sea Bass, which was, good.  It was not steamed as the menu indicated but broiled and sat in an Asian sauce which was, common and could easily be found at Harris teeter.  The staff is nice and attentive however the management does us all a disservice by putting them in clingy black tops very short clingy short skirts and fishnet stockings.  A nice top and classy black skirt would set a much better tone consistent with the apparent desired image of the establishment. The restaurant is tight and loud with the voices of the customers and blaring music.  In this way it is as Chilies or TGI Fridays. There is very little which is ""White Tablecloth,"" here except the tablecloth and wood tone on the walls and bar.  In that tone, the general attire of the clientele is more beach vacation than anything.  Half of the people in the bar wore t shirts and shorts with many baseball hats.  The bar is loud as is the restaurant.  Give up the intent to have an intimate conversation in a classy restaurant.  This is Not Ruth Criss or Morton's in the least.  As well unfortunate was the sewage smell in the entry way, this after the urine smell in the elevator of the Glennwood parking garage. All this to say that for the most part Raleigh struggles with any sense of real sophistication in most cases and is more of a First Friday, Dancing in the Street Microbrew town excepting for the Umstead and An perhaps which are not actually in Raleigh.  Finally the cost for the sub par experience?  Without tip,  a Margherita,  2 shots of chilled Patrone and 1 red wine $54, 2 Sea Bass, 6 Oysters, 2 more shots and a side of asparagus $140.  I am 98% of the time more satisfied with cooking at home so ambiance and experience are important when venturing out. We gave it a try and likely will not try again."
2015-11-08,4.0,"Morrisville, NC",Jose and Sons,Food was good.  Ambience is casual and inviting.Good place to meet -- you can enjoy dinner and actually visit and hear each other.
2015-11-08,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Standard Foods,"Just had dinner here last night. My boyfriend and I tried to make a reservation but there were not any available for dinner time for weeks to come so we went right at 5:30pm when they opened for dinner and took a seat at the bar. However, there was still plenty of seating available for the duration of our stay so the reservation would not have been necessary anyways.There are no frills when it comes to the decor. Very clean, simple design which I enjoyed. Love that half of the place is a restaurant and the other half is a grocery store - very unique.We each ordered a cocktail. I was very impressed by the silver metal straw in mine! Shortly after, the manager came over to us and gave great advice on what to try on the menu. We ordered oysters, beef, and corn bread pudding for dinner and the caramel rum cake for dessert. Each dish was so carefully and beautiful crafted and delicious!Love this new gem! We will definitely be back!"

2015-11-09,5.0,"Mason City, IA",First Watch,"We needed a place for a Sunday breakfast/brunch option and First Watch filled the bill.  We were happy to discover the complimentary coffee bar offered to folks while they waited to be seated and that coupled with the comfy outdoor seating made our 20 minute wait fly by.  Once seated we were given ample time to check out the massive menu with the many healthy options as well as more traditional offerings.  Omelettes, scrambles, salads, soups and sandwiches round out the menu that offers something for just about anyone.  I tried one of their specialty juices and was a bit disappointed with the flavor but then remembered that it was a juice and not a more hearty smoothie drink with texture and body.  Next time I will remember that fact.Service was good and the decor fun and clean.  Nice place to check out any day of the week for a healthy option."
2015-11-09,5.0,"Cary, NC",Taqueria El Toro,"Best taqueria by far in the area.  I was hesitant to make the drive out because some of the newpaper reviews have been so off (example: Durham's taqueria scene is SO overrated), but I was nearby on Saturday.  My ""local"" is Racho Grande in Cary, with outstanding meats and fixing bar, and El Toro was every bit the equal.  Not only that, but unlike a lot of taquerias with limited turnover, El Toro has a huge kitchen and turns out your meal quickly.  Maybe not the best tortillas around (the old Pacho Villa's tortillas were probably the best), but solid.  I had 3 tacos: the cesina (which is not super easy to find), the lengua (good), and the chicharrron prensado which is surely one of the most evil and delicious fillings I've ever had.  I am going to be stopping in every time I'm down in that area - which unfortunately isn't nearly enough!"
2015-11-09,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sawasdee Thai Restaurant & Bar,"Originally, I was trying to order take-out Ramen from here, but when I called they informed me that they don't do take-out for their ramen. So I decided just to come in to eat it.I went here by myself last week and sat at the bar. They were pretty busy and the hostess was a little frazzled so I sat myself. She made time to come over, greet me, and send a waiter for my drink order. The waiter was quite and efficient, but probably a little new because he didn't seem to know what I was asking for when I ordered.Although I originally came for Ramen, I ended up getting the tom yum noodle soup. Oh man. It was so good. I almost cried (probably out of exhaustion) because it was just exactly what I wanted. The lemongrass flavor was so delicate and balanced with the spice in the chili pepper. I would eat this over and over again. I also really liked the noodles in it as it made it a very hearty and satisfying meal. The waitstaff promptly brought my check when I asked with the to-go Thai Tea (not the best one I've ever had), but decent."
2015-11-09,4.0,"Rolesville, NC",Casa San Carlo Italian Restaurant,"The meal was fabulous,  pasta was fresh, bread was hot and tasty. The only thing that I would add is that they tell you the price of the specials. Wonderful romantic evening for couples."
2015-11-09,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mo-Te Vietnamese Restaurant,"Looks like a Chinese take out place. The cook is very nice and the server is very accommodating. Apparently this resto has been here for 15yrs and the current Chef and owner 10yrs. I tried ordering their Hot and spicy beef soup but they ran out. Apparently because of the recent weekend it sold out. I wanted Pho because it's the best to eat in a rainy Monday. They are closed on Tuesdays FYI. They have the usual condiments available for Pho Hot sauce, Hoisin and Shiracha. They don't have a choice of sizes like S M or Large. They seem to have Vietnam Sandwhiches and some rice meals and spring rolls I'd have to comeback to taste. The Pho is pretty decent and tasty. I ordered the Combination Pho it has pretty decent amount of meat but only 1 quarter meat ball and tripe. I'd prefer equal amounts since it was a ""Combination"". The noodles were a good amount and the meat is soft as it is tasty. Came in for lunch and was the only one. It was a good wait for the soup to be served so I can only imagine the wait if it's packed. The Flan was of no note so don't order. Otherwise if you want decent Pho and don't mind a simple resto try this place."

2015-11-09,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mami Nora’s,"You cannot beat this place for the quality of food and the affordable prices!! The rotisserie chicken is so flavorful and juicy - it is delicous.  Totally my go to if I don't have time to bring food to work since it's a relatively healthy option if you choose the salad and chicken soup as your sides (which I tend to do) instead of the fried yucca or plaintains.  The cilantro vinaigrette dressing is heavenly for the salad, and their homemade green and yellow sauces are tasty.  It's a casual place where dishes range from $7-10/plate - it's a lot of food for the price so totally worth the short wait at busy times."
2015-11-09,5.0,"Durham, NC",Stanbury,"Great service, accurate recommendations, amazing food, interesting ambiance -- what's not to love? Because we didn't have a reservation, my friend and I were seated at the bar, where we shared small plates of fresh oysters, Roasted Marrow, NC Tuna Crudo (seasonal), and Crispy Pig Head. All of the dishes were incredibly rich and flavorful, salty but not overly so. Trying the roasted marrow was an experience--the marrow is used like a butter spread on whole grain toast then topped w cooked argula, onions, and capers. My favorite dish was by far the crispy pig head, which had a crispy, breaded outer layer with mustard cream and pork inside. Get a reservation ahead of time, and if you have a long wait to be seated, make sure to visit Escazu, the artisan chocolate shop next door."
2015-11-09,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Big Ed’s North,"After church on Sunday we chose to try Big Ed's - provided a line wasn't out the door when we got there.  It wasn't!  In fact there was a large group waiting to be seated in the entrance when we arrived, but we were a party of two and quickly seated.Found out after we had been seated and handed menus that on Sunday they only offer the breakfast menus,  That's fine as many places have a Sunday brunch, however I went there for a good country lunch - not a breakfast for lunch.  It would have been very helpful if there was signage on the door advising folks of the ""Breakfast only"" Sunday menu.Having said that, I ordered the Cajun chicken with eggs sunny side up and hash browns. All cooked well, ample serving size, good taste - but my ""Cajun"": chicken could have used a little more spice.Service was a bit slow.  Yes they were busy, but our server let both myself and my guest run out of beverages - twice.It was a good Big Ed's breakfast.  Just not what I wanted for Sunday lunch."

The  read that comes with the meal is absolutely devine, the dishes are flavorful and their daily specials are always unique and feature several local farms or products. I use Open Table to do easy reservations online and it's a great go to place when I have tickets for the comedy club next door. I park I  the parking lot next door in front of City Limit Saloon and have never had a problem there. I've been there for a large party of 10 and smaller tables and they accommodated both easily. Live instrumental music plays in the background and it's no surprise to see random people dancing by the very small stage. I have seen it super busy on weekends so I'd recommend earlier dinner times or reservations if you don't want to eat long. Highly recommend :)"

2015-11-09,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Rye Bar & Southern Kitchen,"We had an early dinner on a Friday evening before catching a show at the Duke Energy Center. First impressions: very clean, modern minimalist, yet warm feel when you walk in. The hostess was attentive and gave an option to sit in the main dining area or the bar. When I chose the bar, she let me know there could be a wait on receiving drinks since they were awaiting one bar tender to arrive. Since I wasn't pressed for time I said ok. It didn't cause an issue whatsoever. Drinks were strong, classic, delicious. Food came out promptly, hot, and presently nicely. Yes my side order was wrong (ordered salad and got fries; oops, ate them anyway). I do think this place presents itself to be fancier than it really is; which I actually liked. It feels like a nice date place and serves up the cocktails I enjoy without being snobby. I'll be back!"

You can choose from an array of burgers or make your own, from basic to fancy. There is a choice of meats, bun, salad, drinks, sides, you name it.All of these is nice but really it does not matter... The beef patty does the talking: get it medium rare, it is tender, juicy and it has an incredible beefy flavor. The french or sweet potato fries are delicious and I can't get enough of the bad daddy's sauce.The service is usually impeccable and the patio very enjoyable when the weather allows."
2015-11-09,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Beasley’s Chicken & Honey,"It is really nice and relaxed there. I love the chicken biscuit. It comes with house made mustard, pickled tomato and honey. It is delicious, big enough to fill you up and it's aggressively priced! The chicken and waffle are excellent too, so is their mashed potatoes side. I would personally choose Beasley's over Dame's in Durham but it is just my opinion.One more thing, the place is popular so beware of the lines."
2015-11-09,5.0,"Washington, DC",Bida Manda,"I came here for a friend's birthday party on a Saturday night and was really impressed. The atmosphere is gorgeous (who is their interior decorator?!) and the food is sublime. Out of our large group of about 10, almost half the people ordered the Crispy Pork Belly Soup -- the dish came with quite a reputation. I didn't order it since I'm not a fan of coconut broth, but found it really tasty. It has a rich, creamy flavor, probably from both coconut and pork belly. It's also a bit spicy and laden with cilantro floating blissfully through the noodles -- I've been told these are two ""good"" attributes in food... I thought about getting the Pad Thai (my usual go-to dish) but opted for the Saffron Crepe because it sounded interesting. I'm glad I took the risk because it was amazing! I got the version with Sauteed Shrimp and Bacon so it really couldn't go that wrong. It was like a savory pancake/omelette folded in half, with the shrimp and bacon ""stuffed"" inside. It came with some sweet/vinegary sauce (with the consistency of water) -- I poured it little by little on the crepe as I ate it, to avoid the sogginess I'd read about in other reviews. Everyone who tried it at the table seemed equally impressed. I would definitely go back just for that dish alone.The dishes here seem to be a bit uneven. I heard the Pad Thai is pretty ordinary. We also ordered the Fresh Summer Rolls as an appetizer and found them to be just okay. But all in all, Bida Manda is a very solid addition to the Raleigh dining scene."
2015-11-09,4.0,"Annapolis, MD",Sitti,"Bottom Line:  Flavorful Lebanese cuisine served in a hip atmosphere in downtown Raleigh.Admittedly, before going to Sitti I had never tried Lebanese food but I do really enjoy other Mediterranean cuisines so I figured it would be delicious.  If you aren't sure what Lebanese cuisine entails, think about pita bread, hummus, goat cheese, chicken kabobs, marinated lamb and assorted fruits and vegetables like tomatoes, eggplants, olives and lemons.  If you are still on the fence then you can order a sampler platter (called ""Lebanese Tasting"") before committing yourself to Lebanese but I'm pretty sure you're going to like it!  Another cool thing about Sitti is that they have some nice vegetarian options.  In any event, don't leave Sitti without trying the cheese rolls.  Service here was very good and the décor is definitely hip.  They have a nice outdoor patio as well that can be reserved for private events.  The one thing to note is that it can be very loud in here at peak times."
2015-11-09,4.0,"Chesterfield, VA",Beasley’s Chicken & Honey,"In Raleigh last weekend for a little Clemson Football! After celebrating our win (sorry Wolfpack) we made our way to brunch at Beasley's Chicken & Honey on Sunday morning around 11:45 am.  We knew this place must be good, because there was a line around the block.  We waited outside nearly an hour to be seated, and finally, our party was called! The inside of the space is obviously super Southern and super cute.  Exposed brick and some industrial metal tables and chairs had a great vibe.  Two minor complaints, the chairs were stools, so not super comfortable for a long brunch.  Also, the menu is only written on a chalk board wall in the back of the restaurant that was obscured by the duct work from where we were sitting.  Minor inconvenience but we just used our phones to read the menu.I ordered the chicken and waffles ($13) and the pimento mac and cheese custard ($3.50).  $16.50 is a bit steep for breakfast, but it was all very good and the portions were substantial.  The sweet honey on the crispy and lightly fried chicken was divine.  It was not greasy one bit and was probably the best fried chicken I've ever had. The waffle was pretty basic.  Nothing extraordinary, but it's hard to go wrong with a waffle! Another minor disappointment was that they do not have pitchers of mimosas, which I feel should be a brunch essential.Our waitress was friendly and efficient, but we did wait a while for our food (close to another hour). Don't come here for brunch if you're in any hurry or already hungry what-so-ever.  Was it worth the wait? Probably not.  But we were there with good friends and the time didn't pass but so slowly. I would certainly return again for just the chicken, but only if it was less crowded. Synopsis: AMAZING CHICKEN. LONG WAIT."

The shredded beef is my favorite filling along with the plantains.  Yum.This place looks and feels like a chain store, but creates food with magnificent flavor and provides options for everyone to enjoy.  Just be careful because this place gets really busy during lunch hours, although the line does moves quickly."
2015-11-10,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tazza Kitchen Cameron Village,"I FINALLY got to try the Spicy Sausage and Black Pepper Honey pizza that everyone has been raving about! If other restaurants are smart, they'll start having honey as a toppings option also. The contrast between the spicy sausage and the black pepper with the sweet honey worked amazingly. Another thing that I really like about Tazza's pizzas is that they have very thin crusts. It makes the pizza not too filling and I don't feel like I'm in a food coma when I finish, unlike my experiences at most pizza places. I wouldn't recommend these pizzas for sharing, unless you are ordering some other items, because of this reason (And also because it is just too good to share). But another thing with them having such a thin crust, is that the weight of the toppings and cheese overpower it a bit, so the crust went somewhat limp. But it really does taste amazing.Now that I've done my part raving about the pizza, back to the rest of the meal. I'm a sucker for goat cheese and I knew I wanted to order it after seeing the many pictures of it on yelp. It came out super hot, but I couldn't wait for it to cool off. Even when it was burning my tongue, the richness of the cheese was delicious. The bread that came with it for dipping was good too. It was a sturdy bread that could hold its own with the cheese.We went on a Wednesday night and the restaurant was pretty busy, but the service was good The restaurant was very clean and I love the décor. There is something about it that is simple, yet trendy. Overall, it was a great experience and definitely want to come back and try their brunch."

The first time we ate here it was our 1st wedding anniversary and we could not have been happier. Great atmosphere, beautiful decor, and most importantly delicious food.

I recommend the Pesto Gnocchi and the Campfire dessert!"

Oh yeah try their pastries too...heaven."
2015-11-10,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Pho Vietnam,"I am not very experienced with Vietnamese cuisine but I can say that the Vermicelli BBQ pork was delicious! The pork was seasoned and cooked to perfection. The whole dish went together well and I like how you can sauce it to your liking. I have high hopes for this Vietnamese restaurant. The service was excellent! It is a casual atmosphere but you are seated and waited upon. Even though we strolled in half an hour before closing we had no pressure to order or eat quickly. The staff was very friendly and attentive. A bill ticket is given during your meal and you go to the register to pay when you are finished. I also tried the Beef Lemon Grass Bahn Mi and though it was not to my liking, I have no past experience to compare it to. I think they made it correctly, it was just not what I thought it would be. The meat was sweet but a different sweetness than what I am used to. It is hard to pick from their menu. The food not only sounds amazing but the pictures will only make you want them all!"
2015-11-10,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Ole Time Barbecue,"Ole Time Barbecue has the charm of a roadside diner. The employees are all very polite, and I would absolutely love to fall in love with a place like this. Unfortunately, I couldn't.I appreciate the heck out of their hushpuppy baskets that come with every meal. Barbecue and hushpuppies are a natural pairing, and some barbecue places somehow go without this treasure. Hushpuppies do not count as one of your sides.I once ordered a chicken and pork combination plate. Due to cook times that can span many hours, barbecue restaurants don't cook most of their meat to order. It's natural for a restaurant to precook their meats and to keep them in a steamer, but what happens when a chicken breast stays in the steamer for too long? The bones become incredibly brittle. Do you see how this can be a problem when they serve the chicken on top of the pork? Ole Time Barbecue now serves the meats on different plates, but all I can remember is finding all of the bone shards in my pork. Yes, this is partially my fault for not asking for a separate plate, so I admit that I may be just as stupid as Ole Time.Ole Time Barbecue's sides are simply upsetting. To claim that they give half the effort of other barbecue restaurants would imply that they give any effort at all. The green beans seem to go straight from the can to your plate. The mac n cheese is Velveeta crap, not the delicious baked mac n cheese that you find at many other barbecue restaurants. There are way too many good barbecue places for me to want to return to Ole Time Barbecue."
2015-11-10,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Despina’s Cafe,"Stopped in unexpectedly today, ordered the chicken salad wrap and it came with a bag of chips. The lunch itself was pretty basic, but good. My friend ordered a chicken, roasted pepper panini and I think that was the better option. My latte was good, but again, basic. Not quite the level of expertise of some of the local coffee shops in town. I will say it came with a mint truffle that was amazing. On that note, I believe the thing you come in here for is dessert. I didn't get any sweets so I will come back as they looked fantastic, home made. Service was great, very friendly, which for me goes far."
2015-11-10,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",18 Seaboard,"18 Seaboard makes it really hard to find them behind the back side of a street but when you do, you know the hard work will pay off.  This cozy, romantic restaurant delivers on a quality dining experience that is unique in the area.  That's my opinion but I'm usually right about these things.After being seated by a warm and friendly hostess, our waiter Dale appeared immediately and started his rock star service.  First highlight of the evening...the chef sends out a comp bite of something. That evening we had a spoon of mushroom cream with bacon on top.  You had me at bacon and boy was it amazing!For my entree I had the BBQ brisket with sweet potato butter and Old Mill of Guilford cheese grits. Do I need to say any more??  Wildly good.  I paired that with an Australian Malbec, Alta Vista.  Oh, yeah, Dale can suggest wine pairings for you.  Seriously full service table side.The evening could not be complete without dessert.  I choose the Sticky Toffee Pudding - a carmalized apples and whisky situation topped with homemade whip.  To. Die. For. The best dessert I've had since moving to Raleigh. This place isn't cheap.  This kind of quality never is. Run, don't walk to check it out."

2015-11-10,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Firebirds Wood Fired Grill,"My first (or second?) 5 star review! We did drinks and half priced happy hour apps at the bar before dinner. The dirty bird martini was perfect!  We all loved our drinks. The Sam Adams beer cheese with the soft pretzels was awesome! Only complaint would be the happy hour drink specials were confusing, seemed like they are everyday but they are only on Wednesday. May have just been wishful thinking on our end. We were a party of 5 and all ordered steak. Everyone loved there dishes. I had the filet with blue cheese sauce and port mushrooms and it is the best steak I have ever had in my life. Full disclosure, I was a pescatarian for nearly 20 years, but it was awesome! They brought me a beautifully decorated dessert (I ordered the creme brulee cheesecake which was terrific and enough for everyone to have a couple of bites) with happy birthday written on the plate and it topped of the meal perfectly. Great service as well. Thanks for a great birthday dinner!"

It wasn't a busy night at all.Appetizer took 30 mins to come out and we only ordered the chicken quesadilla. Entree too even longer, Pepsi taste like water. I'm so glad I purchased a groupon to cover some of the cost of this meal. Finally asked for the check and she took extremely long to bring back my card. All they way around I give TWO THUMBS DOWN."

The bulgogi (marinated beef) is super good, kimchi jigae is my favorite soup, and kalbi (is a bit more pricy than bulgogi but tastier). The service Is fantastic. The waiter is Caucasian and knows Korean. The service there is clean and welcoming. My husband and i go to this restruant everytime we go to Raleigh. Go to the restruant and find out what im talking about and if you're like me who goes on yelp to try new things. This is the place to go!"

When I walked in and sat at the bar, ready to order my beverage in preparation for toasting at the universal 1700 time, I got nothing but attitude from a bartender named Kate.   I interrupted her servicing of her regulars and she gave my wife and I nothing but static.  I will say that her boss Shannon, did come by and greet us appropriately, as the daughter of a Marine would.  Kate's a drag... Shannon made it right!"

I started with the bay scallop appetizer, it was different than what I expected but really impressed me.   It is served in a small bowl with a broth like you would find with mussel's.  Fantastic flavors.I came for the red sauce but I wound up going for the bolognese and I was not disappointed!!!  Great flavors and there is a dollop of ricotta (mixed with herbs) on top that really pulls the flavors out of the dish. I will be back that is for sure."
2015-11-10,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Godavari Indian Restaurant,"Decent buffet, despite the Styrofoam bowls.  Spice level is nice, and the flavors are spot-on.  Only problems: naan that is like a cracker, food is quite greasy, and the food quality isn't very high.  Seems like lots of frozen vegetables are used - we all know what frozen carrots, peas and beans look like!  And I had to spit out the Okra- it was too fibrous.Despite the lack of attention to finishing details, it's a decent restaurant."
2015-11-10,5.0,"San Diego, CA",Kamado Grille,"Very unique dining experience! Open dining area seemingly bringing the outdoors inside. There's live trees, water, stone, and natural wood throughout the restaurant. On your way into the building, out front, there's a bocce court, cornhole games, and a ping pong table. All the tables have iPads you can order from throughout your meal and there's no surprises with your check since you are seeing the total right there on your table. Very prompt and friendly service. If ordering from the waiter is more your thing, you can do that too. Food is excellent and drink! Many choices. I'm a craft beer drinker and was really happy with the amount and selection. I believe there were 40 taps. We got a tour of the kitchen after our meal which was lots of fun and informative. Felt like VIPs. Fun for the whole family or a fun date night (as me and the mister had)."

Just a tip, Bad Daddy's slightly under cooks their burgers, so if you want a medium temp then order a medium well. Our server told me this bit of info and he was spot on. The medium well temp was a true medium with a bit of pink in the middle. I'm glad he told me this info because their ""medium"" would've been too rare for me.  Their sweet potato fries are also very delicious and they are served with honey mustard that had are bit of a kick."

The bread is hot and warm that matches well with the olive oil they serve to dip it in. You have to get an order of falafel balls too they are perfectly seasoned as well. I don't typically get excited about falafel balls but I did this time.
2015-11-11,1.0,"Stephens City, VA",Lee’s Kitchen,"I have had 3 meals here. The first meal was jerk chicken because that's what you base the authenticity of Jamaican food right?! I got the lunch special which cost me around $8.00. The generous portion size was abundant with tender chunks of dark and light bone in chicken deliciousness. I had them put extra jerk sauce on it which was a mistake, as it is the real deal scotch bonnet burn your ass hot. I had it with peas and rice which were standard and a side of collards. Collards were too vinegary. Second meal were oxtails which consisted of 70% bone, 20% fat and 10% marrow meat . This is not my first rodeo with oxtails, if braised right the meat should just be easily sucked of the bone. I don't think they use quality oxtails. Again peas and rice were standard. I spent about $13 for the oxtails. Third meal was lunch size brown chicken stew. I guess I was expecting a Trinidad or Guyanese style spicy brown stew. Lee's kitchen brown stew is sweeter, rather than spicy. They are very generous with serving size.  The bone is left on chicken and very tender. Had it on plain ole white rice and a side of very salty mixed veggies."

There was flies around our table, food from previous customers still on and around the tAble/chairs/floor.The Naan was cold and insufficient for the amount of food we ordered.

2015-11-11,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Flying Biscuit Café,"Conveniently located in Cameron Village on the same strip as Goodberry's. I went in alone on a weekday morning around 10am and was seated at a high top by the bar. It took a couple minutes for someone to come over to ask about a drink order - I think the bartender covers the bar seats and three high tops along the wall. (Seems like a lot for her to cover.) Food came out quickly (within 5 minutes, I think, and it was fairly busy too). Order was wrong but quickly fixed. I got the Clifton omelet and liked that I could sub tofu for free or egg whites for $0.60 (I substituted egg whites). I didn't order any but I like that they have soysauge on the menu. The ""tomato coulis"" on the omelet is pretty much marinara sauce. The ""moon-dusted"" potatoes are home fries with a strong rosemary flavor. (Not sure what they think the moon-dust is.) The goat cheese is okay - seems more like a slathering of lower quality sour cream consistency goat cheese. For the price (about $12 including tax and tip) and quick service I'd come back to try other things too. Just a note - I originally came here for fresh orange juice but they do not have it, if you're craving that. They have OJ - it's just not fresh. They also have wifi but the signal's weak."

2015-11-11,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sawasdee Thai Restaurant & Bar,"They have good thai food for sure, but in comparison they definitely skimp on the portions. In recent months I discovered their ramen! The soup base of the tonkatsu is totally on point - full flavored and bold, definitely what ramen noodle soup should be for tonkatsu. My only complaint again is that it's a small bowl, with very little veggies and only one thin slice of pork that comes with it. You can add meat and veggies and things like that for an extra $1 or $2 so it adds up in price to be similar to the more expensive bowls of ramen at places like Sono or Buku. Their standard bowl starts right around $10. Another deduction is that their wait staff makes you do just that....wait. they are rarely a full house when I've gone and maybe only have 3 or 4 tables but man, they are super slow. I've been to better Thai places for sure so this isn't my f irst choice but at least their tasty food keeps me coming randomly."
2015-11-11,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Shaba Shabu,Now one of my favorite places to eat. The owners and employees go above a beyond every time we visit. I love the vegan options and they even make special dishes just for us when we request them (we asked about brown rice and they added it to the menu). The cocktails are some of the best in town and the atmosphere is so refreshing. We go at least once a week. I'm so glad Shaba Shabu is here in Raleigh. I am a fan.
2015-11-11,5.0,"Knightdale, NC",Ni Asian Kitchen,"There is only one other place we know of in Raleigh that serves authentic Malaysian dishes, but in my opinion, Ni beats them hands down! Our favorites dishes so far are the Sambal and the Rendang. The first time we ordered the Sambal, it was a bit dry and lacking the kick we are used to. The next time we asked for extra Sambal sauce, and it was perfect! Sambal sauce is quite strong in general, so we think they may go easy on it to appease the American palate. The Rendang was perfect the first time we ordered it. Spicy, creamy, coconutty. I also appreciate the portions on the plate. The ratio of meat/rice/sauce is perfect, where other places may give too much rice or drown the whole dish in sauce. Another dish we really like (although not Malaysian) is the Pad See Ew. This is a good choice if you are not into spicy dishes. If you like Drunken Noodles, you should like this dish as well. All in all, we were very pleased, and can't wait to go back and try their other dishes!"
2015-11-11,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Winston’s Grille,"Meh.  i had heard a lot of good things about this place so maybe that is why I was disappointed.   It wasn't bad, but it wasn't a good experience.  My Husband and I wanted to go some where nice to have our 2nd wedding anniversary kid free dinner in October.  It was a sunday night, and a little later in the night,  so we thought they wouldn't be too busy. But they were very busy. Our waiter would go away for long periods, I think because they were so busy and it seems the other tables he was in charge of were in another section of the restaurant so it was hard to get him if we needed something. They had a cat fish spacial, Parmesan crusted, that was supposed to come with collard greens and grits.  However, when my fish came out a) the fish was pink inside/not fully cooked and b) the food runner informed me that they were out of collard greens so they decided to pick a second side for me with out asking. They were green beans, and ok but not what I was expecting.  And i just did not understand why when they found out they were out of the side I ordered why they wouldn't have told me and ask the customer what side they would prefer instead.   The waiter came back by to see how our food was, and I let him know that my fish was pink and not cooked, he was nice and took it back to the kitchen.  My husband ate his food and by the time he was done then my 2nd fish came out.  This one was cooked, but by the time I got it it wasn't appetizing because it was all cut up and mushy, i guess where they were making sure it was actually cooked.  I guess a person who was the manager came over to see how the fish was this time and if i was enjoying it. I let him know, it was ok and cooked, but was disappointed that they were out of collard greens.  He exclaimed that he didn't know they were out of collard greens and was surprised to hear that, then he offered me a free desert. After my fish having to go back and having to wait forever for it and not getting the side i had asked for I was excepting more like a percentage off of our bill but the free desert was a nice gesture.  The atmosphere and was nice and the grits were really the best part of the whole night."
2015-11-11,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Remedy Diner,"I wanted to like this place. I really really did. But I was sorely disappointed. So here's the rundown....I don't eat much meat so the vegetarian and vegan options on the menu were intriguing and I couldn't wait to try it out. Dined there on a weekday afternoon with BF.  The decor and vibe inside are cool and a little funky and I liked the low lighting. However, we chose to dine outside on the back patio because it was a nice day.  Service was prompt. Not overly friendly but it was 4 o'clock on a weekday  and I think the bartender was the one coming out to take our order so it was totally fine. We ordered two margaritas on the rocks. The drinks we were served were definitely NOT margaritas. It looked and tasted like a mix of orange juice, grapefruit juice, and tequila. Strong, but lacking ""margarita"" flavor.  BF drank his but I didn't finish mine. We both chose vegetarian entrées. I ordered a black bean burger with fries and BF ordered  a salad that came with mixed greens, blue cheese crumbles, avocado, and ""tuna"" salad on top. But he chose to get the ""tuna"" salad on the side.  (Tuna is in parentheses because it's mock tuna salad, using some kind of grain instead of the fish so it's vegetarian) Black bean burger had hard crispy edges all around. Like, hard enough to bang on the plate AND it sounds like you're eating potato chips when you crunch it. Not cool.  I removed the whole outside and just ate the center of the patty doused with ketchup. It had ok flavor, but not great. Salad greens weren't very fresh or crisp, blue cheese  crumbles were tiny and sparse, and avocado was already brown and oxidized like it had been sliced and sat somewhere for quite some time before finally making it onto the salad.  The salad was served with a piece of baguette that was as hard and dry as the edges of my black bean burger.  The flavor of the tuna salad was strange. Not sure if they were actually trying to re-create the taste of tuna but it was a definite miss. I kept tasting it over and over hoping it would grow on me but unfortunately it did not. The entire meal fell flat.  I gave the place three-stars simply because they have plentiful vegetarian and vegan  options but I can't say that I would ever return. The menu looks great but the recipes need some tweaking and definitely some QA before the food goes out."

2015-11-11,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Seoul Garden Restaurant,"Well I figured it's time for an updated review given that Seoul Garden has changed owners and I've kind of developed a higher palette for Korean BBQ after having instant access to it in Korea this past summer... and I must say, I'm still a fan of Seoul Garden! Thank goodness!I was a bit nervous when my family and I arrived to Seoul Garden and we didn't recognize any of the people up front (owners or managers). We've been coming here for awhile and learning about new owners can be a bit nerve racking... We were a bit scared if the changes in management would trickle down to the menu and in turn, the food and its quality but thankfully that wasn't the case! During our latest trip to Seoul Garden, we mainly ordered meats for the grill tables: galbi, bulgogi, spicy pork bulgogi and samgyeupsal--all still very delicious! The portions, flavors, and quality were the same. I'm always craving the thinly sliced yet flavorful and tender galbi and very happy it's still as mouthwatering as it was before. In comparison to my experiences in Korea, I'd say the flavor depth is similar (better in Korea) and unfortunately the prices are much steeper here but given the competition in the area, Seoul Garden is a clear cut winner when it comes to Korean BBQ. I somehow have not managed to try their jajamyeoung though... must remember that next time. Also, on this past visit the ban-chan (side dishes) were plentiful and our server even brought out more without hesitation compared to in the past when we've had to flag someone down and ask for it. So, it seems like the customer service here is on the rise. The new owner and manager came by to make sure everything was good as well and really seemed to care about our dining experience.The prices are similar, if not the same as before --still pricey but worth it. I'm just glad that I can expect the same quality of food despite the change in ownership. So I'm back to dreaming about Seoul Garden till the next time I dine here and recommending it to others looking for good Korean food in the Triangle."
2015-11-11,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Lilly’s Pizza,"As long as you don't mind waiting and smelling like a pizza joint when you leave then Lilly's is pretty darn tasty. I've been a fan for many many years, gosh if I could only remember my first visit to Lilly's, that's how long I've been coming here:)I love their pizza and all the choices you have to choose from. They make some unique pies and tasty apps, salads, and wings as well.  The pretzels are awesome as well as their pita with hummus and artichoke dip. Ohh I'm getting hungry just writing this review. They also serve a lot of good beer and you can get a pitcher. If you are looking for vegan or veggie options you are in luck, because Lilly's serves both.If the weather is nice and you can grab a seat outside then do it, or your eyes are going to burn and you'll never be able to get the smell of smoke out of your hair (from the pizza ovens). I've gotta say the service can be awfully spotty here so know that going in. Order up front and they will call out your name and deliver your food to you. The patio is dog friendly and great for people watching. Looking for local pizza then Lilly's is an awesome place to check out, no it's not NY pizza but it's got it's own unique flavor and quirky pies to choose from.My latest visit I ordered the Sir Walter it was pretty salty with all the prosciutto di parma so not sure I'd order it again but I loved the mushrooms and smoked gouda. The wings are huge and pretty tasty as well but I think my favorite part is their homemade blue cheese dressing."
2015-11-11,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Flying Biscuit Café,"The biscuit is so good it deserves to name the restaurant. Long wait on a Sunday morning (of course) but the food was yummy. The apple butter that accompanies the biscuit is delicious and not too sweet. The coffee was not great, weak flavorless brown food service swill. I had the Piedmont omelet and it was full of goodness. I was skeptical about the chicken sausage but really liked it. It's flavorful and meaty. The moon dusted potatoes are home fries with rosemary. My portion was sparse and limp, and looked like it had been sitting under the salamander for a loooong time.The service was outstanding, and we didn't have to wait very long for our food after we ordered. Our table sat and talked a while after the meal and we didn't feel at all rushed by the staff.Overall, I was very pleased with the experience, the meal, and the service. Wish they'd invest in quality coffee though."
2015-11-11,5.0,"Amityville, NY",Big Ed’s City Market Restaurant,I'm from the north and I truly enjoyed the southern hospitality. The breakfast was excellent and the service was phenomenal. I don't usually eat too much bread but I couldn't get enough of those biscuits. I wish I remembered my waitress name because I would give her a huge shoutout.
2015-11-11,5.0,"Wake Forest, NC",Sassool,"Went for the first time today and didn't know how everything went and what was good there. I think it was the manager/owner who took my order, but it was my first time there so he guided me through it all! He was a very nice and patient man. He basically made my ""make-it-your-own"" platter for me  but everything on it was really good!If you want to try something new and light, I recommend this place."
2015-11-11,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",David’s Dumpling & Noodle Bar,"Davids is an oasis of fine food. Their soups are amazing, seafood soup is my favorite.  The Malaysian curry soup is great too. We love the vegetarian  dumplings with edamame in them. Very consistent and very good. There aren't many restaurants with the owner on the premises and it does make a difference."
2015-11-11,5.0,"Holly Springs, NC",The Fiction Kitchen,Red pepper soup good I like my soup hotter mushroom app not to good charge $1. For a tiny ramekin of sauce soup no crackers with soup asked for bread three pieces of burned over toasted bread and charged $2. So be careful and ask about charges would I return no
2015-11-11,5.0,"Durham, NC",Gonza Tacos Y Tequila,"I went to dinner last night for a friend's birthday celebration at the new Gonza location and we were all very impressed! Before going to dinner I called the restaurant to ask about parking and they let me know that there is a public lot on Maiden St. Very helpful!Once we arrived they did make us wait until most of our party of 12 was there to be seated, but the host kept checking on us to make sure we were okay.Our drink orders and chips for the table with bowls of queso, guacamole and really good, chunky style style salsa (not typical restaurant style, seriously, this stuff was good!) came out really quickly followed by all of our food orders (and they got every order right, which can be difficult for larger parties). Everything was tasty and the service was great!"
2015-11-11,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Aladdin’s Eatery,"I got the rolled pita with spicy chicken and it was good! Unfortunately, there's nothing that puts this place over the top from other Mediterranean spots for me other than the location. It's good food, good service and convenient location for those in brier creek. Wednesday night service could be a little better."
2015-11-11,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Taverna Agora,"Tried this place for the first time during a group dinner. It off all 12 of us, no one left disappointed. My friend, and I, had the Moussaka which she remarked was very authentic tasting (she spent a few years living in Greece). A couple with us had the stuffed pork chop,  which was a perfect entree for sharing, and another Roman in the group tried the Braised Lamb Shanks,  which looked like it was to die for.The staff was super friendly and very polite. I certainly feel like I'll have to come back to try more. Heads up: this place is very popular, even on a Tuesday night. Therefore, I would advise making reservations in advance."
2015-11-11,5.0,"Chicago, IL",Clouds Brewing,LOVED IT!!!!OK so I have never started out a review with all caps before so that must mean something. This place is a man paradise of beer and high quality bar food with ample TV's showing ESPN and everything else you could be interested in. I did the Downpour wall thing where you give them your credit card and they give you a wrist band that you use on a wall of taps of their own house brews. You pick any style of glass you want from pint to pilsner and then pour the amount of beer you want. Great way to taste the various types and see what you like. I loved the pale ale they had on tap. Super smooth and drinkable. Also had an order of generous jumbo chicken wings that were very reasonably priced and very well done with no breading as they should be. I travel to Raleigh a few times per year and will make this a regular stop from now on. Need to go back and try more menu items and more beer.
2015-11-11,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Jose and Sons,"Jose and Sons offers a wonderful atmosphere, and it's a shame that the service can't live up to it. I've been there a few times in the past several months, and each time the service gets worse and worse. Last night, my party waited 25 minutes for our server to bring boxes and checks after we requested them. Service was also so slow that we only had time for 1 drink each. They lost money in that regard - we each would've ordered at least 2 otherwise. The food is always good, but just slightly overly priced for what it is. Bottom line: If they would improve their service, it'd be a place well worth visiting. If not, I'd say there's plenty of other restaurants in this city offering upscale Mexican cuisine."
2015-11-11,3.0,"Clayton, NC",Sitti,"The four and five star reviews on here baffle me. Especially since there is such great middle eastern food in the Raleigh area to pick from - so much better than this place. This restaurant came highly recommended but we were incredibly disappointed. Every single thing we had was underseasoned, in fact, some of it seemed that it had no seasoning at all! So bland. The falafel appetizer was extremely crunch and difficult to even get a knife through, bland on the inside. All I tasted was a bit of cumin. Lamb and beef shwarma was not like any shwarma I had before. Usually it's sliced off a roast in thin pieces. This shwarma was in little chunks, like the size you'd get in a Chinese stir fry of beef and broccoli. Super underseasoned, bland. My husband had a chicken kabob sandwich which he said was very bland and boring as well. No seasoning. Even my son's kids meal of chicken and fries were underseasoned. The fries desperately needed some salt. The tahini sauce that came with everything literally tasted like tahini thinned out with water. Hardly any flavor at all. My Sitti salad was nothing more than some old lettuce on a plate with tomatoes that tasted like they had been in the fridge for 2 weeks, some cucumber and the most bland dressing I've ever tasted. Again, no seasoning at all. I think this place stays busy and benefits from being in a good location, but I can't understand why it gets the high reviews. Jasmin bistro, which is a chain, is so much better, as is Alexander's in Garner. Even Greek Fiesta is a lot better. Also, our waitress accidentally spilled water on me, didn't even apologize, and simply handed me a few extra napkins. I would never go back."
2015-11-11,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Joule Coffee,"Dined here with BF this morning. Greeted at the door by a friendly hostess and we sat in the window seats; great for people-watching. It was freezing because the air was blowing directly on us and the hostess turned it down at our request. Very nice of her! The inside of the restaurant was welcoming with low light and a long bar. Menu is on a chalkboard on the wall and there is a small pastry case with muffins, a couple of savory pastries, and cookies. We ordered two hot chai teas, a peppered chicken sandwich with a Caesar salad (instead of fries), and a bowl of tomato bisque. The food came out quickly and the service at this point was good. The chai tea was the perfect combo of sweet and spicy with a thick layer of foam on top, DELICIOUS! The peppered chicken sandwich was artfully created and it's obvious a lot of thought was put into the intricate combinations of flavor. Here's the rundown on the sandwichBread- thin and crusty so it will hold up to the moisture in the sandwichAvocado Puree -very thick layer, great for avocado loversBacon- thick cut and crisp Chicken- peppery, moist, tangy, Tomatoes- juicy, rich flavorThe tomato soup was tangy with big and small chunks of stewed tomato that melt in your mouth. I loved it but BF sad it was too tangy. I think the drizzle of oil on top added a little zing to it so a word of advice; if you don't like it tangy, maybe ditch the drizzle. I would order it again the exact same way though. YUM! The Caesar salad was AWESOME! Often Caesar salads are the most mundane side dish but this was great! It was served cold, the romaine was extra fresh and crisp, it was perfectly dressed and not drowning or lacking in dressing, and the piece de resistance to this delicious salad was the hint of citrus. I have no idea what it was or how they incorporated it into the dish but this took it from good to.....WOW!  After all this oohing and aahing over the food, unfortunately I must segue into the negative part of this review. After we finished eating, we waited for the check for a loooooong looooong looong time. Like, so long we were actually looking for the server. In her defense, I think she may have been the only server in the entire place because shes the only one I saw and when we found her she was across the restaurant. When we finally received the check, I asked the server to heat my nearly-full cup of tea and put it in a to-go cup so I could take it with me. She told me they have no way to heat it up so she offered to ""pour some hot water in it to make it hot again"". Ummmmmm.......no. There's no teapot, micro, pan, pot, or skillet in the kitchen? Call me crazy but she maybe just maybe could've offered a new one in a to-go cup. I most definitely wasn't trying to bum a free drink and it was clear I hadn't consumed my now-cold tea. I ordered $30 of food so it would've been a great gesture because the tea was delish when it was hot and it would've been a great way to end the meal. #customerserviceAnyway, we waited until we couldn't anymore and I finally just took the check to the bar to pay it. The bartender ran my card quickly and with a smile :-) I would definitely return because the quality of the food and beverage is great. Prices are definitely fair based on quality. Chai tea $4 each, chicken sandwich $10(?), Upcharge to sub salad for chips $2, Bowl of tomato bisque $8 so our total was about $32 plus tip."
2015-11-12,3.5,"Raleigh, NC",Piola,"When I lived in Miami, there was a Piola across from my apartment. Coincidentally, when I moved to Raleigh, there happened to be a Piola across from my apartment as well, which was a pleasant surprise because I think there are only a handful of locations worldwide. Sensing a trend about to happen, I have to admit that Piola is extremely dangerous. Living near one - or knowing where one is - is the first step toward an addiction. The ultra thin crust, decadent toppings, and casual, lounge-inspired ambiance makes you want to go there any night you don't feel like cooking ... and even some nights you do. Piola's pizza is great, delivering a rich flavorfulness (which isn't a word, but should be if only to describe Piola's pizza) that satisfies the indulgent craving you hit when you order delivery pizza AND the gourmet edge you find at more artisan wood fired pizza houses. Piola is truly the best of all worlds. The ambiance is equally suited for a family dinner or a date night, making it a versatile, comfortable go-to pizza option."
2015-11-12,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Square Rabbit,"I have used The Square Rabbit on several occasions. They did our wedding cake which ALL of our guests raved about. At our 1 year anniversary we ordered a tiny version of our wedding cake which was spot on. Delicious!  Recently I ordered a whole quiche for a work breakfast party, and everyone loved it. I do my ordering with them via email and they are always quick to respond."
2015-11-12,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",O’Malley’s Pub & Restaurant,I have been to O'malleys quite a few times now and have always enjoyed it. They have great hours for the late night crew. It was our regular hang out spot for our hockey team after games. They have great deals on Sundays. They do 50 cent wings and $3 beers. The staff has always been pretty nice and the atmosphere is pretty solid. They sometimes have live music and also have tables with heaters outside if that is more your style. Their BTLT sandwhich is probably my favorite.  As a whole I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for a good Irish dive bar.
2015-11-12,2.0,"Charlotte, NC",Clockwork,I've been here once and probably won't return. The night I was there they were celebrating a coworkers birthday and the staff was completely obnoxious!! They were too worried about getting their drunk friend wasted and it was difficult to even get my dirty martini properly made! The music was so loud I couldn't think straight and most definitely couldn't talk to the people I was with! The decor is funky and fun but that's the only positive I took away from the experience.
2015-11-12,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Imperial Garden Chinese Restaurant,"I've had the moo shu vegetables, the veggie lo mein, szechuan tofu, and their excellent fresh spring roll. I always ask for added tofu (they can do fresh or fried), and that they don't use chicken stock- they are very accommodating. Most dishes can be made vegetarian - just ask!The sauces are excellent- not heavy with starch. Their fresh spring roll is very unique- served warm, it's a steamed wrapper with lettuce, steamed beans and other veggies in a warm sweet peanut sauce.  It's really delicious.They prefer cash for orders under $10- and their food is so inexpensive that I can't eat $10 worth at lunch!Their atmosphere is an awesome (and probably original) late 70s/early 80s kitschy Asian restaurant vibe, including a piano player.  The atmosphere, staff and food are all excellent."
2015-11-12,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Shuckers Oyster Bar & Grill,"Took the family to Shuckers Oyster Bar & Grill (510 Glenwood Ave, Raleigh)11-11-2015 for lunch. It was Veterans Day and my father and I are vets and wanted to take advantage of the deal. Service SUCKS!  Wait staff's knowledge of the menu was terrible. I glanced over the online menu the day before and knew more than she did.  Crab cakes were a 'sloppy joke'. My sister told us the Wake Forest location is much better. Wake Forest, here we come!"
2015-11-12,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",ORO Restaurant & Lounge,"Small plates with a modern, Southern edge are always in style. The loft-stye restaurant, adorned with white leather seating, a marble bar, and glimmering pendant lights, is sophisticated and intimate. Fit for a power lunch or dinner or romantic evening, ORO's menu is designed to share (or at least, swoop across the table for a bite of your company's meal). The truffle mac is a favorite for a reason - but don't limit yourself to those go-to items on the menu that you just KNOW are going to be good. Items like the chicken rice bowl are delicate, yet filling, and provide a surprising update against a the sea of ever-popular gourmet tapas options. Go ahead, order that dish you've never tried before ... you won't be disappointed."
2015-11-12,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tarbouch,"I've been coming here regularly for a year now and I can tell you first hand how great this place is. The food is delicious, healthy, and reasonably priced.

2015-11-12,5.0,"Charlotte, NC",The Players Retreat,"This is an NC STATE bar through and through. Its old and run down but there is always a wait. They have great food, anything from sandwiches to steaks! It could use some updating but they most likely never will. All of the NC STATE greats have dined here!"
2015-11-12,1.0,"Houston, TX",Garland,"I'm generally pretty wary of Asian fusion restaurants, as most of them tend to be akin to P.F. Chang's - fortunately Garland is better than that!Our first stop on our whirlwind NC tour, Garland, is set in an upscale bar, but the food they serve is pretty reasonably priced, especially for the portion size.For lunch, I ordered the Beef & Noodles - a really interesting dish; I thought it tasted like pad thai + Vietnamese rice vermicelli bowl (bun thit) + Korean bulgogi. True Asian fusion! It was refreshing to eat on a warmer Raleigh day, and I felt better about myself since it was served on top of a bunch of greens heh.My friends and I also split their Moroccan ""hummus"" with which the chickpeas were whole, not mashed/pureed like a typical hummus. Pretty tasty and different from most chickpea dishes I've had.Overall, a very solid introduction to our trip to NC. If I lived in Raleigh, I would definitely try their Indian (also Asian, don't you forget it!) influenced foods!"
2015-11-12,4.0,"Midtown, Atlanta, GA",Kadhai The Indian Wok,"This is my favorite restaurant in Raleigh.  Simply because of the food.  It is consistently delicious.  The wait staff is really nice too.  Helpful enough, but not in your face.  Best Indian food I've had to date!"
2015-11-12,5.0,"New York, NY",Seoul Garden Restaurant,"Pleasantly surprised to find this little gem in North Raleigh. A little out of the way for us, but worth the drive to have some decent Korean food. Went on a Saturday afternoon with hubby and 1 year old in tow... we were seated right away. Service was fast and friendly and the portion sizes were small, but the food was pretty decent. We ordered the Kalbi Jhim (braised short ribs in sweet soy sauce), which was amazeballz! Definitely recommend it! The combination soondubu (tofu pot with beef and seafood) and the Japchae (yam noodle with beef and veggies), both were only ok in my book, I've definitely had better. Overall a pleasant experience. The manager came over to check on us twice, so that was nice. We'll definitely be back to try the BBQ next time. :)"
2015-11-12,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kimbap,I adore this place! First time I went I got a taco special they had with fried rice. Their fried rice is amazing! This time I did their Bipbimbap bowl with tofu for lunch take out. Their staff is always so nice and food comes out quickly. I like their location too. Prices are right as well. A lot of their dinner menus are the same as lunch just a couple bucks less for lunch time.
2015-11-12,5.0,"Charlotte, NC",Mitch’s Tavern,Fabulous local spot right next to the college! Prices are so low and its a lot of food for the money! This bar has been around for a long time and its an NC STATE staple!!!
2015-11-12,4.0,"Charlotte, NC",Busy Bee Cafe,I have 3 words for you: LOADED TATOR TOTS!!! I always get the burger with pimento cheese and the loaded tots and I'm never disappointed. So many beers to choose from too. They also have a hidden patio and The Hive upstairs.
2015-11-12,4.0,"Morrisville, NC",Raleigh Times Bar,"While Raleigh Times may be one of the most congested bars in Raleigh late on Friday and Saturday nights, it's atmosphere for lunch and dinner any day of the week is great. If you're lucky, you'll sit in Brian's section! I've been here plenty and managed to score him as my server quite a few times and he is always SO wonderful. Julie served us at lunch yesterday and she was so friendly and definitely on top of things. All the bartenders are great and knowledgable about all the beers they serve. The rooftop and sidewalk seating is awesome on a warm, sunny day. The food is great and the menu changes slightly seasonally. I recommend the Korean Beef Tacos, the Peruvian wings, the kale salad, the pork tacos, the nachos, the pimento cheese, the Mac-n-quack, the chicken tenders, and the burrito (try it with pork!). Actually I would eat most anything on their menu. Like I said, if you don't like crowds, stay away on the weekends because they definitely get busy! But their staff has it together from what I can tell."
2015-11-12,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Taverna Agora,"Taverna Agora was an exceptional experience from start to finish. I called a few days ahead to make a reservation for a Friday evening and the lady that answered the phone was polite and informed me that the first Friday of each month is their Greek Night. While some people might like a phone call reminder, I received two text reminders regarding my reservation.The restaurant is located on hillsborough street and I wasn't familiar with Taverna Agora when they were located on glenwood south. I thought the location was great as it is a few steps from Second Empire. The parking was a bit challenging and I ended up in a $4 lot across the street.When we walked in I noticed all of the wood from the floor to the beams, I loved it! It did remind me of a restaurant I went to in Greece last fall. Tastefully and authentically decorated with a modern flare. We were seated immediately and our server Jordan came to our table right away. The restaurant was extremely busy however Jordan did an amazing job and never missed a beat! We started with a bottle of their Pinot noir and the Greek tasting platter. The manager Albert greeted us at the table and engulfed us with our wine questions. The platter had calamari, hummus, tzatziki, and spicy feta spreads. I loved everything except for the spicy feta spread although I'm not a big feta cheese lover. My friend at all of it and he loved it! For our entrees, we decided to share the paidakia-lamb chops and the mousaka-baked casserole. The entrees were amazing, seasoned well, and bursting with flavors. For dessert we tried the baklava cheesecake which was excellent.Overall my dining experience here was excellent. I have to especially mention the service from Jordan and the manager Albert, one word AMAZING! I will definitely be back to try some of their other dishes."
2015-11-12,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Coquette Brasserie,"Coquette is a fantastic, traditional French brasserie. The sprawling café style seating is reminiscent of the many small gastropubs sprinkled throughout Paris - complete with black and white mosaic floors, scrolled iron tables, wicker chairs, and red leather accent banquettes. After you've indulged in a glass of wine from the European-infused wine list, you'll enjoy a selection of savory appetizers, such as the duck liver pate or charcuterie platter. Comforting, French countryside favorites - think: cassoulet, steak or moules frites, and coq au vin - fill the menu with the traditional flavors that make French food such a favorite. This casual, yet sumptuous, restaurant allows you to enjoy the dishes you'd expect at a fine dining establishment in a more accessible venue fit for weeknights out, celebrations that don't require white linen tablecloths, and those nights when you just need a really exceptional fit of wine and cheese."
2015-11-12,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Rye Bar & Southern Kitchen,"Forgettable is the nicest way to put it. With so many other amazing places to eat in Raleigh, Rye is very disappointing. We started off with the fried oysters which tasted just like the fried skin on a fried chicken. I got the Chicken Pot Pie with mac and cheese and herb roasted potatoes. I want to say I maybe took 5 bites. Like it wasn't terrible but it wasn't good at all either. My boyfriend had the Beaufort supper and was also unhappy. Needless to say we will not be going back."
2015-11-12,4.0,"Midtown, Atlanta, GA",Relish Café & Bar,Relish is one of the best restaurants in raleigh!  The service is always wonderful and the food is always tasty.  Overall wonderful atmosphere.  You have to try the Parisian grilled cheese and the tomato soup.  The chocolate chess pie is also to die for!  Love me some relish :)

After looking at the menu the unique burgushi items were intriguing. After the waiters glowing recommendations to try them we went for it! My friend and I split two different burger/sushi entrees and it was fantastic! Would recommend highly! Reasonably priced and fun environment.Charlotte, Raleigh NC and Universal Orlando are the lucky people who can enjoy Cowfish. GO NOW!"
2015-11-12,1.0,"Norfolk, VA",Rye Bar & Southern Kitchen,"Met my big brother near his office here.  The area is really nice, and this hotel in the bottom of the hotel is very nice.  The food is good, and the cocktail was even mixed very well.  In my opinion, the food is a tad overpriced for what it is, but it was prepared really well and extremely tasty.  Cant say I'd go back as my own first choice, but if you;re already in downtown and want a nice, quiet place to have quality vittles, this is a great choice."
2015-11-12,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Jose and Sons,"Went here for dinner the other night and we were pleasantly surprised at how great the food and service was. Just passing by this place it kinda looks like another run of the mill Mexican restaurants but once you sit down and try out the menu it really is anything but that. The menu is more of a Southern meets Mexican blend with influences from both coming into play. For example, we started off trying the Gouda Mac N' Queso and the Ceviche. While the Ceviche was pretty standard in my opinion the Gouda Mac N' Queso was out of this world delicious. Our waitress said a lot of people turn away from it because it has macaroni noodles included but if you are already a fan of white cheese dip at mexican restaurants then this is a MUST TRY. We straight up used the Mac N' Queso for dipping our tortilla chips and it was the best dip I've ever had out. For the main course I ordered their Chicharron and Waffles. This is basically pork belly cracklins seasoned and fried on top of a huge corn based waffle. They also serve this up with 2 poached eggs on top and all together it makes for a gut busting dish. I can't wait to go back to try some of their other menu items......and get some more of the Gouda Mac N' Cheese"
2015-11-12,3.0,"Charlotte, NC",Trophy Brewing Company,Probably my favorite brewery that I have ever been too. I have never had a bad beer from them.

Everything is very affordable and the baristas are genuinely friendly with the guests and are always interacting with one another. I love the breakfast burrito! While the downstairs may seem small, there is a huge upstairs area with plenty of seating. I also enjoy seeing the rotating art by local artists that they have on display. As far as pastries, they have a variety of options and they do seem to change regularly, but try to snag some macarons and a white chocolate cranberry cookie if you can!"
2015-11-13,4.5,"Raleigh, NC",Hayes Barton Café & Dessertery,"The best date night place I have been to in Raleigh so far! Such a romantic atmosphere! Walked in on a friday for a date night and asked for a table for 2. The owner seated us immediately, but then realized he had a reservation coming in. As compensation he moved us to the bar area and gave us 50% off our check. The ambience is super romantic and interesting. I ordered the Rita Hayworth margarita, which was to my delight one of the strongest cocktails I'd ever gotten from a restaurant. They provided us with an assortment of bread, which included this pumpkin cornbread that was so moist and delish! For entrees we stuffed our face with meatloaf and heirloom tomato pie with steak. My steak was cooked perfectly and the tomato pie was balanced and not too rich; the meatloaf was moist and flavorful and the size of the Titanic. #leftoversfordaysHaving eaten enough for 5, we ordered the key lime pie and pumpkin cheesecake to go. They were of course exorbitantly sized and exorbitantly rich. I was a fan of how balanced in flavor both desserts were, but the key lime was a little eggs tasting...makes sense but I would ordered something else.All in all a fantastic and kooky place!"
2015-11-13,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tenko Japan,"I've had takeout from Tenko so many times, and I have never been disappointed. Food is always fresh and fast, and consistently delicious. I normally get the hibachi shrimp and scallops, and my boyfriend gets the chicken and shrimp. We've also had the spring rolls. They are a little inconsistent with charging for extra sauces, but I don't mind paying for it."
2015-11-13,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Poppyseed Market,"I went to dinner last night for the first time here. I have been for lunch several times. I don't understand the need for switching from counter orders to sitting down with a menu at night. The atmosphere is hollow and cold and doesn't warrant menu seating.The food and wine were really good.  My friends both got the salmon special and I was jealous!!  My vodka farfalle was DROWNING in sauce and just 'too much'.  The scallops on my pasta were wonderful :)We did have an interesting conversation with a woman who stopped by our table and interjected herself upon our conversation. We had no idea who she was and she was loud and vocal about her political views (hence, belligerent about mine....). The waitress was very apologetic and knew who she was.  It was an unfortunate intrusion as we were discussing some serious family issues."
2015-11-13,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tarbouch,"Wonderful food, good sized portions well worth the money. The Hummus and Pita is the best part, and a side of To-go hummus lasted us a few days!"

2015-11-13,1.0,"Clayton, NC",Sullivan’s Steakhouse,"This was an okay place to try, but I prefer a few other steak houses over this place. First, can I just say, usually for a steak house you expect the ladies to dress a little less revealing. But on my anniversary dinner, I'm not much in the mood for seeing a bunch of ladies in short short skirts handing out food and cleaning tables. I expected a little more professional dress. Our waitress was nice and attentive, and kept a check on us. The food was okay but not what I expected for the price. The steak was a good texture and cooked as I ordered, but didn't have a good flavor. the sides were awesome, mac and cheese and scalloped potatoes? Delicious. Dessert was a little lacking as well. For the quality, you could probably go to Longhorn, or another similar chain and get the same quality."
2015-11-13,2.0,"Holly Springs, NC",Cristo’s NY Style Pizza,"I wouldn't give them any stars if I could....I ordered pizza from there for the first time and it was not a pleasant experience. First, I was told my wait was an hour. So I go to the restaurant to pick up my pizza an hour later and I was told they were behind. No problem it happens to the best. However I should not be in your establishment another 30-40 minutes still waiting after I already waited an hour. Second, the people were unfriendly. I guess if you are not a usual you mean nothing to them as a customer. Not to mention the way I saw how they treated other people who waited longer than I did. The employees were acting like some customers were an inconvenience. Not to mention, i m not sure if it was the owner or manager but he was obnoxious to an employee in front of people. Not okay in my book. Third and most importantly this did NOT taste anything like NY pizza! It was soggy and had this weird taste like it had mold on it at some point. First time I threw the pizza away. I grew up in NY not sure why they think they can claim NY pizza it was disgusting.Lastly, they started to turn customers away for the night before their closing time...what kind of business does that??? So least to say...I will not be back for these reasons."
2015-11-13,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Vinos Finos Tapas and Wine Bar,"I went last Friday evening with my wife and two daughters (old enough to drink daughters). This was exactly what we were looking for - wine and small plates in a cozy atmosphere after everyone's tiring work week. We thought the food was very inventive and sure was tasty. They have wine flights, like the more well known beer and whiskey flights, that was a great way to sample several wines in a category. The service was great too. Bacon wrapped dates and duck/sweet potato empanadas were my favorite. We'll definitely be back."
2015-11-13,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",P.G. Werth’s,"This is a nice place that should work in downtown.  The food is pricey for the portion size, but it has always been quite good.   It's rarely crowded.  If you haven't been here yet you should come."
2015-11-13,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Clouds Brewing,"Went for dinner and drinks on a Thursday night hoping to find a good spot to watch football and clouds delivered. As many people have already said, they have a wall of taps which is basically a self-we've bar that cuts you off after 32 ounces. Very cool idea but the execution is ehh. I found myself (and many others) getting about 50% foam and 50% beer. Beer choices were funky too. I also got a bottle of beer from their ""limited edition"" section seeing that it said Thursday's were ""half off bottles"" on the wall. Gotta say, they could have made it clearer that ""half off bottles"" applies to wine and not beer.The food made up for it. I had the nachos and substituted chicken for bratwurst. The nachos were some of the best that I've ever had and I will definitely be returning for more. Service was okay, but definitely could have been better based on the number of people at the bar. The staff was friendly, but inattentive. Overall, they lose a star for the service and the confusing ""half off bottles"" special."
2015-11-13,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bella Monica,"I've eaten here several times and the food has been consistently good, sometimes great. Service is generally fine, however they certainly fawn over me when I'm with a man versus meeting a girlfriend. They have a nice selection of wines, the menu is a bit overpriced imo, and their happy hour is fun but the champagne cocktails are not traditional -- they're mostly juice, versus a true one which is just a couple drops of liqueur for flavoring the champagne. Definitely need reservations as they are crowded for lunch and dinner."
2015-11-13,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",MOD Pizza,"We got this to go this past week. My husband got the Mad Dog pizza and I built my own.  They have a ton of veggies and other toppings and different types of cheeses to pick from.  It's awesome because they don't charge extra for the toppings, I had 8 toppings on mine and it was the same price as if i had 1 topping! Both of our pizzas were fresh and super tasty.  The regular sized pizza is more than enough for one person."
2015-11-13,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Jose and Sons,Barbacoa and fish tacos are amazing!!!! Drinks were strong and delicious as well. Already looking forward to our next visit.
2015-11-13,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Standard Foods,"This review is for the grocery only.  I have not dined in at the restaurant.  It's hard to fathom that a year beyond the scheduled opening for the grocery has yielded such a pitiful store.  The produce is way over-priced.  Although it looks fresh and well cared for, please, people, go to your farmer's markets for these produce items.  The mark-up at this location is shameful. On to the ready to eat case- a good selection of prepared foods that look good in the case.  The server was eager and friendly to portion out my take-home items.  But she had a half-eaten/served/whateverIdon'tknow portion of kabocha salad in another container that she brought from under/beside/whereverIdon'tknow of the case and dumped on top of what she had spooned into my take-home container.  Don't do that!! Why on earth would you do that in front of a customer?? I took home that kabocha salad, sweet potato gratin and braised (?) pork loin with apples and onions.  The pork was overdone to the point where pork takes on an entirely different flavor.  The kabocha and gratin where inviting to the eyes, but the flavors just were not there, and very very starchy.  My palate kinda collapsed, those two dishes were so starchy.I also brought home a quart of frozen chicken stock, a quart of butternut squash soup and a 12 oz bag of Full Bloom coffee beans, which I think were all reasonably priced.I really don't think I can go back for ready to eat items.  Whole Foods has nothing to worry about, folks.  I'd like to dine in at the restaurant and return to this review to bring it up a bit.  I am optimistic. I hope I don't have the kind of experience where I conclude any/all AC restaurants have nothing to worry about."
2015-11-13,4.0,"Wilson, NC",The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar,"Okay, this place was just amazing! I LOVED it! Our server was super friendly! We started off with the crab rangoon dip! The chips were super crunchy and the dip was so tasty! I'm not a big fan of that dip at other places but Cowfish has changed my mind! It was a tough decision for the entree. They have tons of variety for sushi. They also have build your own sushi! Then they have things in sushi that you would never expect. This lead me to my entree. I ordered the All-American Bacon Double Cheeseburgooshi. It looks like sushi but tastes like an amazing burger! It's a double cheeseburger with bacon, wrapped in fried potatoes (which tasted like hash browns) and topped with ketchup, mustard, pickle and a diced tomatoes. Like I said AMAZING burger. I'm sold on Cowfish! I'll definitely go again!"
2015-11-14,4.5,"Raleigh, NC",Sosta Café,"This is a very quaint cafe. The owner is one of the nicest people manning a restaurant locally. I had the basil sandwich, as well as the chickpea and Israeli couscous salads, and both were delicious."
2015-11-14,3.5,"Youngsville, NC",Flights Restaurant & Lounge,"3 stars in generous. The food was just ok (warm at best), the beer was warm and the service was horrible. At this level of a restaurant I expect the service to match. To have dirty bottles and dishes on the table throughout the meal is not on par with a $$$ restaurant. Won't go back."
2015-11-14,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tarbouch,"Very delicious, large menu with healthy options, great prices, and pretty decent delivery time.  I'll be ordering again the next time I'm too lazy to leave the house."
2015-11-14,4.0,"Durham, NC",Brio Tuscan Grille,"Great selection and service!  All tables are in one large room, so the din can be a little deafening.  It was difficult to hear and replay to my friend who sat across from me.  Again, food and service were great!"
2015-11-14,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Glenwood Grill,"The Glenwood Grill.  Wonderful place.  I moved into my new home a few miles North off of Glenwood and would sometimes shop at the Harris Teeter that is in the same strip mall plaza.  I used to see the Glenwood Grill and thought that I would eventually go by to see the fare.  Great food.  Good ambiance.  Small intimate feel to the restaurant.  Romantic.  I cannot wait to get a girlfriend or a significant other to bring here.  Which goes to my first point of why this place is so great...When you arrive you are warmly greeted by the MAITRE D' who seemed like he knew the names and faces of the regulars.  I am a single guy who walked in off the street.  Although this seems to be a reservation preferred establishment and the place stays packed, the maitre d' took the time to find me a spot at the bar.  The service was still top notch and everyone tried to be attentive and make me feel welcome.  The food was EXCELLENT!  I went back again, alone, without reservation, on a packed Friday night.  I was immediately recognized by the maitre d' AND the bar tender.  There wasn't a seat in the house that was unreserved.  The maitre d' explained that there was at least a 30 minute wait, but then said ""wait a minute...do you mind sitting near the door?"" which I replied ""no"".   There was enough room for him to quickly make a single person spot at the end of the bench seating near the door.  Again, this took extra effort and the maitre d' was going ABOVE and Beyond to make sure they has another satisfied customer.  I mentioned to him that out of all of the wonderful places I have discovered in the Raleigh area since moving here, the Glenwood Grill is my FAVORITE and he is sure to see my face there a lot.Finally, the food is great as I stated earlier.  But not only is it delicious and served with excellent presentation, I was surprised to see that they will occasionally change the menu.  Unlike some restaurants that have stale menus that stay the same year after year, the Glenwood Grill will change theirs.  I found that to be exciting.  The menu is not overly complicated with pages upon pages of selections, but rather a precise, well thought out composition of gourmet dishes.  I wanted to try everything on the menu, and looked on with envy at every plate that passed by going to other customers.  My last visit (last night) was a dinner that consisted of a seafood fare (She-crab soup, Lobster Pot Pie, and Seafood and Grits.  Wow!"

2015-11-14,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",P.G. Werth’s,"The first time we stopped in here was shortly after they opened.  We checked out their menus but nothing was calling out to us, so we moseyed on.  I'm happy to report that they've really worked on the menus and now offer a wonderful selection including a ""Munch"" menu that is available all day!Four of us did Sunday brunch a few weeks ago.  I made reservations for noon, but we wouldn't have had a problem getting a table.  There is indoor and outdoor seating.  Indoors for us.  We had a wonderful Server gal who took very good care of us, even managing to keep Husband in coffee (which is no easy task).  Choices, choices!  The brunch menu alone has enough enticing options, but when confronted with their Munch menu as well, it was hard to decide.  Two of us opted for the Farmer's Benedict:  Moonflour crostini, zucchini, fried egg, spinach, heirloom tomato corn salsa, basil hollandaise.  Another went with Shrimp n Grits: Shrimp, pimento cheese grits, pork belly-basil gravy, and Husband went with simple but good:  P.G.'s B & G: Pimento cheese biscuits, white pepper gravy, country ham, 2 eggs, hash brown bites.Loved that they were flexible in that they let us substitute poached eggs for the fried.  And bacon for the country ham.  I also ordered a side of bacon, which came out too limp for my taste, and they were kind enough to accommodate my wish for crispier.  Excellent bacon...highly recommend!  The moonflour crostini, by the way, was rather unusual.  It was thick and soft.  When I hear crostin, I think crisp, but this is definitely different.While high quality, portions are not crazy big, so we even had room for a little dessert.  Husband scarfed down a delicious chocolate chip pecan pie, while I tried a gluten-free blueberry ""crisp"".  Again, no crisp.  This tasted like blueberries with cornstarch.  Very thick, in a slightly unpleasant way.  I would skip that one next time.Note:  it gets VERY loud in their dining room.  Which makes everyone talk even louder.  There were some very shrill moments.Parking:  This can be a bit of a challenge in this area.  The building is at the corner of Hillsborough and Morgan in the new apartment building near Irregardless and Goodnights.  We were able to find a spot on a street around the corner.TIP:  They have some great-sounding drinks, including $11 bottomless mimosas for brunch!"

While the service was great and the food was tasty, there is nothing that makes me want/need to return soon. Maybe my expectations were too high based on previous reviews, but Mandolin dishes fell short of amazing on my visit."

2015-11-14,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kadhai The Indian Wok,"This a good place to get Northern Indian food. The have a good selection of vegetarian dishes as well. There is also many meat dishes for people to choose from. I ordered the Chana Peshwari.  It is a chickpea dish in a creamy tomato sauce. I ordered it at a medium spiciness level and that was enough for me. I also ordered the Masala tea. My boyfriend ordered the Lamb curry. Both were good, as was my tea.The Naan however left a little to be desired. It is supposed to be cooked in a Tandoori oven. This was just baked with a little olive oil. I think this cooking of the Naan was to accommodate a more western pallate. The service was okay. I sat with out my water refilled for a few minutes. I know they were busy, I really need my water for my spicy food."

2015-11-14,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Oak City Meatball Shoppe,"We got take out, which was fast and easy. The traditional meatballs with meat sauce were fantastic on top of spaghetti, though the kale salad with red onions was too acidic for me -- the vinegar seemed really tart.

I've found the staff to be engaging and attentive, not at all aloof. I love the green color scheme, and it's in a great location. A vegan restaurant is such a welcome addition to the area. The only caveat is the slightly small space, so as this is a happening place, do get here early. :)"

There were 15 open tables around 4:56 pm on a Saturday night. I was not given an opportunity to be given a table due to ""the upcoming reservations were coming in"". However, tis was an after thought after the hotness and the manager looked my brother and I up and down as black men and given the response of there are no tables to be given to us. The young hostess was very sorry, however I will not be frequenting this establishment ever again. Due to the treatment of being judged by my appearance and not my recognition of my character and the ability to pay for my meal. It's not that the hostess apologize but that there was not even an attempt to fit my brother and I in just for a short meal."
2015-11-14,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gravy,"This is a fun place to eat farm to table Italian food. So the cocktail list is extensive and everything on it is delicious. I had the Creamsicle and the lemon cello mojito. I like the Creamsicle much better. For my appetizer I had the risotto balls. Very delicious. Gooey cheesy goodness in a deep fried ball. Others in my group had the calimari. I tried it, it was good. However, I prefer those risotto balls.For my meal, I had what Gravy is known for, the gnocchi. I have loved gnocchi is I was a child. This is the best gnocchi I have found in the US. They were fluffy and pan fried in a decadent truffle mushroom cream sauce. For my desert I had the budoni. It was very good. It was a chocolate moose with a salted almond caramel top. We were given instruction on how to eat it, to get all of the flavors in it. We also ordered the French Press coffee and it was of good flavor. It was served properly with rock sugar. The wait staff were quite attentive. Never once did a glass go empty. Never once did we have to ask for something we needed. They asked us if we needed anything without being annoying which was great. Having said all of that, please do yourself a favor and make a reservation when you go here. If not the line is usually 30 min to 65 min at night. I made my reservation a week out as I was in a party for 6. Please please make a reservation."

The manager lied to me when she told me they have a call ahead but not a reservation policy (only party of 8). However everyone that was on the list under us was seated ahead, which indicates to me (unless I'm just crazy) that they called after I arrived. I understand you want to fill tables with 3 or more guest before a party of two, but at some point you have to go back seat the two(s). Which never happened until I got Black on her. As for the food, who knows I was too pissed to eat! She compt. Our appetizers (slow hand clap) and I order ONE tiny fish taco, my husband greedy butt eat gumbo loved it. I wouldn't take it out on the waiter, so I tipped him as if we both eat with appetizers. Some Blacks do tip!"

I'm in love with the Frenchie Burger--it's turkey meat with Brie cheese, garlic mayo, grilled apples, bacon, lettuce, red onion (I remove these), and tomato... To me, it's just down right delicious. Also, for two bucks more, you can't beat the option for the side salad... The burger is my ""guilt,"" but the salad sure makes up for it (and the ingredients are really fresh). The vibe at this location is great and so are the people. In fact, between the customer service and food, it would be hard for me to pick one over the other. I'll keep coming back to this place!"

Saw some single guys eating alone there - what a great place for them to grab a nice hot meal at the lunch buffet. You can get a takeout buffet with a naan, 1 styrofoam box and a plastic container. Their chili chicken is great - don't accidentally put a large piece of jalapeno in your mouth thinking it's a green pepper! Other things we've liked - plain saag, chana saag, chicken tikka kabobs so you can have dry instead of the cream all the time and the vegetable pakoras,"

Soggy is the overall diagnosis on texture. Calamari was flavorful but soggy. Grease needed to be hotter...The wedge salad was good but needed dressing...The ABT w/duck egg...bread was soggy. Egg was overcooked.  Soggy. The house made chips were oily and...you guessed it...soggy. Service was slow and not particularly attentive. Friendly but just a little clueless. Apparently there were specials...who knew?!?  Billing-i'd like the opportunity to read my bill without the server hovering & tipping should be a choice not starting at 18%.Not cool to hear the chef complain about  a table who wanted butter with their biscuits. We has to ask for our drinks...well after our first dish was delivered. So....we may try again, but it may be a while as there are a lot if great options for brunch in Raleigh."
2015-11-15,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Pho Vietnam,"I go to Pho Vietnam at least between once or twice a week both for lunch and dinner. The staff is really nice and remembers you when you go as often as I do. I normally get the Pho Ga, the chicken noodle soup. I found the broth here is the most flavorful out of all the other Vietnamese restaurants in the triangle. It is always served really hot with plenty of basil, lime and jalapeños. You get the option of getting the small or large. I alternate between the two, depending on how hungry I'm feeling. Both sizes come with a generous portion of noddles and chicken. I would recommend this to anyone that hasn't had an experience with Pho before. It is a great anytime soup. I've also tried the Lemongrass Bah mi. The bread is always fresh with a slightly crispy exterior and soft interior. The vegetables that come in it are always fresh and with great flavor. A great option if you are on the go or want to try something besides their delicious Pho."
2015-11-15,1.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Shaba Shabu,"I never felt more insulted or disrespected by a restaurant before until my girlfriend and I TRIED to have lunch at Shabu Shabu. We went there on a whim before our planned grocery trip to Trader Joe's. It was a little after noon on a Saturday, prime time for lunch I would think but we walked in and there was no one at the hostess stand. No biggie, we weren't in a rush so we perused the take-out menu. A few minutes later a waiter walked up to the hostess stand to get something and didn't even acknowledge our presence. A few more minutes later another staff member in the room to the right made eye contact with us but also did absolutely nothing. A few more minutes later, another staff member walks right past us and doesn't say a single word. In total, we stood there for nearly 10 mins while 3 different staff members ignored us and never got seated. I can't say anything bad about there food as we never got the opportunity to try but if this is the kind of service they provide even superb food would not be worth giving this place my business. I strongly urge anyone reading this to prepare yourself as it could happen to you."
2015-11-15,3.0,"Durham, NC",Monapita Mediterranean Grill,"After reading this all of these positive reviews, I had to give this place a visit. In a nondescript shopping center off of Capital Blvd., Monapita is a gem. My friend and I both ordered the veggie platter. Even at 1:45pm on a Saturday afternoon, there were several customers eating inside and out. In just a few.minutes after placing our order, we were greeted with a plate full of crispy and moist falafel, rich Baba Ghanoush, creamy hummus, fresh tabouli , and warm grilled pita. We quickly inhaled. I would argue this is some of the best falafel in the Triangle. Well seasoned, not too much parsley. I would highly recommend this restaurant to all Mediterranean food fans!"

2015-11-15,5.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Plates Neighborhood Kitchen,"My friends and I drove from Chapel Hill to check out some bars in Raleigh and decided to stop for dinner beforehand. We wondered along Glenwood and decided to go into Plates because it seemed quiet and trendy with a good ambiance (and of course because it has two $ and 4 stars on Yelp).Atmosphere:There weren't too many people at the restaurant, but it's probably because it was a Sunday night and there was a WWE fight and some football games and Plates doesn't have TVs. The ambiance is indeed pleasant, with low lit (but not too low) indoor seating, and extensive outdoor seating with heaters. The place has a tasteful amount of decor that gives it a lively feel. The staff is very friendly. FoodThe food is delicious!! Although the choices of food is what led me to give this 4 stars. I was looking for a primarily non-seafood, protein dish at a reasonable price and couldn't find exactly what I wanted. There was a steak dish that was too expensive, a chicken and dumplings dish that was more like chicken soup when I was looking for something dry, a ""catch of the day"" dish, and a pasta (pumpkin carbonara) dish that seemed delicious but had very little meat in it. I ended up going for the pumpkin carbonara (and not regretting it!), which would have been ideal with pieces of chicken on it, but they only had the option of adding seafood such as shrimp and fish.Furthermore, as an appetizer I ordered the soup of the day - butternut squash soup with roasted walnuts. The dish was not exactly what I expected, but it was delicious nonetheless. I got a plate with two large pieces of toasted bread and the soup was served in a small, sauce-serving dish. Overall, the food was VERY delicious but it was more carb-y than I anticipated / wanted.I can't say too much about the gluten free options here, but I was with a gluten free friend and the waiter pointed out about half of the main dinner courses as gluten free.I would definitely go here again."

They only take credit card (no cash). They close at 8:45pm. Atmosphere was very quiet. Overall service was great.

Well, thankfully the pep pizza was really good and worth the price! I've only been there a few times but I'll be going back more! Also a tip, their largest pizza is pretty small (in my American, overeating, opinion) it's about 3 slices for 2 people but they are pretty small. Still really good though!!"

2015-11-15,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mi Cancun,"We were a little hesitant to go here, since the previous Mexican place in this location was nothing thrilling, but after seeing the good reviews and checking out their menu, four of us gave it a go for Sunday lunch.  All of us agree that it is very good!Menu is extensive with a lot of healthier options available as well as plenty of heartier ones.  Prices are very reasonable and service was great!Fresh salsa and chips...very tasty and plentiful.  Loved that they let me have 2 different tacos...Had a shrimp/chorizo/pineapple one and a spinach/jalapeno veggie one, along with very good beans & rice.  They honored my request for corn tortillas, which were good, but because they were soft and the fillings were juicy, I had to quickly abandon the taco stand and go for it with knife and fork.  Messy but oh-so-good!Others enjoyed their choices of Chicken Santa Fe and Chori-Pollo and Chori-Pollo Burrito.My only slight dislike was the strong chemical cleaning-fluid smell in the restaurant.  Nice that the place is clean, but it's not my favorite odor, and it wouldn't keep me from going back.  Very happy to have this nice new place close to home in North Raleigh!Note:  Plenty of specials to be had here as well."
2015-11-15,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sardi’s Den,"My wife and I visited Sardi's Den for the first time the other day to check it out. We ordered a couple of drinks and they took quite a while to be delivered to the table. When the waitress came over to take our order we asked how long she thought it would take for us to get our food. She was honest with us, saying ""Well, to be truthful, things are moving very slowly tonight, the kitchen staff doesn't have their act together. It could take quite a while."" I thought the fact that she told us was great, and because of her I made this review 3 stars instead of 1 or 2. We may try again some day because I've heard good things about the restaurant from other people, and will be glad to revise this review when we have a better experience."

2015-11-15,5.0,"Denver, CO",Gravy,"We came here while visiting my brother from out of town. We love Italian food, specifically authentic Italian food; more importantly we love good food and fast service combined. Gravy has both of these. Gravy sources local ingredients, with details on the origin of the meat, and there are a variety of local spirits in interesting cocktails.  We were greeted kindly, there was no wait, and appetizer and bread were served quickly. *The risotto balls are amazing, order them if you want a fast crunchy app** I ordered the gnocchi because I was lured by the variety of mushrooms and truffle oil. Usually I am critical of gnocchi, thinking they are too doughy. These were **perfect**. My partner ordered the lasagna, which was tasty but a bit cheese-heavy; there could be more sauce. My sister-in-law ordered the mushroom ravioli, which she said was tasty but she prefers a thicker sauce. This was more soupy. We had the budino for dessert, and the flavor and texture combination were lovely. Our server was attentive and friendly! We would return here if we lived in Raleigh."

But if you want some great tacos (cheap) and some good drinks go here.  It's a total local place and that's what I like about it.  Nice and easy and you can get food quick before going to see a movie (right next door) and then come back after for some drinks! The also have some great veggie options which even I as a meat eater love.  They have awesome bloodys ($4 on Sunday!).  Just need to try their brunch menu now.
2015-11-15,4.0,"Magnolia, NC",Driftwood Southern Kitchen,"4 couples went. Only 3 of the 8 liked their food. The 3 all ordered shrimp and grits. Add a stick of butter and some cheese and grits will taste good! The waiter rushed us through the whole meal. Explained to us about their slow smoking process on their meats and didn't recommend any of these items, go figure. His recommendations were shrimp and grits and country fried chicken. 1 had pork shoulder and mac and cheese, he couldn't finish it. 1 had meatloaf and mashed potatoes, not good. Brussels sprouts were cooked at least 6 hrs before. They were mushy and had a sweet bacon taste. Not good. Grilled chicken on wedge salad looked like it had been microwaved. No grill marks and all white. Kinda gross. Appetizers were mediocre, cheddar biscuits, pimento cheese and fried green tomatoes. Nothing except the shrimp and grits tasted freshly made. Disappointed. Will check Driftwood off our list."

I tried mango salsa, cinnamon peanut butter...and then promptly stocked up on 8 different items to give as holiday gifts. I gave in and ordered mac'n'cheese (the classic) and wasn't disappointed. Everyone at my table ordered wine flights (at $11, how can you go wrong?), and we ended up sharing a platter of 4 salsas (tomato cranberry was hands down my favorite). Couldn't believe that dinner + wine flight + shared app came in under $25. Not bad! As for atmosphere, it seemed like a diverse crowd: some families, some girl's nights, a large party...nothing fancy, but definitely warm and cozy - with nice service. I'd go again!"

Tamago and eel was good.Beef Sukiyaki: nice flavor and huge portion. I would like to have more soup/sauce with it.Definitely will come back to try other things."

I really liked their beers, as they seem to take a particular style and add their twist to it. Not just a standard list of styles. Loved the Best in Show, a citra Saison. My wife had a nice spiced sangria that she really liked as well. We liked the looks of the pizza they were serving so much we went back the next day for lunch.

2015-11-15,5.0,"Knightdale, NC",Sitti,"Great place.  I can easily say this is my favorite place in downtown Raleigh.  The food here is special.  Over the last couple of years it has become a little less spunky, which I miss, but nonetheless, it is good.  I regularly get the mixed grill or kafta kabob platter, the garlic whip alone is worth it to me.  The samkeh hara (sp) is a salmon dish they prepare with what I think is kale and rice and it is the best salmon you will have in town without having the get a second mortgage on the house.  There is something that must be said about places that marinate their meats before cooking them and this place does it very well.  The chicken is NEVER dry, the kafta is juicy, and the steak is always tender.  Their appetizers are also very special from the avocado hummus to the baba ghanoush.  Try the lamb, you heard the aunt in my big fat greek wedding, even vegetarians can eat it (don't do it though if you ARE a vegetarian - something about the flora in your gut).My only complaint is that it gets a little loud sometimes.  The place is wide open and almost always full, so everyone is trying to talk over each other."
2015-11-15,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sitti,"Pretty great overall. The hummus and grape leaves were really very good, and I had a glass of delightful Lebanese white wine.

Between the two of us, my husband and I had chicken, slaw, corn, rice and beans, fried yucca, and fried sweet plantains. Everything was so delicious, I couldn't decide which item I loved the most. The yellow sauce is very mild--possible mayonnaise based. The green sauce is tasty but very spicy. I could only eat it mixed with the yellow one. The restaurant itself is clean and comfortable with beautiful photos of Peru on the walls. They also had two televisions broadcasting CNN."
2015-11-16,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Oak,"With a nod to the City of Oaks' namesake, you have to have higher expectations coming into this intimate bourbon bar. While sitting at the rustic wooden bar - laden with your choice of bourbons, whiskies, and other indulgent, dark liquors of course - flanked by floor to ceiling windows giving you a view of lush oaks outside the restaurant, you can't help but feeling that The Oak delivers something that is uniquely ""Raleigh."" The ambiance is as sophisticated as the artisan drink menu, without teetering into pretentiousness (thanks, in part, to the Southerni-fied menu of cheese fritters and loaded french fries that bring you back down to earth from your oh so charming cocktail snobbery). The Oak is fun and romantic at the same time, making it a great Friday night go-to hot spot or a tentative first date locale when you want to impress but not overwhelm."
2015-11-16,4.0,"Durham, NC",Person Street Pharmacy,"Stopped in for lunch on Saturday--Pros:-Open kitchen with bar seating-Great old fashioned soda bar (although HIGH prices)-Sides are awesome! Macaroni salad was excellent as well the potato salad. However, sandwiches were just okay. {tried the bacon & turkey on a croissant: messy and standard flavor. Bacon was very overcooked.)-Open atmosphere with large windows and a clean looking space-Inside an old pharmacyCons: -Short staffed on a Saturday during lunch rush, staff seemed very overwhelmed and a lot of the customers were put-off by long waits {no one wants to eat lunch surrounded by grumpy people!}-Culinary items weren't stocked and they were out of a lot of their basic menu ingredients (including mixed greens and one of only two salad dressings they have--the other being ranch!)-Old fashioned sodas, no refills, cost $2.50 (while a Crank Arm Amber beer costs $4.00 on tap)Person Street Pharmacy has been open a couple months now, but they still have a long way to go with they want to maintain regular clients.

2015-11-16,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Casa San Carlo Italian Restaurant,"Craving Italian for dinner, we decided to stay close to home and check out Casa San Carlo after reading so many wonderful reviews.  We arrived pretty early, but after an hour the dining room started to fill up with what seemed like regulars, even on a Monday night. We had checked out the menu online before going, but were happy to see it is just a sample of what is actually offered. The menu is pretty extensive and offers a wide range of chicken,  pasta, seafood, and veal dishes, plus pizza. We ordered the scallop-shrimp-sundried tomatoes special, a stromboli and cheese ravioli with meatballs. The ""specials menu"" is actually a regular menu (it is laminated) but without prices.The scallop-shrimp special (priced at $25.95) had truly jumbo scallops and extra-large shrimp tossed with a really delicate cream sauce.  Overall it was delicious. The Stromboli was spot on, and enormous, we brought half home. The ravioli, served in a bright marinara, could have used a little more filling, but the meatballs were extremely tender and full of flavor.The only issue we all had with the scallops and shrimp dish and ravioli was a lack of cheese. I was surprised by the small shaker of parmesan on the table, like something you'd see at a takeout pizza place, and neither of our dishes were finished with a sweep of fresh grated cheese before serving.The interior is cozy and comfortable, our server was knowledgeable and friendly and the owner circled the dining room like a welcoming host twice during our dinner. And finally, it would be wrong to not mention the bread basket. Casa San Carlo starts you off with a combination of garlic knots, pizza and sliced Italian dripping in olive oil. They are definitely wining at the bread basket."

My husband was actually trying to order delivery when I came in from work but alas, the coupon was not good off of it.It's pretty close to our place, which is a plus, and they're open late on Sunday (late for Sunday, that is, so 10pm). We were seated and ordered pretty quick, and then the waitress came back and said ""the tea isn't ready yet"" - cool, I can wait. No problem.Our food had a little wait, but for the first time in a long time, the orange chicken I ordered at any place wasn't over fried (though WAS a little over sauced). My husband had the chicken and cashew, and though he thought mine was better, he thought his was pretty good too.The tea that wasn't ready ""yet""? Never came, but wasn't charged for it.Now, like another reviewer (as I mentioned before) we had a coupon. I did give it to them after they brought the bill, but it had been sitting on the table in plain view the whole time. This is a big thing for me... they took it off the whole total - that's not right, is it? They're supposed to take it off the subtotal so the tax is adjusted, right?Had husband leave a tip, then we took the dish we ordered so we could use the coupon (though, tea probably would have pushed us over too) and headed home.

Buffet had a nice amount on it but no samosas, nothing spinach based, only one dessert, no rice pudding, no honey cheese dessert balls.  The dessert was some sort of flavorless pudding with a can of fruit mixed in.  YUCK!

2015-11-17,4.0,"Los Angeles, CA",Shish Kabob,"I spent a few days in Raleigh for a conference, and like any good professional on a work trip, I hit the bar way too hard on night one and ended up puking in my room the next morning. After a nap and a panel, in which I was an active participant, I needed some sustenance, bad. I stumbled over to Shish Kabob, which was right outside the hotel, in the lovely City Plaza.The place was small and casual, basically a take-out spot with a few tables outside. It was empty when I went in at three in the afternoon, except for a guy manning the register and grill. He was very nice and helpful. I ordered a Phoenician Platter and a Diet Coke, and it was a decent solution to my problems.The platter came with two kabob skewers and three sides of my choosing, which didn't seem like an inordinate amount of food until I held the container in my hands. It was a large lunch--I got it with chicken and beef kabobs, with sides of rice, tabouli, and hummus with pita. The chicken was tasty, if on the dry side, marinated in a garlic sauce. The beef was also nice and flavorful, with a little bit of toughness. I really liked the fluffy rice and the fresh tabouli, and the hummus and pita were satisfying. I sat alone on a planter in the City Plaza and ate with the top of the styrofoam container flapping back and forth in the breeze--a moment of calm in a busy week. I'd recommend Shish Kabob if you need a quick meal in the area. The kabobs aren't the best you'll ever have, but they should do the trick if you're hungry."
2015-11-17,4.0,"Chesterfield Court House, VA",Humble Pie,"Went here for brunch to celebrate my daughter's birthday. It's a cool restaurant, that has been redone from an old warehouse. The outdoor seating area is very nice, and the inside is very big and open and feels like....a warehouse. Among our group we tried the breakfast burrito, the biscuits and gravy, and the cobelt sandwich. Everyone really liked the food, and their biscuits are awesome. Crunchy, but not from being burned or overcooked. The mimosas were also a big hit. Very simple menu, with just a dozen or so options all on one page. A nice change of pace from the typical chain restaurant approach of having so many options you can't decide. I would definitely try this again."
2015-11-17,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",El Pollo Rico Restaurant,El Salvadorian food at its best as I guess from the flags on the wall. If you like Peruvian Chicken it's almost alike except for the green and white sauces they have Salsa. The ambience is not something to look forward to as tables and chairs in my sons school cafeteria is better. They have a row of refrigerators like in 7/11 filled with beer. A shelf of ingredients that they use covers the kitchen. Don't get me wrong the food is decent. But the ambience is not something to admire. Your better off getting a take out or invite all boys and drink here. As I ate I didn't see a single lady eating because this is not the kind of place to take one. I ordered their Chicken covered with shredded vegetables and Tostones or fried flattened plantain. They are courteous and accommodating.
2015-11-17,4.0,"Huntersville, NC",Mo-Te Vietnamese Restaurant,I've only had the bubble tea here. It was better than at Pho Far East. It was smooth without chunks of ice. The boba was also cooked thoroughly; not hard in the middle.
2015-11-17,1.0,"Cary, NC",42nd Street Oyster Bar & Seafood Grill,"Came to 42nd Street for a special occasion and it was definitely a special experience. We didn't know you had to sit AT the oyster bar to get steamed oysters, so we asked to get seated there which didn't take too long and we were re-accommodated with ease, which was a nice surprise!I was still getting into oysters but am willing to try anything. We were a group of 3 and we only ordered oysters, the half shell selections, the oyster sampler and a  1/2 peck of the steamed oysters. This was definitely plenty of food along with the delicious hush puppies they give you on the house! My favorites were the variety of the half shell raw oysters and the 42nd Street Baked Oyster!Overall - was a great experience and will definitely be back!"
2015-11-17,4.0,"Birds Landing, CA",Anvil’s Cheesesteaks,"I am in Raleigh for business, I live in Oregon.   When I saw a Cheesesteak place on Yelp, I had to try it... Philly cheesesteaks pretty much don't exist in Oregon.   I got in here and couldn't help it... Pastrami called to me.   Sandwich was amazing.   The sauce was delicious, and Melty cheese, generous meat and coleslaw.    Big sandwich, I couldn't finish the whole thing.   I was disappointed with the potato salad, it was a bit bland and had big chunks of potato and smaller chunks that I weren't sure what they were.   Not horrible, I just wouldn't order it again.   Seating space was too small and intimate for my comfort, definitely a take out place for me.    This Oregon girl loved her sandwich!"
2015-11-17,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Players Retreat,This is a Raleigh landmark and great place to eat and catch a game.  Menu is dynamic and offers everything from bar finger food to carefully prepared entrees and seasonal dishes.   Parking can be difficult so be heads up and 10 minutes early.   Go pack go!
2015-11-17,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Wakefield Tavern,"Best wings in the Raleigh area!  Great service, excellent beer selection, and the nachos were yummy.  Also enjoyed the atmosphere - good lighting and noise level.  Some sports bars are too bright and way too loud, but not Wakefield Tavern.  I'll definitely be returning again and again!"
2015-11-17,4.0,"Cary, NC",Mandolin,"We had a wonderful meal at Mandolin last Saturday.  I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could.  At least for us it was one of those meals that you remember fondly.  We had reservations and arrived a little early since it was our first visit and we do not come to this part of town frequently.  It's a shame that there's really nothing of note within walking distance.  The hostess seated us at a nice table by the window (nice, although the only thing to see are the cars going by on fairview).  The waitress was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu, and gave us time to make our selections with leisure.  I had intended to order the Charcuterie plate,  but the waitress made sure that I knew everything that would be on it, since it changes periodically and wanted to check whether I would like it.  I was not crazy about some of the choices, so I switched to the potato  leek soup and my wife had the root vegetable salad.  I loved the soup, and my wife loved the salad.  For the main entree we split the rib-eye, a 35 ounce bone-in delicious cut of beef, cooked and seasoned to perfection (we asked for medium rare and it was, with some verging more on the rare, which is understandable on such a large cut) on a bed of roasted vegetables.  It was delicious and possibly one of the best steaks I've had in recent memory.  We'll probably be coming back just for that.  FYI The waitress mentioned that it is not always available and the sizes vary, depending on the supplier.   For dessert we had the banana pudding.  it was also excellent.  The pudding was a bit runny,  so that may not be to everyone's liking,  but the flavor was great, with lots of fresh banana, meringue and house made nutella with a shortbread-y cookie.  Finished the pudding off with some decaf coffee that was surprisingly satisfying, strong and flavorful.I had mention to the waitress the possibility of bringing in the rest of the family for a round of rib-eyes, and she brought me the card of the event coordinator.  A nice touch. Service was great, food was excellent, we will definitely be coming back"
2015-11-17,5.0,"Houston, TX",Bolt Bistro,I LOVE YALL!!!! That Salmon and Fall Salad made my Night Bolt in Raleigh was amazing the food perfect for the entire party the service was on point!
2015-11-17,4.0,"Durham, NC",Mo-Te Vietnamese Restaurant,"After having pho for the first time the week before, I wanted to try more Vietnamese food. It was a Wednesday and the restaurant I had previously visited was closed. I decided to go to Mo-Te and ordered the grilled shrimp vermicelli and the shrimp spring rolls. It was absolutely delicious!The interior of the store is very simple and somewhat small so it may not be the best seating for groups. But I was ordering take-out so I didn't mind sitting at a table for 2 while my food was being prepared. Also, the lady behind the counter was very nice!  I look forward to go back and try their bubble tea."
2015-11-17,5.0,"Austin, TX",18 Seaboard,"Greeted with amuse by the chef - owner. Incredibly friendly guy, even gave me some fave recommendations for my next visit to Raleigh.  She - crab soup creamy and flavorful. Pork shank fall apart with grits and beautiful jus. Ended with sticky toffee pudding.  Neighborhood feel in the best sense... Homey, yummy, and a good wine list."
2015-11-17,3.0,"Wilmington, NC",Fu Kee Express,This place is awesome.... great food and stellar service. It's a one man show so try to hit it on off hours or be prepared to wait. It is well worth any wait though.
2015-11-17,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Another Broken Egg Cafe,"We've eaten at this place before. But, today it just wasn't as good. We were seated right away. Which was really good. The food was just OK. Nothing fantastic. The server wasn't very attentive. Several times my husband had to wait with an empty glass. And one time there were people at the door waiting to be seated. And they had to go to the bar and ask if they had to sear themselves. It looks like it's time to find another place for breakfast."
2015-11-17,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Oak City Meatball Shoppe,"Yummy!I have been meaning to try this place for awhile. I had heard about it via friends and they all gave positive reviews. The food was delicious and there are so many things to chose from. The menu is pretty simple and easy to navigate. I went with the hoagie because I felt like I could not pass up an opportunity to have a meatball sandwich. I tried the veggie balls and my bf had the sliders. I must say not the best veggie meatball I have every had, the flavor was good/the texture was off (cue the response of why go to a MEATball place and not eat meat). So just a perspective if you are a vegetarian. The serving sizes are pretty big so either come with a big appetite or go halfsies with someone. I think the sliders are really where it is at. You can try three different meatballs, sauces, and cheeses (for extra) if you please. Definitely worth a try if you have a hankering for meatballs."
2015-11-17,5.0,"Durham, NC",Soo Café,"You need to come here and try the Korean Fried Chicken, the better KFC, unless you want to miss out on some of the best fried chicken in the area.  I finally made it out here to quell a insatiable craving for Korean food and ended up loving the place.  It's a nice restaurant, but it is in a sorta run down strip mall.  For me that's kinda what makes this place so awesome, call it charm or whatever you want, this place is just great and they have K-Pop perpetually playing on a TV in the corner to get you in the Korean State of Mind.       Everything I had here was great and a bargain compared to other Korean places in the area.  Soo Cafe is more of a à la cart place and doesn't offer Banchan with all dishes.  You can however get sides of Kimchi and Pickled Diakon for a couple of bucks and they are both top notch.  The Vegetable Tempura is excellent and just like other yelpers say the mushrooms are the best part of the dish, and I'm not even a fan of mushrooms.       The fried chicken is where it's at though, absolutely some of the best fried chicken I've ever had.  I got the Half Chicken in SOGA sauce and it was incredible.  Even though the Chicken was tossed in sauce it was the crispiest fried chicken I've ever had.  Biting into it was very audible and delicious.   I'd recommend you give it a minute or two to cool off a bit though because it comes out super hot.  I also appreciated the fact that they chopped the chicken breast into segments and left the liver in place...fried to perfection.  The Chicken was huge, the wings and drumstick were some of the biggest I've ever seen.       The SOGA sauce is perfectly balanced and gets better and better the more you eat.  Even though it's a soy garlic sauce there are a lot more flavors involved, ginger and several other sweet spices are present.  It's just a great all around messy meal.       I also love the rules/guidelines they have first on their menus.  I thought it was funny they have to say to get your chicken without any sauce if your sensitive to spicy food, because I didn't think the SOGA was spicy at all.  Based on the other rules there are way to many picky people eating here.  There is nothing wrong with trying something different or outside your comfort zone...you never know you might like it.  Anyway everything I had here was awesome and I think the quality of the food for the price is phenomenal.  The service was great too!  I was personally impressed that one server was able to hold down more than a half dozen tables and take care of to-go orders, as that is much harder to do than you'd think.  I really enjoyed myself here and think you should absolutely give this place a try."
2015-11-17,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Poole’s Downtown Diner,I'd go just for a beer and Mac n cheese. If you're not a simple minded Neanderthal like myself then you should try the rest of the menu. I can tell you that the rabbit confit pot pie was damn good. But if you're only in town for a night and you're at Pooles make sure you at least get the damn Mac n cheese and a local beer. Do it please.
2015-11-17,2.0,"Moraga, CA",Another Broken Egg Cafe,"The breakfast was OK.  I have had better.  The potaoes looked and tasted like they were shaken out of a Costco frozen food bag.  The potions were OK, but everything was so plain and lacked character."
2015-11-17,5.0,"Cary, NC",Gravy,All I can say is kale Caesar salad. The best! And we sat at the bar for the second time. Our bartender remembered us from a month ago. Down to the wine and cheese that we ordered! Crosby is the best!
2015-11-17,4.0,"Davidson, NC",The Fiction Kitchen,"This was a good restaurant.  The food is high-quality, very local, and nicely prepared.  The vegan take on meat is interesting, if not totally successful, at least for an omnivore.  Tofu bacon takes some familiarization, I guess.  It's a big, young, noisy place with a small wait at the Sunday brunch we attended.  Staff very peaceful, patient, and friendly.   Prices weren't bad.  If it were local, I'd go frequently.  Definitely worth a try if you're passing through Raleigh, and looking for slightly strange."
2015-11-17,3.0,"Berwyn, IL",Big Ed’s City Market Restaurant,"So...I'm from out of town and by the time I got my 18 month old and myself ready for the day, breakfast time was over at my hotel. The concierge pointed us towards Big Eds! Sure, I got lost (thanks for sending me on a frustrating journey filled with pointless turns, google maps) but thanks to some kind locals, I found this hidden (literally tucked into a back street) gem! My little lady and I were seated promptly, given drinks just as fast, and of course, she starts to cry and was on the verge of a tantrum. Suddenly one of the servers (not even our server) appears outta nowhere and completely stops the tantrum dead in its tracks with southern charm! I kid you not, my kid forgot she was about to have a meltdown and all was right again! Then, as if she knew it was her favorite, our server offered to bring my baby some apple sauce, which came with a biscuit!I ordered coffee, smoked sausage, eggs, biscuits, and fruit and it was out so quickly (which is great when you're sharing food with a hungry baby.) My bill came out to 8.95 (for ALL of that food, can you believe it?!) They kept my coffee and water cups full and were so incredibly sweet and friendly.  I can't wait to go back before we head home!"
2015-11-17,3.0,"Wilmette, IL",Second Empire Restaurant And Tavern,Omg! Wonderful meal! Food was superb. Every course a complex mix of wonderful flavors. Best dinner we have had in RDU area. Service was attentive yet unobtrusive.A perfect restaurant for a special night out.
2015-11-17,4.0,"Knightdale, NC",First Watch,I ate at First Watch for the first time with my mom and 1 year old son a few weeks ago. The service was great and the food was delicious. The server was very friendly and attentive. The serving sizes are very generous. You definitely get your money's worth and will not leave hungry. The only thing I wish was different about First Watch is that it was open longer.
2015-11-17,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sitti,"Where to begin....the service was awesome, the pita bread is the best I have ever had, not to mention the beautiful ambiance. Very recommended. Great place for a romantic date night."
2015-11-17,5.0,"Charlotte, NC",Sitti,"One of my absolute favorite restaurants in Raleigh! I stop by every time I visit the city. I order the Chicken Shawarma plate, comes with chicken, rice (only lunch), pickles, onions, garlic whip, pita bread, and I add a side of mozzarella cheese. Everything tastes just right! The service has always been great to me as well. The restaurant is decorated very elegant, Lebanese style. Great place to come with friends or family!"
2015-11-17,4.0,"Moraga, CA",Beasley’s Chicken & Honey,Great spot!  This place has a unique atmosphere with lots of character.  The food was interesting unique and very well prepared.  The bar only serves American made spirits which made it all that much more appealing.  Great food!
2015-11-18,4.0,"New York, NY",Sawasdee Thai Restaurant,"Went here based on the reviews. This place gives smallish portions for a highish price which is why u took off two stars. Despite this the food was decent as well as the service. Don't get the satay chicken its expensive, small and not very good. :("
2015-11-18,4.0,"Alexandria, VA",Clockwork,"This place was full of wannabe's. The thirst was real when we walked in on Saturday night. PACKED. TO. THE. GILLS. Strike 1. We normally would turn right around and walk out but I had heard how cool this place was so I remained open minded. It had all your usual, thirsty types: girls in hooker boots and mini skirts on a freezing Saturday night, ugly guys with money blowing cash on glasses of champs for girls who will never sleep with them, and, without sounding crass, lots of foreigners. I don't know how else to say that, really. We ordered a couple vodka sodas and the bartender measured my bf's vodka and shorted him pretty majorly. Strike 2. At this point, we decided this isn't our scene. Maybe it's because we were here so late and all the class had left the building, I don't know, but it just seemed lame. We waited and waited and waited for the bartender to close us out but he was so swamped and uninterested, we just left. Strike 3. Not our scene. Pass."
2015-11-18,3.0,"Atlanta, GA",Tacos Y Mariscos Vallarta,My friend's this is a hidden jewel!!! The waiters were really friendly and attentive. The quality of the food outstanding! Plus the size of the plates good Lord huge for a very cheap price! And the drinks are awesome! Definitely give it a try!!!
2015-11-18,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Neomonde Bakery & Deli,"Such a good place for lunch! Its always consistent. I get the choice of 4. Hummus, tabouli, tuna salad, and falafel. Its healthy, quick, and delicious."
2015-11-18,5.0,"Berwyn, IL",The Remedy Diner,"I was wandering around with my daughter looking for a place to have soup and a sandwich and I'm glad I chose The Remedy. I really enjoyed the vibe of this place! It was super laidback, great music playing, and a little on the hipster side, but I dig it. After perusing the menu, I asked what kind of soup they had (for my kiddo) and our server offered a sample. I thought that was a nice touch. (It was a delicious quinoa chili, by the way!) For a sandwich, I ordered probably one of the best sandwiches I've ever had, the Sgt. Billy Club. The bread was perfectly toasted, and all of the flavors came together beautifully. I was also happy that they had Coke products here because North Carolina seems to love their Pepsi. What's up with that? ;) The staff was friendly, and displayed the perfect amount of attentiveness at just the right times. My one regret is not saving room for the homemade desserts. Key lime pie, you'll always be the one that got away :( I will definitely visit again when I come back to NC!"
2015-11-18,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Garland,"This may have been one of the most disappointing dining experiences I've ever had in a food joint in downtown Raleigh; we were a part of 9 so we had the chance to sample a big part of the menu, the ONLY good thing we had was the hummus, it was delicious! But everything else we ordered was bad, tasteless and super greasy: the corn cakes, soggy, bland and tasteless; pork bowl was super greasy, rice raw and undercooked; pakoras again greasy, weirdly presented and tiny. They served the wrong entree to my dad who ordered a vegetarian dish and got full pork on it and after a very unpleasant, heavy and discussing meal, the price tag showed $290 and $58 for the tip......are you F***ing kidding me?? I have never paid that outrageous amount for a tip, even in NYC and I a great restaurant!! So 6x entrees, 4 appetizers and a bottle of meh wine $290?? Will NEVER go back to this ugly place again, I would have had better food at the Subway on the corner (which is pretty disgusting as well) for $7 bucks tops and I would have been happier, fuller and with extra cash to go to 6-7 better places around. Never again."
2015-11-18,5.0,"Durham, NC",Kai Sushi and Sake Bar,"Now I am by no means a sushi expert, but I don't know how you can do much better than Kai!They have a bunch of unique and varied rolls, all the ingredients they use are clearly fresh, and you simply cannot beat the specials of 3 rolls for $23.99 or 5 rolls for $36.99. Also, unlike other sushi restaurants, their specials include any of the rolls on their menu (including the special rolls for the day). Speaking of the sushi itself, my personal favorites were the Darth Vader (love me some black rice!) and the Punk Rock rolls. Did I mention you get some free edamame with your meal? The interior of the restaurant has attractive lighting with big wooden high tops and low tops to sit at. It feels a bit cozy, which is a good thing. The service is fast and the staff is very friendly. What else could you ask for?"
2015-11-18,5.0,"Alexandria, VA",Stanbury,"We had planned on going somewhere else for dinner but it was closed for a private event, so we trekked up to Stanbury and hoped for a table. It is definitely out of the way and away from other restaurants on the main drag but don't let that deter you; this is a hip, excellent foodie restaurant. We arrived around 8:45 on Saturday night and there were no tables so we sat at the bar, which was fine because it was a nice bar. I started out with something that had tequila and rosemary and a fresh rosemary sprig. Nice touch. We ordered a couple small plates: beef tartare & the grilled romaine. Great choices! While I have had better, more flavorful beef tartare, it was surrounded in a couple different sauces that really took the flavors of the beef to the next level. I've never seen a beef tartare served with sauces or with a rye, which was an interesting choice, but it really was a great starter plate. The grilled romaine may not sound like much, but if you haven't tried something like this, you're missing out. The char on the lettuce combined with the large, soft croutons and the house-made cesar dressing created amazing flavor profiles in my mouth! Do not miss the grilled romaine!We both ordered the ribeye, which I typically hate to do, but we both wanted steaks, what can I say? I ordered it M, my bf ordered it MR. Go with MR, for sure. Ribeyes are my go-to at nice places and this ribeye did not disappoint. It had a nice sear to it and it had this tasty pesto-like sauce on it that, I think was Mexican-based, but oddly it paired very nicely with the ribeye. The mushrooms were marinated in something excellent, they also paired great with the steak and the potatoes were crispy and brown. One of the top 5 steaks of my life. We paired the steaks with a bottle of red (Grenache), at the recommendation of the bartender, and it went very well. Also, for having such an amazing, upscale menu, it was surprisingly low-key inside. Not stuffy at all. Great music. Chill staff. Dim-lighting. Rustic ambiance. AMAZING food. I am going on record as saying this meal at Stanbury was one of the top 3 best meals of my LIFE."
2015-11-18,4.0,"Charlotte, NC",Lynnwood Grill & Brewing Concern,TIFFANY IS THE BEST BARTENDER EVER! They have grown into a brewery and offer many of their beers year round. The cheeseburger pizza is off the chain! And the rooftop bar is amazing if the weather is right!! I've always had an amazing time at this bar!
2015-11-18,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Big Ed’s North,"Big Ed's is all about huge portions of comfort food.  We went during the week and it was busy, the place definitely has an established following.We both ordered a single pancake, one with bacon, the other with turkey sausage and an egg on the side. The pancake was cake- like and as big as a large dinner plate. It had a lightly, caramelized crunchy coating on it, I wonder if they sprinkle sugar on it while it's cooking? Even though it was delicious, we each ate less than half of our pancake; it's just too much food.Our waitress was friendly and attentive and the space is cozy and comfortable. This was our first time, so we were confused by the fact that we each got a separate check, and then how to pay our bill. I put a card on top of the two checks and our waitress kept walking by without saying anything. After a while we figured out that there is a cashier at the door.  We'll go back, when were' craving that big breakfast, but given the crowd for an off-time on a Wednesday, I can only imagine how busy it gets on the weekends."
2015-11-18,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Big Ed’s North,Great little country breakfast with a super friendly staff. Eggs were cooked perfectly and the spice in the sausage was just right. We will be back.
2015-11-18,5.0,"Durham, NC",MachuPicchu Peruvian Cuisine,This place is a gem! Tucked away in an unassuming strip mall next to a beauty supply store the only hint that this place might be special is the sign on the door advising reservations. This is definitely true and not hype. The patrons just kept rolling in. The dishes are subtle with a very layered tasting experience that makes use of all parts of the palate. Once again too full for desert. Great value
2015-11-18,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chuck’s,"Best Burgers in Raleigh...there are only 1-2 other places that could possibly compete, but they also cost 3-5x more.  All of Ashley Christensen's restaurants are amazing in my opinion.  If anyone is giving her less than 4-5 stars, it's probably not her/the restaurant's fault.  Read a review very carefully and try it out for yourself.  I also highly recommend Poole's Diner for Brunch."
2015-11-18,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gravy,"Nice environment. Good food. Good service. Jesse, the bartender did a great job! Will be back."
2015-11-18,5.0,"Berwyn, IL",Centro,"This awesome little joint reminds me so much of the Pilsen area back in Chicago. The staff was so nice from the host, to the server and the manager.  Before our server (Cecilia) even greeted us, she went to bring us all waters, including a little cup with a lid for our little one. I LOVED that we didn't even have to ask her for that. She was very sweet!I ordered a margarita and my husband a caipirinha. My margarita was DEEEEELICIOUS. My husband's drink was good, but needed just a touch more of lime. For dinner, I ordered the ribeye steak and he ordered the chile sureño (poblano pepper stuffed with cheese grits, mushrooms, shrimp and a stellar chile ancho sauce.) My ribeye was good (a little on the fatty side.) I loved the kale side that came with my dish, it kind of made the flavor of the steak pop. I kicked myself when I tried my husbands dish, though. It was definitely the better choice between the two! I would definitely return for the chile sureño and another margarita (or two or three.)  The food is well prepared and overall, we had a very positive dining experience! We left full and happy. Thanks, Centro!"
2015-11-18,5.0,"Cary, NC",Chuck’s,"I am a fan of the restaurants who stick to one thing and do it really, really well.  Chuck's does burgers really, really well.  We chose to go on a weeknight when we hoped it wouldn't be crowded.  Score.  Our server Savannah was very helpful and friendly.  The burgers aren't the huge burgers you get at some chain restaurants.  But what you do get is a top quality burger with awesome toppings.  Sure you can add to the burgers if you want.  But why?  They have a great selection.  The fries are as good as everyone says....especially because of the sauce.  But as one friend said, onion rings would have made the meal even better.  Overall, AC knows how to do it right."
2015-11-18,3.0,"Alexandria, VA",Busy Bee Cafe,"Man, we should have came here for brunch. Rooftop seating! And it had the casual, open, atmosphere we were looking for, as well as a house-DJ playing great beats. We came here for a small bite and a drink before we got on the road since you can't start drinking until NOON in North Carolina on Sundays. Tragedy. We sat up on the roof which was a great choice. We both ordered bloodys, which we soon discovered was a bloody mix. Boo. They have a nice menu though; I ordered the fried-green tomatoes and my bf ordered the chicken salad. My tomatoes were fine, nicely breaded but the pimento it was served with was overwhelming and COVERED the tomatoes. Too much. My bf's chicken salad was flavorful and delicious, wish I would have gotten that. The fries were flavorful and browned, but WAY too soggy. Ruined it. Service was a little weird too. I don't know if it's just these hipsters or what, but we experienced very off-putting, aloof service pretty much the whole time we were in Raleigh. Just a small observation. Overall, pretty good food, great brunch vibe and rooftop for drinks."
2015-11-18,3.0,"Wake Forest, NC",Godavari Indian Restaurant,"The food is always top notch. The spice level is great for me, the spicier the better. The restaurant has a great selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian items. There is something for everyone. The place is clean and well maintained, there is obvious pride in the food and surroundings."
2015-11-18,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Coquette Brasserie,"The dish might not look promising (it kinda looked like a huge slice of pie) but don't let looks fool you...the quiche lorraine was heavenly! The egg was smooth and silky with small bits of bacon and onion for added flavor/texture, and the crust was perfectly crispy. The side salad was also a delicious and refreshing touch and helped balance out the whole meal.This place is always packed for brunch, so make reservations if you can. The decor is beautiful and classy without being overly upscale, so it's a great place to catch up with a friend or even have a nice date night during their dinner hours."
2015-11-18,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tupelo Honey Cafe Raleigh,"The Tupelo to my Honey.I first tried this gem in Asheville, NC while on a girl's trip. So naturally I have fond memories shared over mimosas and warm biscuits/jam.  When I found out Tupelo Honey was opening a location in Raleigh's Cameron Village I couldn't have been more excited. Due to my love of brunch I have yet to try another meal at Tupelo, but based on their brunch performance I am sure every other meal is spot on as well. Your meal will start with warm homemade biscuits and jam, which alone could keep me coming back. My favorite brunch item on the menu is the Super Southern Breakfast Bowl. The combo of black-eyed peas, DELICIOUS cheesy grits, eggs, bacon, and more cheese is to die for. Also, If you have a sweet tooth I would recommend at least splitting a sweet potato pancake."
2015-11-18,5.0,"Cary, NC",Mitch’s Tavern,I love this place. Quality food and a great relaxing atmosphere for a reasonable price. It's hard for vegetarians to find a good pub to eat/drink beer at and this place nails it. The food is always fresh and made to order and more than what you were expecting.
2015-11-18,4.0,"Alexandria, VA",Clouds Brewing,"We came in from out of town and wanted to find some chill places next to our hotel in Glenwood South. FYI, to people not from Raleigh, Glenwood South is NOT the downtown main-drag everyone goes out in. We found that out the hard way. Apparently the main drag is on Fayetteville Street and THAT'S where all the cool bars and clubs are. Moving on...Clouds is a little in the middle of nowhere in the Warehouse District, but it was a welcome site. Soon as we walked in, it was very lively and bustling. Good classic rock music playing. Amazing, selection of craft beers, sorted by types and styles of brewing. The bartender helped me out with a nice, espresso-flavored stout that I really enjoyed and my bf's beer (the Nitro) was just as smooth and strong. They have a few bar bites as well, including a nice Bavarian pretzel served with a spicy mustard. Mmmmm. If we weren't headed to dinner, we would have carbed out. Overall, we really enjoyed the lively, hip atmosphere here, the cool décor and the selective beers on tap. My bf made a note about the service being a little...aloof, if that's the word we want to use. But I think it's just that hipster air. Great bar/micro-brewery in Raleigh!"
2015-11-18,5.0,"Los Angeles, CA",Sitti,"It took some effort to get a table at Sitti. I tried to go with a party of five on a Friday night, only to turn back around when faced with a 90-minute wait time. We then tried to make a reservation for Saturday night, but found it was booked at all reasonable hours. I was finally able to grab a table for three by calling ahead and cajoling the hostess into putting my name down--she took pity on us out-of-towners.The restaurant was nice, with lovely ambiance and an upscale but unfussy feel. I came with two girlfriends, but couldn't help thinking it would make a great date spot. (It was also great for dinner with girlfriends.) We got a high table near the front, a bit small for the amount of food we ordered but otherwise comfortable. Service was good, and I enjoyed a drink with my dinner called Jalapeño Business--A+ for deliciousness and perfectly groan-worthy pun name. It was a tequila drink made with fresh lemon juice, jalapeño-infused simple syrup, shredded ginger, and fresh cilantro, zesty and spicy and easy to put away.The food was solid. We shared a few mezze and a mixed grill, and it was all quite tasty and satisfying. The halloumi was great. Hard to go wrong with seared salty cheese, this one topped with dates, diced tomatoes, roasted almonds, olive oil, and fresh thyme--basically a salad with the right proportions. The hummus was excellent, nutty and savory, the chickpea purée whipped with tahini, garlic, and lemon juice. I also loved the mouhamra, a mezze of roasted red peppers and walnut purée mixed with spices and pomegranate molasses, then finished with extra virgin olive oil. So many wonderful flavors. Both of the dips were best taken with Sitti's fluffy, fresh, hot pita. The mixed grill was less interesting than the appetizers, but still very enjoyable. It came with an assortment of chicken, kafta, and beef kabobs, with a side of basmati rice (we subbed this for the Sitti rice, due to an allergy). The kafta was my favorite, the ground beef and lamb kabob just bursting with flavor. The chicken and beef were good, too, just less memorable.I've been on a bit of a Middle Eastern food kick in the last year, and while I've had better kabobs and mezze in that time, I was pretty impressed with Sitti. The atmosphere was great, and the food well worth seeking out. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for Lebanese food, or just a nice, hearty meal in Raleigh."
2015-11-18,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chuy’s,"Let me explain how your next happy hour is going to go down. 1. You're going to arrive at Chuy's before 7pm so you can take advantage of their -INSANE- complementary chip bar. 2. Once you sit down, order a margarita (or two). 3. Head to said chip bar and load up a basket of homemade, extra thin, extra crispy tortilla chips and smother them with as much queso sauce, salsa, refried beans, and ground beef as your heart desires. 4. Try to detach yourself from your chips long enough to order a meal (I recommend the chicken flautas or tex mex enchiladas to max out on all the best flavor. 5. Indulge. 6. But ... don't indulge too much because you absolutely can't leave Chuy's without a piece of their massive tres leches cake. Chuy's is decadent. It's delicious. It's an easy answer when you don't know where to go for happy hour. It also happens to have plenty of comfortable outside seating overlooking the North Hills park and event space. You're welcome."
2015-11-18,5.0,"Los Angeles, CA",Joule Coffee,"I got brunch at Joule Coffee with a friend from Brooklyn during a conference weekend in Raleigh. We both admitted that when traveling, we were strongly drawn to the most hipster New York/L.A.-type spots we could find in any given city, and our meal at Joule was the natural result of our predilections.Joule is apparently part of a cool, trendy restaurant group helmed by Ashley Christensen, a James Beard Award-winning restaurateur who's made it her mission to revitalize the dining scene in downtown Raleigh. We walked in at around noon on a rainy Saturday and faced a short but manageable wait. The place was charming, casually pretty with sleek wood surfaces and a turquoise accent wall. Counter seating wrapped around the entrance, creating a constant window display of people with coffee and laptops. The vibe was cheerful and easy, definitely more coffee shop in atmosphere, despite the table service, the full bar, and the serious menu. Service was great, smooth and attentive.I skipped the coffee and got a Bloody Mary, which was excellent, just the kick I needed to start my day (hey, I was on California time). For my brunch, I ordered the Carolina shrimp and grits, and this was the best thing I ate in Raleigh. The shrimp was supple, snappy, and beautifully flavored, cooked with smoked tomatoes, scallions, mushrooms, and sherry. This all came piled onto a bed of creamy, nutty coarse-ground grits, creating a smokey, mouthwateringly flavorful sauce that dripped right into them. I wiped that plate clean and could've eaten plenty more.It might be a while before I'm back in Raleigh, but I'll head straight back to Joule and check out Ashley Christensen's other restaurants on any future visits. I had a lovely brunch here and would gladly repeat it--I'd be a regular if I lived in town."
2015-11-18,4.0,"Hampstead, NC",Standard Foods,We had amazing lunch at Standard Foods.  Love the portion size-we tried many different dishes and all of them were delicious.  Both the butternut squash and apple soup were some of the best I've ever had.  The radicchio salad was perfectly balanced.  The desserts were equally as good.  Don't miss this place!
2015-11-18,5.0,"Alexandria, VA",Joule Coffee,"We came to Joule from a recommendation from a foodie friend and right when we walked in, I could see why. Full of gourmet coffees and lattes, I was in heaven! And also severely hungover. It was very busy, loud, and bustling in here. We waited about 15 minutes to be seated for brunch. Coffee took awhile to come out and finally did once we were seated in the bizarre, enclosed window box seating. Allow me to explain these ""boxes"": they are hot, protruding boxes made of glass and you sit on stools and there is zero ventilation while you stare at the other diners sitting directly across from you. Very warm and stifling in there. I am warning you: if you're hungover, DO NOT SIT IN THESE CLAUSTROPHOBIC TRAPS. I literally had to ""mind over matter"" it while sitting here to keep from freaking out. I literally couldn't breathe. I had to step outside at one point to gasp for air. And I'm not claustrophobic! Basically, just wait for a table in the main dining room instead of sitting in these strange glass boxes. The seating situation aside, the food was great! I ordered the BLT and my bf ordered the eggs benny. BLT had great texture, smoky bacon, and guacamole. Mmmm. One huge fail, which I guess is not the restaurant's fault, is that they don't serve drinks until noon?! WHAT?! Apparently this is some law in North Carolina on Sundays. What a joke. I was in desperate need of a bloody so after brunch we basically walked around until I could get one. Overall, nice choice coffee here, great food, but the atmosphere and service were just off for us. I need a chill environment (and ventilation) for a hungover brunch."
2015-11-18,3.0,"Pawleys Island, SC",Joule Coffee,"I had a salad and my sister had huevos rancheros. Both equally awesome! The place was crowded on a Thursday late morning, so seems like it's a great hangout spot. The ambiance is really chill and the decor is great!We sat at the bar and started our order with two lattes - both delicious. . . I even ordered another one to go. The wait staff was friendly and the food was delivered fresh and quickly. I will definitely go back when in Raleigh again."
2015-11-18,5.0,"Reno, NV",Nashers Sandwich House,"This place is a true hidden gem.  I almost didn't post a review, as I want to keep Nasher's to myself.  The homemade corn chowder was amazing, smooth and very flavorful.  It was topped with a spoonful of crab meat.  This paired very well with the mixed greens salad, topped with a fresh, warm crab cake.  The salad dressing was a sweet vingerette, mixed with a chutney-like smattering of chopped pineapple, cucumber and sweet red peppers.  Do not let the exterior or the seating area fool you, as I would sit on a rock to be able to enjoy the food.  What seems so unpretentious is not to be passed up and the food can easily compete with any 5 star restaurant, with cloth napkins and a string quartet playing in the background.  After all, isn't it the food you really come for, and Nasher's really delivers the goods."
2015-11-19,4.0,"Miami, FL",Tenko Japan,I only had the miso soup and the sushi. Neither was good. There are basic standards for sushi and this didn't meet basic standard.
2015-11-19,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Los Cuates,"Very friendly.  Clean.. Always some good soccer on the tv.Everything on the menu is the very best and I've had everything at least once.There is a very bright green salsa at the bar - be careful - it's really hot, but addictive.Great and very friendly service.My favorite.It's all about the food at Los Cuates."
2015-11-19,4.0,"Cary, NC",J Betski’s,"J. Betski's is a German and Polish and then a touch of modern fusion mixed in. You absolutely have to order the pierogi and they were the best part of the meal. They were filled with pumpkin and cheese and so good we had to order another plate for the table. The restaurant is located in Seaboard and is rather small compared to other spaces in the area. The mirror in the back adds an optical illusion so it looks a bit bigger than it actually is. We made a reservation for 4 on Opentable and waited just a few minutes for our table. The tables are cozy and very close together. The bread and butter at the beginning of the meal took me back to Germany and it was truly authentic bread. I had a special seasonal salad and it was fabulous. The salad had Austrian Speck (similar to prosciutto), almonds, strawberries and gorgonzola.  I ordered the schnitzel and it is presented on a modern triangular plate. The presentation was nice and the breading on the schnitzel was a bit different than other ones I have had. We also had to get the Kaesespaetzle and they are a good side. There was a loud and obnoxious  group of people dining when we were there and it distracted from the meal because it was really hard to hear the conversation. Other than the noise level, the food was delicious from start to finish.  Some of the dishes on the menu were more on the exotic side. The fish of the day for example had shitake mushrooms, ginger and carrot puree and other vegetable and was not German or Polish at all. There is a nice variety where you can get your traditional Bratwurst and Schnitzel and Pierogi and then have a more modern meal. The menu is very balanced."
2015-11-19,4.0,"Land O' Lakes, FL",Despina’s Cafe,"Stopped by this café yesterday for lunch after reading positive reviews on Yelp. Spoke with the owner herself about the food options. Very lovely lady who is kind and generous. Ordered the chicken salad and it was awesome. I would order it again!! They had many tasty desserts. As I'm gluten-free, I couldn't eat any at the time. Although they were making a chocolate mousse gluten-free pie when  I was there. I will stop by again to taste this treat!"

2015-11-19,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Godavari Indian Restaurant,I think place was okay....definitely lot more crowded and not really a kid friendly one. Food was fine ..
2015-11-19,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Irregardless Cafe & Catering,"Maybe I ordered the wrong thing or maybe it was an off night, but I felt like the meal was lackluster and overhyped. The kimchi chips appetizer were interesting but barely spicy with no kimchi flavor, and the sheperd's pie was in dire need of more seasoning. The pie did have a generous amount of vegetables, which I appreciated, but just felt like vegetables mixed together into a basic casserole. I did enjoy the live jazz music though!! It's always great to see restaurants supporting local artists, and the music made the atmosphere fun and relaxed."
2015-11-19,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Firebirds Wood Fired Grill,I love Firebirds!  They have the best BLT salad anywhere and I love their buffalo wings.  Staff is always friendly and pleasurable when I visit.  One of my favorite go to spots for take out if time doesn't permit for me to eat in!
2015-11-19,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Flying Burrito,"This place is awesome!!! Great food and great quality for affordable prices. When in doubt, try anything with pulled pork and queso or of course the outer banks taco! They bring on awesome vibes as soon as you walk into the place! Cool music, cool staff, excellent food! Highly recommend coming here if you never have before! Always keeping up with their variety in draft beers and creating unique food specials every week! This place rocks my socks off :-)"
2015-11-19,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bella Monica,"I visited Bella Monica for my 29th birthday. The staff and food was excellent. I did not know that it was ideal to make reservations, especially on a Wednesday, but it is. When we arrived there was no seating available, I then made a reservation for their next availability ( It was an hour wait). We went and had a few drinks and returned. I ordered the lasagna and my friend ordered the salmon and salad (forgot which one). I can say both items were delicious."
2015-11-19,5.0,"Los Angeles, CA",Rye Bar & Southern Kitchen,"I spent three nights at the Marriott in Raleigh for a mystery writers' conference, and spent about as much time bumming around Rye as I did in my hotel room. It was a perfect conference/hotel bar, always convenient, with great things to drink.The space was big and comfortable, with plenty of seating at and near the bar, as well as in back in a sort of lounge/dining area. The atmosphere was laid back but not bland. Decor was nice, and bartenders well dressed. Service was excellent. I must've had about twenty separate interactions with bartenders throughout the weekend, and all of them were pleasant and easy.The drinks were pretty great. There was a solid selection of cocktails, beers, and wines at reasonable prices (though my expectations might be skewed there, coming from L.A.). I kept coming back to the Southern Mary, a strong variation on a Bloody Mary made with Howling Moon original moonshine, house Mary mix, and barbecue bitters, garnished with pickled okra, baby corn, and candied bacon. This was a real treat, not shy on the moonshine, but balanced with spice and tomato and of course, that lovely sugary bacon. One night they were out of the bacon and I had a normal Bloody Mary, and that was fine but not the same. (To my dismay, I learned that someone else got a Bloody Mary free because they were out of the Southern Mary--I should work on that pout.) I also enjoyed the Watermelon Crawl, a sweet and spicy tequila drink with watermelon, cilantro simple syrup, lime juice, honey, and jalapeño. For a bit of whiskey, I liked the Barrel Aged Manhattan, a smooth drink of rye, sweet vermouth, and Angostura bitters, aged in a charred oak barrel. When I was in more of a beer mood, I took advantage of the tap selection, which seemed pretty decent. I don't remember all the beers I had, but I definitely had a couple 23 oz. Rickshaw Rye IPAs. I know this because they were the death of me one night.Rye is also a restaurant, and though I didn't eat a full meal here, I did have a ""light supper"" of Carolina pulled pork at the bar when I checked into the hotel. This was a great dish, with juicy smoked pork on two slices of buttery, crumbly Southern-style biscuit, served with a side of tasty shoestring fries. It wasn't big, but it did the trick (or did it? I did have an extreme hangover the next day). If I weren't drinking here constantly, I might have liked to have a full meal at Rye. I'll bet the rest of the food's good, too.I had a great time hanging out at Rye for a few days and nights, and would almost recommend the whole hotel for the quality of its bar. It was a wonderful home base for a writers' conference--it kept us all good and social, with space to congregate and plenty to drink."
2015-11-19,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gonza Tacos Y Tequila,"WOW I am so impressed by Gonza! Newly opened in the bottom of the Aloft Hotel on Hillsborough St, this restaurant is gorgeous and they really nailed it with the menu. The space is warm, inviting and beautifully decorated - looks they they are set up for larger parties and small groups. We did not make a reservation, so on Wednesday around 6pm, we opted to sit at the bar, so I can't say much for service beyond the bartenders - who were great.We went with a classic margarita and some type of pineapple jalapeno deal - both were delicious and well made. I ordered the queso as a starter, which was good but the least impressive element of the meal - just kind of standard white queso. Great with the fresh salsa and chips they bring you. My lady date went for the carnitas tacos with a mix of rice and beans for the side. These were so good I did a to-go order of them to take to my husband. Great portion size. I went with the ""Mexican Flag"", which was 3 enchiladas (chicken, steak and beans) smothered in Mexican cream, tomatillo sauce and chile de arbol sauce to make up the colors of the Mexican flag. I have not be so impressed with a meal in so long. Every bite was so flavorful and different from the rest, I could not stop eating. I am in love with this dish and scheming on when I can get back there - I know I won't be able to order anything else!"
2015-11-19,4.0,"Clay, NY",Trophy Brewing Company,Ate here on a Thursday evening- plenty of outdoor seating. Emphasis on specialty pizzas and craft brews. Very difficult to chose but we were very pleased with our selections. Ordered a Perfect Attendance (American Porter) which was very smooth with a hint of nuttiness. Most Loyal was our pizza choice. Good all around. Service was timely. Heard this place rocks on the weekends and during Nearby NC State campus events. Would visit again.
2015-11-19,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar - Seaboard,"Hands down, some of the best burgers in the Triangle! The burgers here are huge delicious messes (yes, expect to use a LOT of napkins), and the non-burgers are just as juicy and tasty. My friend had the bacon cheeseburger on steroids and it was a serious flavor explosion...you could just see his eyes light up as he took his first bite! I was feeling chicken so I ordered the Emilio's Chicken Sandwich and was not disappointed - the buttermilk fried chicken was crispy fried on the outside but soooo very tender on the inside, and the guac/jalapeno bacon/mozzarella toppings were perfect complements!I'll definitely be back to try more flavors. Don't forget to unlock your yelp check-in offer for the free chips appetizer!"
2015-11-20,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Vivace,"In Italian, Vivace means liveliness and levity, so it's only fitting that the restaurant incorporates both those elements. The buoyant bar scene and vivacious dining area make for a popular favorite among those young, urban professionals who want to see and be seen out and about North Hills. The food delivers ultra fresh Italian favorites with a refreshing modern edge. The caprese salad gets an update with seasoned tomatoes, the brussels are loaded with prosciutto and a savory balsamic kick, and the the cheese plate will leave you dreaming about truffles. And that's just the shared plate menu! It's a perfect spot for apres works cocktails and apps with friends or coworkers, but because the scene is as satisfying as the menu, make sure to get there early or opt for a reservation if you want a guaranteed table."
2015-11-20,5.0,"Staten Island, NY",Poppyseed Market,"Awesome place! We had lunch there last week and the sandwiches we ordered were great. The turkey club I had was huge with generous helpings of turkey, bacon and cheese. Definitely worth a return visit soon."
2015-11-20,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Frank’s Pizza & Italian Restaurant,"One of my absolute favorite places to get take out from.  From the past 20 years that I have been patronizing this establishment I probably have only dined in twice.  It is very convenient to my home so I typically pick up my orders.My favorite is the steak and cheese sub.  It is always piled high with meat, cheese and any of the toppings you wish for. The only bad thing I have to say is they are closed for 2 weeks around Christmas time so needless to say I am delighted when they reopen in the New Year!"

2015-11-20,5.0,Greensboro,Calavera Empanadas And Tequila,Very good empanadas. So far the best I had in NC but I am not a connoisseur or running after them. This might change it. The dought taste really good and the fact you can pick each of them with a different filling is really cool. The service was fast and everything very tasty for a very reasonable price.I also loved the 2 sides sauce which combined with your all different empanadas can create a large variety of tastes to try ;)
2015-11-20,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kai Sushi and Sake Bar,"Just had a fabulous lunch date here with my husband.  The sushi was super fresh and ridiculously tasty, the tuna tacos and calamari were fabulous, and the service was superb!!  Decently priced and near my house?  Bonus!  This just became my new go-to spot when the sushi jones hits!"
2015-11-20,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tasty 8’s,The cost is just plain ridiculous! Yea they are good but they are still just hotdogs and are not worth the $8 for 1!!! Dog. I will never come back here at this price again!!
2015-11-20,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Nashers Sandwich House,"What's there to get excited about the lowly sandwich?! Two pieces of bread, some meat slapped in between, pure excitement eh? Well it is pretty exciting if you're doing a sandwich at Nashers up in N. Raleigh. After one visit, color me impressed and pretty durn full to boot. I tracked down Nashers after seeing all the great Yelp reviews and it certainly lived up to expectations. While it doesn't look like much (counter order, spartan dining room), their food is excellent! Especially the sides. I ordered up a chicken parm and we did three sides (mac n cheese, cast iron corn, sweet tater tots). The sandwich was large and on great bread along with melty cheese and pesto spread which was a nice twist. And the mac n cheese was made with ditalini which is pretty unusual but very creamy and delicious. While Nashers may not be much to look at, it rocked it out on my first visit so they are getting a rare five stars! Believe the other Yelp reviews, Nashers is killing it right now. And while it may have a slightly chain feel, from everything I can see, it's a locally run business. So if you're a N. Raleighite, check em out and let them stuff you with some of their great sammiches..."
2015-11-20,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Busy Bee Cafe,This place should really be the last choose around raleigh. They have really poor customer service. I don't recommend busy bee to anyone.
2015-11-20,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Nashers Sandwich House,"Nashers is delicious and creative, but a little bit of a hassle. There's games, like corn hole, set up right outside the front door and one a Saturday afternoon, it made it tough to get in, you had to maneuver around lots of littles running all over the place. Once in we ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich, a crab'wich and a side of mac & cheese.The side of mac & cheese is not to be missed and could almost be a meal in itself. The buffalo chicken had the right amount of sauce- not too hot and was overall delicious. The crab'wich came with a sriracha mayo, which was piled on, I will definitely ask for it on the side next time. Also, not a complaint, but the sandwich was so big that even after cutting it in half; I had to eat it with a fork and knife. Oh, and the crispy Brussel sprout topping was perfection; they should offer it by the bowl.The dining room is modern and fresh. We'll be back, and hopefully by then they have relocated the games."
2015-11-20,5.0,"Garner, NC",Poole’s Downtown Diner,"To me, this is the best special occasion date night place in the city. And it does have to be a special occasion, because to really experience it you won't get out for under $100 with two of you. The mac and cheese is literally a must. You would be stupid to not order it, I don't care how full you think you'll be. The worst thing about Poole's is no reservations, but if there's a will there's a way."
2015-11-20,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Godavari Indian Restaurant,"My husband and I shared the Afghani Chicken Kebab, a portion of Gongura Chicken, Naan, and Phulka.I was very happy with their phulka, and he was happy with the Naan.The Afghani chicken came sizzling, with onions and peppers. It was delicious, and I would definitely go there, just for more of their Tandoori dishes. It wasn't at all like the Afghani kebabs I have had in Delhi, but I guess this is an Andhra iteration, and I like it a lot.The Gongura chicken was not the best I have ever had- it was tasty, and spicy like we had requested, but it was terribly oily, and I'm getting a bit tired of that. Just like all the Andhra restaurants in the area the plate had a delicious but deadly oil slick thing going on.The service was good, their drinks seem a bit over priced, but the little we tried of their food was good and excellent, so I look forward to going back. Though next time I shall probably ask for recommendations for less greasy options."

2015-11-20,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Ajisai Japanese Fusion,"Terrible experience here last Saturday night, which is disappointing, since we've gotten takeout before and it was tasty.  Took the kids for an end-of-football season celebration, and received the worst welcome ever.  Though the restaurant was largely empty, we were seated right next to the bathroom.  When my husband asked the hostess if we could sit across the dining room in another booth, she indicated that it was reserved, and they had a lot of reservations that evening, so she couldn't accommodate us.The next three couples/families that came in the door were seated exactly where we'd wanted to sit, and the hostess kept glancing at us nervously.  Curious, my husband politely asked those families/couples if they'd had reservations, and each told him they had not.  I'm not one to pull the race card generally, but the fact is we are a bi-racial couple, and I've seen implicit racism enough to know that it does indeed exist.  The fact is that there was a racial makeup difference between my family and those not seated near the bathroom.  The hostess's nervousness leads me to believe she felt guilty enough to show a reaction.To be fair, when I expressed my displeasure to the (very polite) waiter, he offered to move us, but the damage was done.  Had it been only my husband and myself, we'd have left, but we'd promised our kids sushi, and sushi they would have.  I told the waiter we'd order some rolls to go, and my husband and I went elsewhere to get our dinner.  We certainly won't be back.  The sushi is good, but there's better in town (I highly recommend Kai in North Raleigh).  I'm not inclined to give my money to a business that doesn't want our presence in the first place."

They also have lots of GF and Dairy Free options, which I need and appreciate. The owners are extremely warm and kind people. We are customers for life and tell everyone about it!

Tons of different toppings and if you want more of an item just ask for double.Even with 10 people in line we received our pizza within 20 minutes of walking in the door.  They definitely have their system down and I was pretty amazed at how organized the whole operation was.  There were close to 20 employees each with a specific job and it runs like clockwork. Kudos to the manager for keeping everything flowing. They also offer gluten free crust for those interested. Reasonably priced, quick, fresh, and tasty!"

I think the concept of self-service beer is so neat, and I believe this was the first place in the Triangle that had this (no one freak out if I'm wrong).Good selection of beer; I had a Big Boss Harvest Time, which is a pumpkin ale. I also had the pimiento cheese with soft pretzels appetizer, and I'd highly recommend! I'm picky about my pimiento cheese (curse of being a good Southerner), and theirs was pretty good. Our two waiters were friendly, although they probably could have stopped by a few more times (there were a lot of us, and you know that means someone is always needy).Overall, great space inside and they have outside seating if you happen to stop by when the weather is cooperating. Right next door to the Powerhouse parking deck, so that's convenient too. I'll definitely stop back by for an after-work beer!"

Spent about $120 for 3 people which I thought was a bit overpriced. Got the Shabu Shabu which was ok. I thought the beef was not cut thinly enough for shabu shabu but still fun for a cold night. (maybe that's how they like their meat in NC? I'm not sure) Their dinner set meal was a reasonable deal though because it comes with a lot of vegetable tempura, a bowl of soup/salad and also the entree for about $24. We got their teriyaki chicken which tasted a little burnt.  I would come back here again if I was in the area but probably wouldn't go out of my way for it."
2015-11-20,5.0,"Berwyn, IL",Taverna Agora,"The food and the service were amazing.  I'm kind of bummed that we didn't get a chance to have dinner there a second time before we flew home. If you can, sit upstairs for dinner, the atmosphere is dreamy."
2015-11-20,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Buku,"Have this place a first, long awaited, try for dinner with a friend last night. It was very fresh and the staff was exceptionally friendly, as well as professional. We started off with the Edamame, for an appetizer, which was very tasty and fulfilling; not too salty and it keeps you chewing. Then,  for the main course we split the Vietnamese Pho. The waiter encouraged us to get more, but we felt it was the perfect size to split. We both left full. The Vietnamese Pho was so yummy, particulate with the meat and mint in it. The condiments that they give you compliment the bowl very well, and I used it all since I like spicy.Would definition recommend giving this place a try, if you are looking for something alittle different and fresh. Seems like a good spot for a date night as well.I'm certainly be back to try more in the future."
2015-11-20,5.0,"Garner, NC",The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar,"1. Do your research ahead of time as to what you want. It'll take half an hour to read through the menu.2. Plan on leftovers. Holy moly there's so much food. I don't mind spend $16 on a burger when I know I'll get meals for the next week out of it (or one REALLY BIG meal).3. Their reservation policy, unless recently updated, is pretty dumb - no reservations after 6pm - but the wait typically isn't awful. And there's Yard House next door to get a drink while you wait for the text that your table is ready."
2015-11-20,4.0,"Knightdale, NC",Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar - Seaboard,"I try to make it out here at least once a week.  I have tried most burgers, all are good.  They have a good amount of sides to choose from, side salad, sweet potato fries, chips, fruit cup, slaw, etc.  Lunch can get busy quickly so come early.  Dinner is equally busy, a sign of a good restaurant.  The service is excellent.  The one place that has never screwed up my order, ever.  Gets a little loud is the only issue.  If you are a meatatarian, try the bacon cheeseburger on steroids."
2015-11-20,5.0,"Williamsburg, VA",Nashers Sandwich House,"I have to say I don't give five stars lightly. Having been to this place four times in the last couple of weeks, it has delivered every time. It's hard to find a place that has such good food at such good prices. There are tons of choices, and everything I've tried has been great. The serving sizes are generous, the staff friendly and accommodating, and the food is delicious. Their roast pork sandwich is amazing, as is the chicken parm. The nasher's fried chicken is a messy feast. I couldn't get enough of the corn chowder. Keep up the good work!"
2015-11-20,4.0,Greensboro,Joule Coffee,"I am probably biased but as it's here that I got a croissant the closer to what we have in France I must say I really enjoyed this place. I was able to finally get a french breakfast. Good croissant, good coffee, reading the news in their long stand tables.I never saw anything like that before and it's really cool. I am wondering if it could scare some shy people to enter the place tho, like being forced to pass in the middle of everybody oriented in your direction. In my case, I don't care, I think it's just very nice and allows you to see outside and feels like you are sit at the bar."

This is the original Char-Grill location, and it opened way back in 1959.You can order online or in-person. When you order in-person, you will fill out a paper slip with a golf pencil. You can customize your burger, sandwich, or hot dog just the way you like it. When you're done, slide your slip down the chute!Just a few minutes after you order, your name will be called and you'll pay at the window. Remember to ask for ketchup packets if they don't offer them.There's only a couple picnic tables, so you may want to be prepared to find another spot or just eat in your car.All burgers are cooked well-done, but they still come out nice and juicy. The fries are fine but nothing I really crave. If I had the choice, I'd pair all my burgers with the seasoned fries from the Snoopy's a block away."

The atmosphere was nice. It's a small local Irish pub. Authentic. My friend had the homemade pasties  ( sausage inside puff pastry with a Cajon honey mustard ) and it was great also. My waitress was very attentive and my drink never emptied. 5 stars for this one.

The server was quick and accommodating with taking our orders .. The dish I ordered was the lump crab cake with the side as an arugula salad. The dish was delicious with the portion size being just right!
2015-11-21,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",b.good,"This is my  second time here, the first with my wife, the second with my daughter. The smoothies are amazing, possibly the best I've ever had. The food is very high quality as well. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that both times it took quite a while for the food to be delivered to our table, and their catch phrase is ""real food fast."" Also, for me the burgers are much to small, and in order to be satisfied I have to order double beef on my burgers."
2015-11-21,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gringo A Go-Go,"Liked the simplicity of the menu. Service was friendly and attentive but waitress talked so fast we only got about every fourth word. Food was ok, fresh but nothing great. We're not in a big hurry to return."
2015-11-21,5.0,"Fayetteville, NC",Sono,Went to the north hills location. Clumsy waitress spilled water all over two people in our party. Manager didn't even apologize. Sushi was halfway decent (palatable) but way overpriced for the quality of fish. Don't think I'd ever go back.
2015-11-21,5.0,"West Loop, Chicago, IL",Stanbury,This place was fantastic! The service was very attentive and the food was all phenomenal. We had the pig face and the arinchini and they were both delicious and good portions for small plates.  The drinks were very good as well. I had a local beer and my wife had a cocktail that was very well done. The chocolate peanut butter cake dessert was also very tasty.
2015-11-21,4.0,"Durham, NC",Lynnwood Grill & Brewing Concern,"We decided to check out Lynnwood grill after picking my sister up at the airport. The restaurant itself is in a weird location- the lowes parking lot, but it was slammed at 9 pm on a Friday and we had to wait ten minutes for a table. Everyone was polite, and when we explained to the server it was our first time there he took the time to explain the menu. We got the dirty chips(house made chips with garlic butter) and pretzel bites as apps, and two pizzas for mains. We thought everything was delicious, and reasonably priced. They have great beers as well- I am a big coconut lover so the coconut porter was up my alley. I will definitely be back to watch basketball games this winter, especially with their great beer specials going on every night of the week. I live in brier creek, and this definitely has better bad food than wild wing cafe or Carolina ale house, so I'm willing to drive a little further for beers and a lively place to watch the game."

2015-11-21,5.0,"San Jose, CA",Gravy,Came here with my boyfriend around 8 pm for dinner. We were seated promptly and had to wait for a bit for our server to come around. The wait wasn't too bad for the entire dinner. We ordered the Bruchetta which was DELICIOUS. The textures complimented one another and the sweetness of the balsamic drizzle enhanced the oysters. I ordered the gnocchi which was a tad on the saltier side but it was still amazing and filling. I love the truffle oil. My boyfriend ordered the family gravy was okay. He could really taste the tomato in the sauce. It had a strong underlying taste. The lamb was cooked wonderfully and complimented the dish wonderfully. I would say we were overall pleased!
2015-11-21,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chubby’s Tacos,This place is one of my favorite restaurants in Raleigh.  It is close to my house as well which is an added bonus.  I almost always get the shrimp tacos on the soft corn and the rice / beans and chips combo.  Their sauces are off the charts and you can get as much as you want.  I've even got free chips refills a few times.  This place has great tasting food that won't break the bank.  Eat it!
2015-11-21,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",MOD Pizza,"Shhhhh, don't tell the other place in Morrisville, but we like this better.  Tastier, fresher, and super friendly.  We both prefer the crust and the sauce here as well.  I tried the red sauce, but sometime I intend to try the bbq one.  It's so hard to control myself because everything looks and sounds great!  I was a little afraid that I over-did it on the toppings, but it all came together and cooked down just right.  Love that there are different cheeses, as well as a wonderful variety of other toppings.  This time I tried arugula, fresh basil, rosemary, garlic, asiago, parmigiana, mozzarella, pepperoni, spicy sausage, green pepper, red onion, crushed red pepper.  All on a nice thin crispy crust that held up well with the tangy red sauce and all those toppings.Meanwhile Husband piled it on even more with everything but the kitchen sink...sundried tomatoes, mushroom, gorgonzola, pepperoncini, and plenty of meat and other cheeses.They also offer salads, shakes, garlic strips and cinnamon strips.  We were both comfortably full after our pizzas, so did not add anything else.  I like their unsweetened tea with a few squirts of their lemonade in it.   Can't beat the price!  Two pizzas with all those toppings plus two fountain drinks was just twenty bucks. Location is the corner of Millbrook and Creedmoor Road where the newer Harris Teeter is."
2015-11-21,2.0,"Manhattan, NY",Lilly’s Pizza,"Oh no, very average pizza.Please, do not pile on the toppings.  It is unnecessary,  I ordered the Thai and pesto pizzas, both personal size.  The pesto and its toppings were excessive and slid off my pie.  The Thai was better but again, why pour on mountains of food?  What a waste. I felt bad but it was too much.The flavors were decent and I lived the funky space.  But the pizza was overwhelmingly heavy, we only ate half."
2015-11-21,5.0,"Wake Forest, NC",Firebirds Wood Fired Grill,"FINALLY! A restaurant in Raleigh worth raving about. The food had FLAVOR! I ordered a salad with pecans, strawberries, and shrimp - they did it RIGHT! The dressing went perfect with the salad contents. My friend ordered a steak - steak was juicy and not dry.

2015-11-21,4.0,"Wildwood, NJ",Clouds Brewing,"I stopped in here about a month ago when I was visiting North Carolina for the first time. I was exploring Raleigh for the afternoon and had seen this place on Yelp and was intrigued by the self-serve taps, so I had to check it out. It was mid-afternoon on a Friday so it was fairly quiet. Grabbed a seat at the bar and inquired with one of the bartenders about the self-serve taps. Basically they give you a wristlet which you scan on the tap before you pour so it tracks what you're pouring, and you pay per ounce. I'll be honest I don't remember the names of the beers I tried, but the guy said they rotate regularly so that wouldn't help you much anyway haha! But I loved that you pay per ounce so you can try a few without overdoing it.The bartenders were friendly without being in your face. I ordered the steak salad to go, which was phenomenal. I'll definitely stop in again next time I'm in the area!"
2015-11-21,4.0,"Melbourne, FL",Flying Burrito,"Obviously this place has great reviews on Yelp, so I came here with some decent expectations. I left pretty disappointed. An overwhelming smell of stale beer filled the restaurant. Took forever to be given menus/place an order. I ordered a pork burrito and it was mainly stuffed with some flavorless pinto beans. I knew this place wasn't going to serve Latin food, and I didn't come for that...but I would've at least liked some flavor in the burrito. It's so weird that the Travel Channel featured this place. Won't be returning."

I went traditional and got a burger with Swiss and bacon, seasoned perfectly and cooked just the way I like it!

Will be going back soon to try the huge selection of food they have!"

The shrimp tempura was  I loved being able to get the booth where patrons get to sit on the floor at the table. Service was fast and helpful. It's not cheap, of course, but with that in mind, come on an empty stomach as you will receive plenty of food. Was glad I came and hope to be back again for sushi and cocktails."
2015-11-21,4.0,"Indianapolis, IN",Capital Club 16,"What an awesome lunch we had here! You can add a protein to a salad (I got shrimp) and the soup was good. The best thing there though--try as I might to restrain myself--was the fries. Oh. My. The setting was so beautiful with the wide and tall windows, and I loved the quirky art and decor. And the super fun chairs, which I believe we were told came from a restaurant in NYC. The bar was also really cool too. Will be back next time in Raleigh."
2015-11-21,5.0,"Greensboro, NC",First Watch,"The ambiance is cozy with a modern kitchen vibe; a mix of calm blues and greens with rich wood and steel accents. Our server was friendly and attentive, and was gracious even when we stayed well after we finished our food. The food was good, though not extraordinary. At the recommendation of our server, I got the avocado bacon hash with poached eggs. The eggs were yummy, but the dish was a bit lacking with the avocado (two thin slices of soft avocado) and bacon. The potatoes could have been browned more (they were pretty white and almost undercooked), and seasoned better for more flavor. That said, I still ate most everything on my plate! And the buttered English muffin and fruit tin were nice free sides. The fresh juices were pretty good. I sampled the orange carrot ginger juice (slightly sweet, well-rounded carrot flavor) and the kale tonic. The kale tonic was light and refreshing, with a strong lemon overtone. Overall, it was a pleasant, comfortable experience with good company. I would go back!"
2015-11-21,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Driftwood Southern Kitchen,"Best ribs I have ever had! I got the ""small"" portion and still got six ribs!! It came with some killer Mac n cheese. The decor inside is really pretty and fun! I really enjoyed my meal and will be back to try other items! The only reason I knocked off a star was because of service- our waiter didn't seem like he wanted to be there. I don't think I ever saw him smile! Overall, it was a good dining experience."

2015-11-21,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Standard Foods,"Nice little grocery shopping for a weekend morning. I like the concrete floors and more urban warehouse feel. If I had to describe the selection, I would say it's very similar to what I would want from the state farmer's market, but wayyyyy less overwhelming. And with additional cute things. And well decorated/designed. The market is connected to the dining area, which had a clean and open feel. I got some really great produce (eating the arugula now!). Super reasonably priced, too. I spotted some homemade pickles and kimchi I'll be back for, and want to try some of the prepared food they had in the display when I go next. They have lots of local companies featured for  perishable items as well as local farms for the produce and meats.Would have loved to find some coffee, but I also didn't ask... so maybe it's there. The only downside to the seasonal local aspect is that you can't come NEEDING one particular thing; you kind of have to just go with what's available. I'll be back. I may have to sell my first born to get a table at the restaurant though... ;)"

The coconut rice had just the right amount of sweetness but the rice grains were dry and almost crunchy as if the rice had been sitting for a long time. Both meals were overpriced at $11.00 and $13.00 respectively. I really wanted to like this place after hearing about it months ago.  While I enjoyed the $8.00 shot of Sauza tequila, I am deeply disappointed because the overall experience was not worth the wait nor was it worth the $21.00 plus tip that I paid.

2015-11-21,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Standard Foods,"Had heard that this place was a joint venture between former Herons executive chef Scott Crawford and developer John Holmes and had to try it out.  First thing I notice is there is very little parking.  I got there early, so luckily I found street parking.  Also signage is very discreet.  I had a feeling it was going to be hard to get a table so I got there around 6.  Already the hostesses we unable, as a walk-in, to offer me a table at 7pm for 2.  So the next best option was the bar.  I had a spicy cocktail and waited for my friend.  I'm certain the hostess told me that the bar was first come first serve, however two seats remained open for a good hour.  Every time someone tried to sit there, she'd run over and say that they were reserved. Once my friend arrived we ordered the crab deviled eggs which were delicious.  I then ordered the pork belly with carrot tortellini, friend ordered apple soup.  Pork belly was amazing, and my friend ultimately wasn't satisfied with sharing and ordered her own.  Apple soup was great in its own buttery right.  Splurged on the Panna cotta dessert, it was ok.  I will definitely be back.  Word of advice, if you don't have a reservation, get there early!"

Had their takes on the eggs benedict classic, which they called the Coastal Benedict and Fried Green Tomato Benedict. Both were tasty - I'd give the edge to the Coastal.

2015-11-22,5.0,"Arlington, VA",ORO Restaurant & Lounge,"Came here for a private party with many people (50?). They handled the crowd well but since it was mostly beer and wine, they could have had some of the wine poured ahead of time. Once everyone was served once, it was better. Getting that first drink took a bit. Passed apps included Cramelized pork belly (awesome small bite the size of a nickel on a toothpick); Spring rolls (delicious, crunch outside size of a quarter, served on a bed of Asian sweet hot sauce); Chicken cordon blue (fried with a little sauce on top- very popular. They were hot); Caprese salad (mini ball of mozzarella, mini skinned tomatoe, sauce- on a skewer. Loved these and had a few. Brilliant idea to skin the tomatoe.);  Beef Wellington (the size of empanadas. I didn't have any of these but those that do are several).In the back they had large platters but I don't think many people knew they were  there. Someone told me but my friend didn't hear it. Platters: Cheese with three kinds of delicious cheese- a goat, a manchego, another mild one. Deli meat  plate had salami, prosciutto, and another. The hummus platter had a delicious bread cut into triangles that held up for the scooping. Dirty Martini was good and worth the extra cost. They had blue cheese stuffed olives. I tried the Malbec wine and it was good."

We ordered our pizza and an hour later when I saw everyone who came in after me got their food, I went up to the counter to ask for an update. The first guy was a straight up ass. The. What looks like the kitchen ""manager"" came out and apologized saying ""the pizza bottom fell out"" and it will be out in a few minutes. 15 minutes later I'm still starving. Why couldn't anyone tell me there was an issue? Instead of having me sit there. The order taking process? Yeah you have to stand in line only to be greeted by a lady who HATES her job with piercings all over her face. The way I was spoken to was almost as if I interrupted her on her day off. IM SO SORRY! The rest of the staff is literally the rudest on the world. I cannot tell you how many times I witnessed them coming out the kitchen caking out a name and then slamming and sliding the pizza over to the customer in the most rude way. It also didn't help when I went to check on the pizza I saw half the staff playing around and joking, when they have starving customers. Dod I mention some of them were just talking on the phone? Yeah that went down. I don't know who Lily is, but it seems that everyone who works there hates their job. Literally the most unfriendly service in Raleigh. Literally cannot express how awful of customer service this place has and how shitty people's attitudes were. Disgusting. Will never come back."

The brunch menu is a nice mix of omelettes, wood fired pizzas, panini's, and salads. Mimosas and Bloody Marys, along with some specialty cocktails, too. The pizzas are pretty big and priced super well.. I was surprised reading some of the reviews about the price here. I feel like they are worth it and well beyond the $12-$15 they cost. We got the Rocco's Pie and salad... plenty left for leftovers. The bar staff was very attentive and friendly. Love the exposed brick and wooden beams.

2015-11-22,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Lilly’s Pizza,"We had two hours to kill before a Saturday night movie and had a taste for a good pizza. Good thing we had those two hours to kill - the wait was HORRENDOUS. The order process was extremely inefficient. I accidentally took the wrong salad order meant for another table when the server brought it out. Tara sounds a whole lot like Sarah and the place was crowded and loud. Maybe give order numbers or something if you want to avoid that. The server actually gave me attitude about it, to which I apologized and said I didn't mean to, but she was still rude. Now for the wait time it took to get our pizza. An hour, easy. Again, good thing we had those two hours to kill. When we realized that everyone who ordered after us had their food, we thought there might be a problem. We were told that ""the bottom of our pizza fell out (what does that even mean?)"" and it'd be another ""two minutes."" Well those two minutes turned into another 10-15 minutes. So I go up to the counter (again) and I'm faced with extremely apathetic workers who could care less, and the kitchen manager giving a too little too late apology. I'll also mention I could see straight into the kitchen, and there were many employees without gloves and dicking around. I'm hangry at this point and ready to call it quits, but the pizza finally comes out.It was good, but not worth the ridiculous wait and beyond poor customer service. For that I can only give this Lilly's Pizza two stars. I worked in the restaurant industry through college and always try to be understanding, but I really cannot condone the beyond poor service we experienced. Hands down, the worst service I've ever experienced. Likely will not be back. The Lilly's in Durham was much nicer. I would recommend you only go if you have hours (and I mean hours) to wait for a simple pizza dinner."

Having been intrigued by the reviews I've read of this breakfast/brunch/lunch place not far from home, we had the nerve to brave showing up at prime time on a Sunday.  (around 11am).  Luckily for us, we were greeted warmly and seated promptly where we proceeded to have a thoroughly delightful time, thanks in large part to the caring, knowledgeable Server with the great name of Tequila!  We were seated promptly and offered drinks immediately.  Coffee for Husband.  Hot tea for me, and SCORE, organic teas!  The menu is pretty large, with even more recent offerings as well.  I was enticed by the new BLT Benedict.  Husband went with The Works Omelet.  We were seated near the kitchen, which I enjoyed, as it was cool to witness their hard work and proficiency.  (preparing breakfast for huge quantities with varying tastes on a Sunday cannot be easy!) They seemed to have it down to an impressive science.  Very commendable.Soon our meals arrived, with my Benedict looking more like a salad.  It was covered in green, and I loved that!  The tangy greens helped offset the richness of the perfectly cooked benedict with perfectly poached eggs, tomato, crispy tasty bacon and an excellent ciabatta.  Rates right up there with the best benedicts I've ever had.Meanwhile Husband commented that his English Muffin was of very good quality.  He did say that his omelet was slightly overcooked on the outside, while the middle was a tad under.  And his potatoes were a bit undercooked as well.  None of that stopped him from scarfing it all down.Note:  pay on the way out.  We found it best to wait for the line to die down before getting up and facing it.  We were rewarded on the way out with not only a friendly gal, but chocolate mints.  'nuff said.  We'll be back."
2015-11-22,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Waraji Japanese Restaurant,"The freshest and most authentic sushi in Raleigh!The wait for a table was long so we sat at the sushi bar, and I'm so glad we did. The sushi chef gave us a special taste of Wagyu beef that was absolutely incredible. He described everything in detail, and was extremely knowledgable and skilled.Unlike many other places in Raleigh, Wariji is not BOGO, so it ends up being pretty pricey. I can assure you that it is worth it!Between two of us, we got three rolls, all of which were pretty big. The Suzuku 500 was my favorite - so much salmon! Wariji doesn't overdo the rice, each roll had plenty of filling. We also really enjoyed the Sweet Dragon roll, the eel was incredibly fresh. The Scary Jerry was good as well, and since he knew we were splitting it, the chef made half spicy and half mild since my boyfriend doesn't like as much heat. Overall, I felt well taken care of and really enjoyed the sushi. I would highly recommend it!c"
2015-11-22,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Second Empire Restaurant And Tavern,Food is okay but the service is superb .
2015-11-22,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Relish Café & Bar,Really like their assortment of mac & cheese. The brunch menu on the weekend is also pretty substantial with an assortment of different foods. The chorizo tacos with eggs were very good. The outdoor seating is very nice and an option I enjoyed choosing over the summer and fall. The atmosphere inside was nice and could be a romantic date spot as well. Would recommend this to anyone looks for a brunch place away from downtown Raleigh.
2015-11-22,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Big Ed’s City Market Restaurant,"This is a cute place to go for breakfast. I have been here several times with my parents, and I can speak highly of the pancakes and waffles, as well as the friendly waitstaff. Kitschy decor adorns the walls."
2015-11-22,5.0,"Knightdale, NC",Tupelo Honey Cafe Raleigh,"I decided to go to THC for brunch with my daughter and her friend. We had a hard time deciding what to order because everything looked so delicious!  The waitress was very tentative!After we decided, our food promptly arrived at our table. Needless to say, we were all happy campers! Make sure you call ahead for reservations because the wait can be very long!"
2015-11-22,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",First Watch,We come here every now and then and have never been disappointed. The food comes out in a timely manner and the staff is one of the friendliest I've ever encountered. The specials are always sure to be a good pick! I tried the key west crepeggs this time around. A nice twist on your traditional breakfast. Our server was quick and attentive! Of course we will be back!
2015-11-22,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Relish Café & Bar,"My husband and I stopped here for brunch and couldn't have had a better experience! The food was excellent and came out very quickly. There was a delightful assortment of fruits (instead of just melon). Plus they had a big selection of Mighty Leaf tea, which was great. :) Our waitress, Shirley, was very kind and helpful - she definitely contributed to our experience! :)"
2015-11-22,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Yard House,"This is a go-to spot for my friends and I to just get out and have a drink and a bite for girl talk. Lots of great people watching and nice big bar to belly up to. The food can be a little hit or miss, but there are many things that I'd order again and again:Street tacos (especially the vampire)Ahi poke bowlFlat breads Truffle fries (a favorite of my friend)Chicken nachosLamb burgerSide Caesar salad (turned into full size salad and add steak)The best thing about this place are the ample TVs, bustling ambience,  and bar offerings (big beer/wine list & good cocktails)."
2015-11-22,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Trophy Brewing Company,"Interesting pizzas and beer. I enjoyed the roasted winter veggie pizza, and severalof the saisons I've sampled on several occasions. Space is matchbox-sized, so you must visit on an off time, say 3 p.m., have some beers then order your food before the masses descend on the place."
2015-11-22,5.0,"Arlington, VA",Sitti,"Went for a private pre-arranged group business dinner of about 20 people. Our private party ate downstairs in the ""basement"" like area.  Interesting atmosphere- very dark but comfy in a weird way. The table was set in a u shape which meant some folks' back faced the group. They had a printed menu which was a nice touch. We started with 4 Mezze plates: hummus, baba Ghanouj, falafel, and kibbee mikli. All were good! Two were fried and if I was ordering by myself, I would only do either the falafel or the kibbee, not both. Next course was the fattoush salad and it was refreshing. Next were five entrees: Vegetable kabob, lamb chops, chicken and artichoke, Samkeh Harra (salmon), and rice. The salmon was delicious, the chicken a winner (my favorite) with unique flavors and a broth I wanted to continuous scoop and pour on my chicken. The lamb was overdone for my taste. Lastly were two desserts baklava and cookies. Baklava was worth the calories!!! Services was good."
2015-11-22,4.0,"Cary, NC",Sitti,"If you want upscale Mediterranean food and adult beverages, then that pretty much leads you to Sitti.I kept saying 'no' for some silly reason to checking the place out, but thankfully my wife wore me down.We ordered way too much food - appetizers, entrees, and desserts. Plus drinks. It was all great."
2015-11-22,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Rise Biscuits & Donuts,"Lots of hype about Rise...you can tell from the long line this morning! The wait gave me time to decide what I wanted to order. I got the fried eggplant biscuit with cheddar cheese and the Bullseye donut with rice pudding. The biscuit was tasty, but not mind-blowing. I enjoyed the donut more. I will be back, hopefully a little earlier so the line isn't too long!"
2015-11-23,4.0,"Cary, NC",Brio Tuscan Grille,"The food at Brio is very authentic with lots of Italian flavor. This restaurant is always busy and their bar menu draws a crowd weekdays between 4:30 and 6:30 with drink and bar food specials. I was able to make a reservation on Opentable.com for two on a Friday night and it was very busy. When we arrived, we waited just a few minutes and were then taken to our table. The private rooms in the back were full and so were all the other tables. The kitchen is open so you can see all of the food action and that does add a lot to the noise level of the dining room. The noise level is my only gripe with Brio because it deters from a quiet meal. I had the Chicken Milanese and the portion size is perfect. It was just right where I did not have to ask for a to-go container. The sauce was very authentic and noodles cooked perfectly.  The salads to add on for $4.25 are also nicely presented and we had the Insalata Bistecca with wedge lettuce, blue cheese dressing and bacon. The sourdough bread and crisp served at the beginning are also a nice touch. Since the restaurant was so buy on Friday night, a manager was going around and helping clear the tables. I appreciated that he cleared from the right and knew the proper etiquette. We only had one small error in our bill where the regular price was listed instead of the special price and he immediately took of the $7 surcharge that was incorrect in the system. Brio is a great place to dine while shopping at Crabtree or just come here for a meal."
2015-11-23,5.0,"Morrisville, NC",Sono,"I've been to Sono a few times and always had great experience.Their sushi are fresh and have great flavor, but I wish there were more options without cream cheese. I've had chirashi there once and everything on it was really good, especially tamago.Last time here we got pork belly buns as an appetizer (holy yum!). Even if you are not a fan of pork belly, try it. It's crunchy and soft and very flavorful.I heard good things about their ramen (from Yelp ramen article) so I had to try it. I got Shoyu Ramen and it was amazing. The broth was light, but full of smoky flavor, the noodles perfectly done, the egg - solid white and soft yolk, oh I wish i could cook the egg to that perfection!There were 2 large pieces of pork, black mushrooms and bamboo shoots - all delicious. The pork was a bit tough though, and hard to eat with chopsticks. I wish it was more tender, or cut smaller, as I didn't have any means to cut it.The bowl was so large that I couldn't finish my portion, definitely a great deal!We got a pleasant surprise on our bill - apparently the 2 sushi orders were either half price or bogo due to ""happy hour"" (we came at 6pm).I will definitely be back to try the Tonkotsu Ramen, which smelled and looked amazing, and this time will be sure to be hungry."
2015-11-23,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Flying Biscuit Café,"Dined here for Sunday brunch and it was extremely busy. There was a 45 minute to an hour wait for a table for 2 however we had been wanting to try this place for awhile.Flying biscuit is decorated with bright colors and located in Cameron village. There's plenty of parking however when this place is busy, it's hard to move around. There were a ton of people everywhere so we stood outside while we waited for our table. After 45 minutes a spot at the bar opened up and we decided to eat there.We ordered a few bloody Mary's, the Piedmont omelette, and the Egg-stravaganza. The bartender brought us some biscuits/apple butter, it was delicious. I completely understand why everyone comes here for that. Everything we ordered was good except for the French toast and scrambled eggs on the egg-stravaganza. I ordered my eggs scrambled with light cheese. The eggs were cold, had so much cheese in them,I couldn't eat them and the French toast was far from French. We sent it back twice because it tasted like a dry piece of wheat toast drenched in raspberry sauce. The bartender was nice enough to replace it with a pancake...the pancake was amazing.The service is pretty good and I'd dine here again!"
2015-11-23,5.0,"Durham, NC",Stanbury,Absolutely delicious. Flavorful unique dishes! It was quite a treat dining at this restaurant. The menu had a nice variety of small plates and large plates to choose from. Their cocktails are creative and tasty as well. We will definitely be back many more times!
2015-11-23,5.0,"Morrisville, NC",Shish Kabob,"Had walked by this place several times and was curious to try some of their food. Had the chicken and rice with tzatziki sauce and bread. Everything was very tasty. Flavorful meat, tasty spices in the rice and One of the better tzatzikis I've had. This is much better than any fast food in the area, perfect for a quick and relatively healthy meal. My dish was 8 usd which i don't think is bad at all. I look forward to coming back soon next time I'm in downtown Raleigh and try the lamb. Also, the staff seem very friendly."
2015-11-23,4.0,"Safety Harbor, FL",The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar,"Wow! I NEVER thought I would enjoy a burger in sushi form! If you are in town, YOU MUST TRY THIS EXPERIENCE!This just goes to show you, it's awesome to get a little out of your comfort zone. We had the ""Burgoshi"" which was ground beef rolled in rice and a thin potato and lightly fried.... It was BEYOND delicious!  Also had some type of philly sushi panini. Awesome, but recommend the actual burger rolls more.Our server was fantastic and patiently explained the extensive burger, sushi, and Burgoshi menu.Decor was a funky, modern, Japanese feel, complete with a sushi saltwater fish tank."
2015-11-23,4.0,"Freehold, NJ",Another Broken Egg Cafe,"Ordered the Chobani Tuile, which I have had before at the Cary location. It was basically half the size of the one I've had before. I got maybe a cup of yogurt inside a tiny waffer. Not exactly $10 worth of a meal. I was also very disappointed that my yogurt was drenched in frozen blueberries (apparently out of the strawberries and blackberries that were also supposed to come with it) still partially cold and very soggy from being heated up. Any place that serves frozen fruit over fresh fruit, especially one that advertises as ""gourmet"" and ""with the finest ingredients"" is a place I'm never going to again."
2015-11-23,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",510 Tavern,"Myself & 3 friends walked in 3 weeks ago on a Friday night.  That was the night I had the best smoked wings I have ever eaten.  They came out bare, sauce on the side.  I never even touched the sauce.  Since then we have been back the last 3 Fridays in a row.  This past Friday night my buddy ordered the Short Rid Mac N Cheese.  That dish knocked it out of the park!  Chef brought out a deep fried Dulce de Leche Flambe', and we all practically fought for the last bite! lol  The service has been great all 3 visits and the food continues to exceed my expectations.  This one is definitely a winner!!"
2015-11-23,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Soo Café,"What makes Soo Cafe such an amazing place? Superb chicken and fantastic service! Upon the commendation of a coworker, I realized that I had not been back to Soo Cafe in ages and I was missing out on their famous Korean fried chicken. On my most recent visit, we ordered the Old Fashioned and Soga (soy garlic) wings and both were deliciously spicy. In my opinion, it was the perfect level of spice in that the heat was there but you could still enjoy the other flavors. There was an option for a more extreme spice level but not for no spice at all. The menu warns you that if you do not like spicy, do not order a sauce but you can still order the fried wings. We each ordered the 5 wings and 1 drumstick and were pleased to see how huge the pieces of chicken were. The establishment is nicely decorated in the bright traditional Korean colors and the TV typically has KPop music on which is interesting to watch. The service matches the quality of the food; it is exceptional. They are extremely friendly and informative."
2015-11-23,5.0,"Cary, NC",Second Empire Restaurant And Tavern,"I had never visited this establishment until this weekend when I took my date (to celebrate her birthday) and it was a great experience.  Parking was available at the street level, but there were ample spaces available at nearby buildings reserved for Second Empire customers.  We had arrived an hour early before the actual reservation time so we proceeded to the bar/tavern area (on the lower level) for some drinks before the dinner. The tavern area was small, yet cozy and comfortable and we both enjoyed our glasses of wine (there was even a TV at the bar).  Once we were seated, the server/waitress showed my date her personalized menu and went through it thoroughly.  The food was great, for our first course we both ordered the baby mesclun salad and for the main courses she ordered the ""sautéed new bedford sea scallops"" while I got the ""pan-roasted latin seasoned swordfish"".  They were superb (in terms of both presentation and taste), both the scallops and the swordfish were cooked just right along with the eggplants, beets and greens combined to fit very well. I wish I had taken pictures of the food, but I was paying too much attention to her and the food!  After the meal, the waitress presented us with the dessert menu which I believed it to be quite impressive, with items that you don't see in other similar restaurants in the area.  However, we had to skip the desserts, since we had decided early to visit another location for them.  Nonetheless, they brought her a scoop of ice cream for her with a strawberry and candle.Overall, we had a great experience in terms of service, meal, and atmosphere.  I'm from the San Francisco Bay area and this place reminded me of a few restaurants that I visited in the city (as well Napa).  Therefore, if you have a special occasion and reasons to celebrate, I would highly recommend visiting Second Empire."
2015-11-23,5.0,"Berlin, Germany",Big Ed’s City Market Restaurant,Great southern food. The waitress was attentive and sweet even though the place was packed because NC State had a home game that day. High recommend if you are in Raleigh for the first time.
2015-11-23,5.0,"Florence, KY",Gino’s Pizza,"We were in need of a last minute dinner for our soccer team and their family. The owner was willing to accommodate us, but offered the option of catering to our hotel. It was much less expensive for everyone, and allowed us to socialize much more freely. Bake ziti was wonderful, and the pizza was good too. Thanks so much."
2015-11-23,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Raleigh Times Bar,"This is my favorite spot in all of Raleigh.  All the staff are very cool and attentive.  The food is on point, but if there is something you don't like, chances are it will be removed on the one of the menu re-vamps.  This has been a meeting place for my circle of friends for several years now.  Great place."
2015-11-23,3.0,"Chicago, IL",Aladdin’s Eatery,"5 stars for the tropical storm smoothie! I got the lentil soup with chicken which is very good (a little on the salty side for me, but still tasty and satisfying and otherwise very healthy)3rd time I have been here. Got more chicken in my soup this time (yay protein!)This place is quickly becoming a staple for me in Brier Creek. I would recommend this to anybody who wants some no-fuss, reasonably priced, tasty Lebanese comfort food."
2015-11-23,5.0,"Berlin, Germany",Trophy Brewing Company,I've eaten at about 10 pizzerias in Raleigh. I thought this was the best pizza in the city. It's traditional American pizza. The crust was very flavorful and the beer was good. This is also a good place to meet not college aged people in Raleigh.
2015-11-23,4.0,"Missouri City, TX",Aladdin’s Eatery,"The environment and service of this place was nice, but I was not greatly impressed with the food that I had. I had the chicken shawarma rolled and for the price it was just okay. The service and the atmosphere was nice for a sat lunch spot and not overly crowded. My friend got an entree and her food was much bigger and tastier than what I got. Therefore, I would recommend getting one of those the amount of food is worth the price."
2015-11-23,5.0,"Lizard Lick, NC",Gonza Tacos Y Tequila,"Was nearby on Saturday night and knew they would be packed, but decided to give it a shot anyways as I love the lead mine location.The manager and hostess seemed to be doing a fantastic job accommodating the large crowd. Service was good. And fortunately, the food was just as good as expected despite the crowd. Considering they haven't been open long, all this was quite impressive."
2015-11-23,4.0,"Falls Church, VA",The Morning Times,"It's a cool place, conveniently located downtown. They have a nice upstairs with seating, so don't worry if you don't see a seat available when you first walk in. I ordered a breakfast burrito with bacon and my colleague had the french toast. It took a while, but they said they were transitioning from breakfast to lunch. It was not even 9am, so I'm don't really understand that. They also forgot my bacon that costs ""an additional $1.50"". Don't judge me, I love bacon! Breakfast burrito was meh, but my co-worker liked his french toast. They gave us free hot cider because the meal took so long. I'll go somewhere else next time I'm in Raleigh."

2015-11-23,5.0,"Morrisville, NC",The Station,"The Station has a great outdoor space, but unfortunately despite the heaters and the fireplaces it was too cold to sit outside, so we opted for the indoor brunch that starts at 11am on Sundays.There are only a few brunch items and they all look good, but I decided to go with my all time favorite corned beef. Although beautifully served in a cast iron skillet alongside a toasted biscuit and jam, I was disappointed with the taste. The beef itself was extremely salty, tough and hard to chew, the potatoes underdone. Even the cheddar on top could not help the taste, and in fact, was unnecessary (I never thought I'd say cheese was unnecessary, but the overly salty beef was overwhelming and didn't need more help). The over easy eggs, I must say, were prepared perfectly and almost saved the dish.My boyfriend's biscuit and sausage gravy were tasty, just savory and sweet enough. I liked the cheesy grits as well, and the toasted biscuit was heavenly - warm and golden crunchy on the outside, soft and flaky on the inside - perfection.We didn't stay long enough to try the Bloody Marys (amazingly good, I was told), but I'll be sure to try them next time."
2015-11-23,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gonza Tacos y Tequila,Favorite restaurant in Raleigh!! Amazing food- always torn between the taco dishes. Ask about the specials- they are always great!
2015-11-23,4.0,"Safety Harbor, FL",Beasley’s Chicken & Honey,"If your looking for southern cooking now downtown, this is the place! A noFrills, laid back place where the menus are on chalkboards above your heads and you. Service was efficient, but the seating was not the most comfortable. Food was great, had the fried chicken and waffles with Mac and cheese!"
2015-11-24,4.0,"Fremont, CA",Shuckers Oyster Bar & Grill,"Best place I've been so far downtown. The waitress was very nice, and the atmosphere was great. LOVED the lighting, it's just bright enough but dark enough. We went on a Tuesday to celebrate, and there weren't many people in there but that just made it a more quiet and relaxing experience. (Not that it wouldn't be if more people were there) we got shrimp cocktail to start, yum! Drink specials were great, I had a patron margarita for $6 and he had a draft for $2. I got the scallops and a side of rice, it was literally the best. He had the catch of the day, mahi mahi and YUMMY. It was all cooked so well. And you get free hush puppies, how could you not love this place!?"
2015-11-24,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Oakwood Café,"I lived/studied abroad in Argentina and I'm so excited to find an authentic Argentine cuisine like this in Raleigh! I went with my husband, parents, and toddler on a Thursday for dinner and it was a quaint, relaxing atmosphere and most of the people were there were young adults out with friends (so at first I was scared of being judged for bringing a toddler, but she did great and everyone was friendly) and a few regulars (you could just tell). We had a bottle of Malbec and I ordered the beef Milanesa and it was absolutely delicious!! I'm dying to go back again soon!"
2015-11-24,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Lynnwood Grill & Brewing Concern,"I've been to Lynnwood Grill twice now and really love it here! Considering the area and what's nearby, I'm a bit surprised by how busy it gets here! I realize there's a movie theater close by but this place is a bit isolated from other restaurants or hot spots... but now it'll be a regular place for my roommates and I since it's not too far away from the Brier Creek area. Yes, they brew their own beer which is awesome! I'm a big fan of their Hop on Top but would recommend taking advantage of their flights to really sample their selection. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to try one of their seasonal brews (pumpkin!!) but will be back soon to try it out. On my first visit here they were actually out of three different beers my friend and I wanted to try... not too happy about that but I'll live. The food is actually good in my book. I read some reviews where other reviewers were left wanting more but I was more than satisfied with their pizzas. I've tried their barbecued chicken and Chicken Pesto pizza and found myself wanting to continue to stuff my face--always a good sign right? The barbecued chicken pizza was flavorful and the tanginess of the bbq sauce paired so well with the chicken and jalapeños. It wasn't as spicy as one with think but some crushed red pepper flakes helped to fix that for me. The chicken pesto pizza was delicious as well. My only compliant with that particular pizza would be that the chicken on the pizza was too large, like huge chunks, and a bit dry. I also ordered their pretzel bites with beer cheese and really enjoyed it! I'm still a bit confused as to why the cheese came out in a to go sauce cup with a lid but hey, it was still tasty. The service at Lynnwood Grill has been a hit or miss. On my first visit, our server was hard to find and barely came to our table. We were in a bit of a rush too since we were trying to make it to the Hurricanes game so that may have skewed my opinion but it was pretty frustrating to have a server tend to the tables directly next to us and skip over us several times.... However, the second time around, our server was great! Very attentive and made sure to check up on us even when we were sat a bit out of the way near the bar. Also, the bartenders provide fast service and very friendly. So, in sum, maybe don't come when you're pressed for time as they do get busy but definitely check out Lynnwood Grill if you're nearby and looking for a relaxing place to enjoy some brews and food. They also have weekly specials, including drink specials! Another reason to check this place out, especially if you aren't looking to spend a lot of $$$."
2015-11-24,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Busy Bee Cafe,"I frequent this place pretty much every Friday night for dinner, sometimes mid-week, and my experience is always incredible. The food menu changes pretty often, although not frequently enough that you'll miss out on your favorite menu items. I've gotten a few dishes here and they've all been great but one dish is spectacular: organic chicken. It may come as a surprise but this is the most flavorful chicken dish I've tasted, anywhere. It rivals that of Ashley Christensen's ""Roasted Chicken"" at Poole's Diner and a bit cheaper too. The chicken is moist, never overlooked, and the bourbon-mustard glaze is perfection. The green beans are fresh and steamed perfectly. The mashed potatoes can have some chunks in them, but it doesn't take away from the dish. The wait staff are amazing. It's seat yourself, but as soon as you sit down someone approaches within the minute. Sometimes it's the manager, which makes the experience that much better. How many other restaurants has the manager taking drink orders? The staff is always friendly and there's never any issues. I've been to a lot of Raleigh restaurants, but for my go-to night out for good food, I choose Busy Bee."
2015-11-24,5.0,"Snow Camp, NC",510 Tavern,2 customers  at bar when we arrived. Drink & appetizer order quick and delivered quickly. After 15+ minutes had to interrupt the waiter who was texting to ask to order. Food delivered 22 minutes later.
2015-11-24,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Barry’s Cafe,"So we had previously lived about a quarter mile from this place and had never noticed it before! It is located in a very nondescript strip mall. The place was a bit crowded but was well managed by the wife of the owner, Barry. The cafe is lined with firemen memorabilia and collectibles from all around the country. I initially assumed that he may have been a fireman at some point of time, but it looks like he is an advent support of firemen across the country (look up his story on his website. Its worth a read and quite inspiring)The service is super quick, the menu is just about right without too much confusion. As an egg-itarian I didn't have much difficulty in finding choices for brunch. The coffee is wonderful and the portions on the omlettes and pancakes are right. I was a bit disappointed that they didn't have traditional southern hash browns. All in all, brunch for two at $22 was not bad at all!"
2015-11-24,1.0,"North Charleston, SC",Winston’s Grille,"It was ok. I think for the quality of food it was overpriced. My husbands steak had to be sent back twice because it was the wrong temp. The manager was very kind and helpful in this and our waiter was good. We had 2 kids with us and 1 didn't even eat off of the kids menu, but the tip was included because we were a party of 6... Overall the food was ok and the service was good."
2015-11-24,5.0,"Hudson, OH",Plates Neighborhood Kitchen,I have never eaten a dish that I did not want to finish because it was so good. Braised Short Ribs are fantastic.
2015-11-24,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gravy,"Walked in mid afternoon, other than the bartender and a single waiter the place was empty. Asked if they were open they said, for us, of course!  Obviously not a midday destination. Having said that, this was one of the better meals I've had in some time. It is clear they use fresh local ingredients, the chicken on my sandwich was some of the best I've ever tasted. The burger my companion had was equally as good. I will go back again if for no other reason than the home made mozzarella. And oh what a treat is the Risotto balls! Prices are very reasonable in my opinion, considering the quality of the ingredients and what other Italian places charge. Wish they had another location away from downtown but will make the trek again soon.  Definitely worth it!"
2015-11-24,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Big Ed’s North,"Today was my first visit to Big Ed's. When we arrived, there was a line of people waiting outside. We waited patiently until there was room for us to step inside. I stepped inside before my two male friends, where I was immediately accosted by the cashier. I don't know her name, but she was an older, blondish, heavyset woman. She told me that seating is on a first-come, first-served basis. I told her that I understood that and that I had been waiting in the line to enter. She then proceeded to accuse me of jumping ahead of the people behind me (who were with me). I let the cashier know that the people behind me were WITH me. Instead of apologizing, the cashier just stated they could come in. No apology, even after the cashier realized her error. Not a good first impression of the restaurant. When we were seated, we were approached by a friendly waitress, who took our order promptly. Our food was plentiful and delicious! I will go back for the food, but if I was the owner of the restaurant, I would definitely want a friendlier face at the entrance of the restaurant, not someone who is going to accuse patrons of line jumping and then not even apologize. The service and food were excellent. I removed one star from my review only due to the ""bouncer"" at the front door. Definitely a good place to eat! Good food and nice atmosphere!Went back for dinner tonight. Meatloaf, mashed potatoes, banana pudding, sweet tea (the best I've ever tasted). Dinner was amazing! Will definitely be going back; we have found our new favorite spot (and no bouncer this time!)."

2015-11-24,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Big Al’s BBQ,I always stop at this this place after every dive i make at fantasy lake with students. Thus place warms the body with great taste and great sides.  One of the best bbq places in the area.
2015-11-24,2.0,"Garner, NC",David’s Dumpling & Noodle Bar,I think my biggest issue with David's Dumpling & Noodle Bar was one of high expectations.  The dumplings I had were very similar in taste and quality to the ones I get in the frozen food isle at the Asian grocery.  Don't get me wrong I like the dumpling I get at the Asian grocery but I expected better.  The Pad Thai was good but again not outstanding.  The food was okay but it just didn't have me saying we have got eat here again.Atmosphere 3 - I remember the place when it was a Darrell's. It still has some of that old charm but spruced up a good bit. Service 3 - I didn't have any problems with the service.  My server was prompt and friendly.  Cost/Value 2 -  The prices felt high for what I got.Food 2.5 - The food quality was okay.  It wasn't bad by any mean's but I was expecting much better.

2015-11-24,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kamado Grille,"Our waiter was super friendly, and the decor is really nice. I had the Reuben, which was really good; my only complaint food wise was that there wasn't enough butter on the rye bread. The Gouda mashed potatoes were delish. The best food item though was the white chocolate bread pudding. Seriously, the best dessert I've ever had in a restaurant. Definitely hope this place stays around."
2015-11-24,5.0,"Morrisville, NC",Standard Foods,"I've been here twice recently and I now feel like I can give a more well rounded review. While this place is pretty cool, it's not exactly my style.Location: fantastic! Two doors down from a wine store/bar one way and two doors down from a ""normal"" bar the other way. Atmosphere: it's pretty tight and crowded and very loud. Definitely have a classy vibe without the white table clothes.Food: Of the highest quality! Everything you get there will be delicious. We have gotten the chicken and beef before-both were very tender with perfectly seasoned vegetables (some of which I claimed I didn't like before I tried them at standard foods). The butter lettuce salad is amazing! Anything you get with bread will be saturated in butter and other flavors (which I love). The cauliflower side is very good and for some reason reminded me of Mac and cheese. The desserts are a little more iffy in my opinion. The rum cake is very good, but the goat cheese in it might make you second think it. We also got the chocolate mouse triffle-very good but a little heavy on the meringue in my opinion.Prices: pretty pricey for the small portions in my opinion. It is very easy to rack up a high bill. You are definitely paying for the quality of food (which is good but maybe not quite worth the price tag).Service: amazing and attentive. I will say they do not do much customizing of the dishes. I tried to sub out mushrooms for potatoes on my chicken and they said no. I don't like that given how much we are paying for a good meal.Drinks: they offer a handful of strong signature drinks around 10-12 dollars each and of course beer and wine. They offer a Malbec that is to die for.Overall I think this place is a little overrated for my tastes. It's a good place to take out of town guests, but definitely not a regular place to go out to for me."

2015-11-25,3.5,"Raleigh, NC",Moonlight Pizza Company,"So Moonlight get's a little pricey for pizza...but I can't deny it is delicious. I don't looooove pizza like most, but I'm always persuaded by moonlight's Blue Moon pizza. It is pesto based, perfect amount of cheese and includes pine nuts! They also have great seasonal pies. Things like bbq chicken, an al pastor and other creative offerings.The real reason I'm always up for Moonlight is the chopped salad. For right around $10 you get a large, yummy, chopped salad with grilled chicken, bacon, avocado and gorgonzola. Easily big enough to share or a filling dinner for one. The servers are also always nice and attentive. I've never had a bad experience here."
2015-11-25,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Rockford,"Loved the comfort food we got here on a cold November evening. We went on a Monday night...bonus right there that they're open, as a good amount of restaurants in the downtown Raleigh area are closed Mondays. Note that the restaurant is on the second lever of the building - there is a door between two shops that is well marked and leads upstairs. We were quickly greeted and seated. For an early weeknight - it had a decent amount of people there. Monday nights are half priced drafts. Ended up getting good local beer. Dinner was shrimp n grits, a bowl of the soup of the day, which was a sweet potato bisque, and we got a large side of zucchini. The bisque was amazing. Not heavy but it was filling. And it was served hot, not just warm, the way soup should be served. The grits were creamy and shrimp was well cooked. I expected the zucchini to be like fried zucchini but it wasn't, which I was glad to discover. I think they sauté it in olive oil and melt a bit of parmesan cheese on top. We ordered a large but for two people if it's just a side I'd order a small. Good for a date night or night out with a friend. I saw a few tables of 4 but I'm not sure if they can accommodate really large parties, though they do have two rooms they could probably rearrange to do so. Parking on the street is typical of downtown.I would come back here. Definitely recommend!"

They ofter several variations of the cheesesteak so you can order it just how you like.The downside is they only offer chips as a side, no French fries. The restaurant is small but offers sit down seating. We usually get take out from here. If you're looking for a good cheesesteak- this is your place."
2015-11-25,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mo-Te Vietnamese Restaurant,"Great little place for inexpensive Vietnamese subs.  The reason for 4 (instead of 5) stars is because they are frequently out of certain types of meat for the subs so -1 for lack of consistency.  Otherwise, the Banh Mi is the best you can get in Raleigh (especially for the price range).  Have not tried the pho though."

They're always so prompt with food, the service is great, and they'll call you when you're ready to be seated rather than give you a buzzer. Not to mention, the beer is WICKED a good. I had moved down here a few months ago and tried their food pretty soon after, and was not disappointed. If you go, definitely try the garlic knots. You'll ward vampires off for days, but they're amazing."

2015-11-25,5.0,"Durham, NC",Shaba Shabu,"Still a one star review. I want to update this with some additional information. In my initial review, I had an issue with the way the sushi (BOGO) was billed. To quote my earlier review:""Came with a large party (10ish or so). Was told by the server that all the sushi would go on one tab but that they could easily split things up for us to pay individually. Ok. I order sushi as does one other person. The sushi is BYGO free. Standard.My rolls were 8.90 and 12.90. The other person's rolls were 6.90 each. Now, when I ordered I assumed I was paying for my 12.90 roll but my 8.90 was the free one. Nope. Not the case.They put all the sushi on one bill and then drop the cheapest. What this means is it's not about you and what you order but about how your group as a whole orders. I took the bill up front and asked to speak with a manager. I explained what our server told us. Manager basically says that the policy is the policy because it's the policy. And apparently justifies this by saying everyone else in town does it this way too.""I recently went to a different sushi restaurant with a part of 12. They also had BOGO sushi. Remembering my experience here, I asked our server how the BOGO would be done. I tried to explain how it had been billed at Shaba Shabu, and asked if this was how they did it. He said no. He explained that the sushi I ordered would be on my bill and my bill alone. So, when I ordered two rolls (each was about 15.00). My second roll was free regardless of what others at the table ordered.So this statement from the Shaba Shabu manager that everyone in town bills the way they do - questionable at best. Maybe some other places do - but not everyone."
2015-11-25,3.0,"Durham, NC",Despina’s Cafe,"I met a friend that lives on the other side of Raleigh here since it was a central place between us. I arrived a few minutes early and it was rainy and gross so I went ahead and got a cup of coffee. Service is done via a counter which is typical for a small shop like this. The coffee was OK. It was dispensed from a standard carafe and there was a station. It appeared to mainly be set-up for 'to-go' with everything prepackaged in single serving. Once my pal arrived we ordered some food. I got the breakfast croissant and asked for a small side of the Orzo Salad. They have a full sized portion but I explained that I just wanted a small side to try it with my breakfast croissant, maybe like half or 1/4 of the full sized portion? I think the guy taking the order was pretty confused at first but caught on and I think just charged me a few dollars for the side which was fine.  Both the Croissant and the Orzo WERE OUT OF THIS WORLD AMAZING. I would say overall I liked it- the food and baked goods are far too good for the format though. I would rather see this converted into more of a restaurant with table service. The current format lends itself more to of a coffee shop, but the decor and feel of the place wasn't very coffee shop esq- and I didn't get the impression that they sold much coffee based on the station. The food was amazing; I think the ambiance and set-up just felt strange to me."
2015-11-25,1.0,"Emmaus, PA",Godavari Indian Restaurant,"I was looking for some reasonably spicy food to clear out my head, and these guys fit the bill perfectly.  You know it's gonna be good when most of the (full) restaurant are Indian patrons.  We had the buffet, which didn't have a huge selection.  But everything was tasty, and I'm all for quality over quantity in a buffet.  The buffet wasn't so spicy I was sweating, but it was genuinely spicy.  So if you don't like spice, this is not the restaurant for you.  The buffet had four vegetable curries, four different chicken preparations, some chutneys, pakora, potato balls, four types of rice, naan, masala chai, and raita.  So like I said, not a large selection, but I had a bit of almost everything and I wanted seconds of them."
2015-11-25,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chubby’s Tacos,"Yum yum yum! I loved this place. I am fish taco addict and their grilled talapia tacos are to kill for. And for the price? You can't beat them! I've also tried their tacos al pastor and spicy carne asada both of which were also delicious. I love that they have an open salsa bar and I have, on more than one occasions, admitted to being a salsa whore. Their pico has always been fresh and just the right amount of spicy. The only thing I warn of there is steering clear of whatever the orange-colored sauce is. Kinda icky. It's a small joint but is kept very clean. The service is exceptional and very fast. I will absolutely be back for more!"

I was very satisfied with the tacos and the service.  The chips are pretty good but the salsa sucks, I spent like five dollars on queso and it they brought it to me in this tiny little cup so I was pretty disappointed. I would come again for taco Tuesday, though."

2015-11-25,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Capital Club 16,"I'm giving it 4 stars because I like the ambience and that it's downtown (close to where I live) but the missing additional star is because of our waiter, Ryan, who just didn't care about our table if 5. We went at 8pm on a Tuesday. We had a reservation but it wasn't fully packed anyway. We ordered drinks and the waiter came back to say they were out of the bottle of wine that was ordered. And a couple of food items. We wish he told us before we ordered. Anyway...The food was delicious. We ordered the pimento cheese and fig crostinis, the wedge salad and some people in the group got sandwiches and one got the farmer's market rice bowl. All awesome.Would definitely recommend. Parking can be tricking because it's just street parking. And I think any party larger than 6 is a bit difficult. But they do take reservations for that amount. Good for a date, after dinner drinks, night out with friends - nice vibe. Just wish the waiter we had cared."

2015-11-25,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gonza Tacos y Tequila,"Gonza is probably the greatest Mexican restaurant in the triangle. I know, I know, that's a big declaration, especially coming from someone who hasn't eaten there too often. It's not cheap and there's usually quite a wait; those two factors right there tend to keep me away from places. But, it's really good. They're also closed on Mondays.Stopped in last night for some takeout. Sat at the bar drinking a cold beer, while I waited for my order. Mexican Flag. $13. Three corn tortillas, one of each: steak with , chile de arbor sauce, chicken with Mexican cream, and paisa beans with cilantro and tomatillo sauce. They're each rich in their own unique flavor. Yes, the colors from the sauces on the enchiladas kinda look like the Mexican Flag colors. My dinner also came with a hefty serving of chips and salsa. The salsa is a bit thicker than I usually like it, but very good.Gonza is a great spot to have right next to Bottle Revolution 3 in Greystone Village on Lead Mine Road. Friends may have joined me with their Mexican goodness when we were grabbing drinks before. I envied their Mexican flags and have been craving it so was thrilled to have finally satiated that last night. The food and short service at the bar were so good that I might just have to become a regular..."

2015-11-26,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kimbap,"So I FINALLY made it over to Kimbap Cafe for my pre-Thanksgiving lunch and I was impressed. In its small space over at Seaboard Station you'll find a lot of style and taste in a good way. Kimbap's menu is described as Korean-inspired but it stays true to its roots. I tried the japchae with seared pork belly along with the dumplings (comped) which were both quite good. You can tell they use quality ingredients here, the dumplings had great skins and were filled with a nice gingery meat. And the japchae was nicely prepared with slivers of carrot, mushroom ears and a bit of wilted spinach (I think).Kimbap's space is nicely decorated and bright with full visibility into the open kitchen. So it's great to see the crew here working hard on your food including Kimbap's owner, Kim. I had met her at an earlier event and she's definitely committed to her craft. Is Kimbap traditional Korean? Probably not but it's still durn tasty and spins a bit off of traditional for the ITB crowd. So stop on by and give their modern Korean eats a whirl, you'll leave happy and full which is usually the goal when eating out!"

2015-11-26,4.0,"Indianapolis, IN",Aladdin’s Eatery,"This is my sister- and brother-in-laws' favorite restaurant so we went while visiting. They said it recently changed ownership and while they miss the old owners the new ones are also extremely friendly.We started with the hummus and the kibbie. The hummus wasn't my favorite but it was good. I wasn't a fan of the pita - it was very thin and crunchy more so than fluffy. The kibbie was excellent!My husband got the Loubie plate and he rates it 5/5 for the plate itself. But he says he was disappointed that he didn't have more choices to customize a vegetarian dish. Most things were rice + 1 option, and he would have liked to have had more options.I got the Shawarma Pitza. Great idea but if I knew the pita was so thin I probably would have went with something other than the Pitza. The shawarma had a great taste but the tahini sauce was a little heavy for me.Everything was a lot of food. It was a good value for the price. The menu is super expansive. It's a positive in that everyone can find something to eat but at the same time it also means a lot of the food is mediocre. But as a chain they have no control over parsing down their menu. Make sure to try some Lebanese beer or wine during dinner."
2015-11-26,5.0,"Charlotte, NC",Yard House,"Worst service I have gotten in a while. First we found a fruit fly in our beer after a one sip. Not the huge issue because it happens. The waitress than proceeds to get us a new half yard that is only half filled. At the end we noticed she charged us for two full drinks including the one with the fly. I've worked in the food industry before so I'm pretty understanding but this was just terrible service.  I actually like the food but with this kind of service, this place only deserves one star."

2015-11-26,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sullivan’s Steakhouse,"Where do I start. Today was Thanksgiving and we decided to eat out this year. Being that it was Thanksgiving what betterr to do than have turkey..right?  Just don't have it at Sullivams.Given that I'd heard good things about their steaks we thought we give it a try it was my first visit. I will give credit..the cheese steak egg rolls were pretty good the mushrooms were fabulous and the wait staff was great. Thanks Erin. Now to the main course. Upon biting into the turkey it was reminiscent of canned chicken ...the same kind I used to get in the Marine corps. It was clear to me that this was not sliced off a bird or that bird was an ostrich!! It was over salted, dry, nothing to write home about for sure.The presentation brought back memories of being out in the mud somewhere waiting for someone to sling hash on my plate.We find so few places in Raleigh that we would go back to. This isn't one of them pushing a price point of a 3-4 star restaurant with the quality of a 1-2 star.Frankly we probably could have gotten a better cooked meal at a homeless shelter at least we would know the turkey was actually hand carved from the bird...I know we saw them cooking them on tv today!Raleigh restaurants all of you need to review your own food and ask yourselves..would you serve this to your family? Restaurants in the area all complain that business is dropping off for one reason or another but not once do they ever consider that what they serve is not the value they perceive it to be. It's high time that we as the public stand up and refuse to accept mediocrity. Its not the amount of food but the quality. Stop serving food on par with high school lunch lines and charging $200 bucks for it. This certainly was not the value or quality I expected."
2015-11-26,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Pit,Always make a reservation.  This is where you bring out of town people.  It has everything people from out of town want - the whole southern barbecue with a story etc.  It's not a place you wander into.  But we actually go for Thanksgiving now which is the bomb!
2015-11-27,3.5,"Raleigh, NC",The Point at Glenwood,"I will never set foot in this place again. Our bill was hit with a $24 surcharge; non-taxable. When I politely asked our waitress what that was for, she had no idea. Next thing I know, the manager came over to our table and said, ""so you don't want to pay your bill!"". He couldn't explain what the charge was for; something about paying no tax to the ABC board?! Then a waiter came over and said it was a glitch in their system, and they couldn't really figure out what it was for, but that we still owed it. It was complete nonsense."
2015-11-27,4.5,"Raleigh, NC",Nashers Sandwich House,"What a great find.  I'd heard some good reviews about Nashers, and finally was able to find it next to Advance Auto Parts. I know, when you find it, you'll be like, ""I don't have high expectations."" The location is hidden from the mix at the Food Lion mall on Durant with it's mediocre Chinese food, sub shop, Chubby's Mexican, Bruster's Ice Cream, and Bojangles. And, you'll be wrong. The food is incredible. The sandwiches rival any bistro but at an affordable price. You may be tempted to simply slide over the soups in favor of the fries made with sea salt & Cracked black pepper served with Nashersauce, or the pimento mac and cheese, or the sweet potato tots.The chicken noodle soup is to die for. The broth was rich and flavorful with bits of chicken and vegetables. Just the right amount of seasoning, salt, pepper, thyme. Perfect. Now for my secret.  I'm not supposed to eat gluten so I expected that I couldn't get the soup without noodles. WRONG! They add the noodles separately, so you can simply order chicken soup. And let me tell you that Nasher's chicken soup truly feeds the soul. It's homemade and amazing. There's restaurant ""home-made"" and then there's truly homemade. This is truly ""homemade."" Next time someone in the family has a cold, it's where I'll go if I can't make my own.  The sandwiches are large - two people in my party brought half of theirs home. We have the herb chicken panini, roast beef melt and roasted pear grilled cheese.  Here's what we thought:  Herb chicken panini - definite hit - excellent flavor with the roasted peppers, basaltic onions, basil mayo really accentuating the fresh roast chicken. The mozzarella was unnecessary, but added chew and made sense for the hot sandwich.Roast Beef Melt - A++  The beef with roasted garlic-horseradish butter, carmelized onions delivered a perfect balance. The Swiss was an interesting cheese choice and a refreshing change from mozzarella.The Roasted Pear grilled cheese was a disappointment. The grilled pears added a terrific sweetness to the sandwich. The dried cranberries gave it added chew, and the honey crema also contributed to a slightly sweet sandwich. But, the choice of blue cheese is a great disservice to the sandwich. The tang didn't complement the flavors and swamped the sandwich like a taste tsunami. Choosing a mellower cheese would have made more sense. Even going with American would have been a better choice.  I'd love to try it with a goat cheddar. That would be exceptional - in my mind's eye.  (Are you listening Nashers? Hint, hint.)The french fries were cooked to perfection, crispy outside, soft inside. Right amount of salt. Bistro quality. The indoor dining at tables is rudimentary sandwich shop fare - tables for four with no frills. The drink bar has free lemon slices. The music is a good volume, and it has outdoor dining. My wish - that they put something up - preferably plants to better block the noise/view of Durant road and Advance Auto Parts. Small things, but when the food and price is that good, I had to come up with something.  They have cornhole set up for the kids to play while you wait for the food. Another + for thinking about families.Why I've fallen in love at first bite?  They have terrific gluten-free buns. With 4 people in my family who can't eat gluten - this is our newest top sandwich shop choice. The gluten-free buns are large, and not just store-bought Udi's. The flavor is good. The problem with gluten-free is always overcoming them being too coarse and too dry. The butter/spreads/melted cheeses, and grilling help incorporate moisture and softness into the rolls, so I would lean towards grilled sandwiches over cold ones. But, don't misunderstand me, the rolls are excellent. Go there before everyone else. That way you'll be able to say, ""I went there before it became famous and crazy popular."""
2015-11-27,3.0,"Fairfax, VA",510 Tavern,Happy hour review only but a great staff and great food.  They had great happy hour specials and gave us a killer car bomb cupcake.   Highly recommend!
2015-11-27,5.0,"Baltimore, MD",Stanbury,Delicious food and solid drinks. Recommend getting a few small plates to share. The food is local and trends to be on the heavier side. Their oyster options are always on point. Try the cocktails!
2015-11-27,5.0,"Seattle, WA",The Remedy Diner,Amazing food! Wonderful friendly fast service. Will for sure be back. Breath of fresh air!
2015-11-27,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Salt & Lime Cabo Grill,"Delicious, fresh and unique Baja Mexican fare! My good friend recommended this place to me and one day I was in the area and decided to give it a go. The restaurant is really nice inside and make sure to look up, there are some really cool lanterns. We started off with a free order of guac (Yelp deal) and some salsa. Both very good. I got the braised short rib tacos and my husband got the surf and turf burrito. Both were delicious!!!! Not your typical Mexican food. Very fresh, and black beans instead of refried. The margaritas looked fantastic, but I just stuck with an iced tea. I wish there was a location closer to us, like in Cary. Maybe one day they will open up a second location. Love their food and service!"
2015-11-27,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Plates Neighborhood Kitchen,"The Thanksgiving Charity Dinner at Plates was stellar. The three-course dinner included traditional turkey day fare as well as a few dishes not typically on the holiday table, and for every meal sold, Plates donated $20 to Stop Hunger Now. How awesome is that?Of the four starters, I chose the Sweet & Spicy Oysters prepared in a cornmeal batter. They were thinly coated with the cornmeal batter which gave great texture, and the honey, chili and aioli sauce enhanced the flavor perfectly. These were big, meaty, tender oysters. I could have eaten a meal of them!For my entrees, I chose Thanksgiving Turkey and Roasted Pork Loin. The turkey was moist and tender just like Mom makes. The pork loin was prepared with a sage and rosemary rub and bacon jus. The pork was a little salty for my taste, likely because of the bacon jus, but I typically keep my sodium intake low, so I'm probably more sensitive than most with saltiness.My sides were garlic and parmesan mashed potatoes, oyster stuffing (with whole oysters!), and roasted Brussels sprouts. Any time you put garlic and any cheese in mashed potatoes, you have my heart. These were smooth and creamy but still had a good, substantial consistency. The stuffing was mildly seasoned, which gave the oysters just the space they needed. The Brussels sprouts were roasted just to the point of being browned on top and didn't last long on the plate.Dessert. Sticky Toffee Pudding. OMD, if for no other reason, go to Plates for the Sticky Toffee Pudding. I'm fussy about my desserts, and honestly expected to eat a bite or two and push it aside. Oh no. I ate every last bit of this heavy, moist date cake covered with heavenly toffee sauce and served with whipped cream. Delicious.The bar manager suggested a glass of Madeira to compliment the dessert and he was spot on. The owners were lovely hosts who went from table to table introducing themselves, saying hello to friends, and making sure everyone was happy. From the time I called to make my reservation until I left with my belly full, it truly felt like a neighborhood kitchen.Well done Plates, well done!"
2015-11-27,4.0,"Cary, NC",Kimbap,So yummy. Came here with a Korean friend who was a bit unsure being that the menu is so modern but we were so pleasantly surprised. So good. We will be back.
2015-11-27,2.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Kadhai The Indian Wok,"If you like Indian food, live in the triangle and like trying new places - then this place is a must try. You can tell they use top quality ingredients. The best part is that the family who owns the restaurant is always very kind."

2015-11-27,4.0,"Knightdale, NC",Chubby’s Tacos,Our table ordered shredded beef tacos and a beef borrito. The tacos were amazing and the borrito looked delicious.

2015-11-27,4.0,"Pittsburgh, PA",Poole’s Downtown Diner,Best Mac and cheese I've ever had in my life! The short ribs were also killer! I'll be back to this place very soon!
2015-11-27,3.0,"Chagrin Falls, OH",Midtown Grille,I was there for Thanksgiving and it was the worst holiday meal I have ever eaten.   Overpriced at  $55 with a set menu and no flexibility to switch out mashed potatoes for sweet potatoes which was available for an additional  $7.  One person in our group got 7 roasted carrots while I  got 3 and another got 4...very inconsistent.   Stuffing was the equivalent of a cookie scoop! Turkey and ham was dry and for  $55 we each got a whopping 1  thin slice.  I had hair in my salad and the service was slow  (I had to stir my coffee with a  fork since the server was waiting for the decaf coffee that others ordered to brew before bringing the spoons out). I will not return because of my poor experience. Truly one Thanksgiving that I didn't over eat and not by choice.
2015-11-27,5.0,"Seven Lakes, NC",Big Al’s BBQ,"Absolutely awesome pork barbecue  in the middle of Carolina barbecue country.  Super quick service in a nice clean place.  This smallish establishment has it all, great food and fast service in a nice clean environment.  Not sure if Al's is a chain, but if not it should be.  Cant wait to go back!"
2015-11-27,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",First Watch,"First time to First Watch. Very cute decor. I noticed it didn't smell like food when I came in. Our sever explained they do not have friers, microwaves, everything is made fresh. Maybe that's why? In any case, one put off was not one but two glasses (water and coffee) had lipstick on them; and not from simply not clearing the table - they appeared ""clean"" otherwise. Not a total germaphobe I simply pointed it out and asked for new cups. On to the food; fresh as promised! If you want salty (or are used to it due to other places) you will need to add it. They lean towards healthier options which is nice, just keep that in mind when considering what you're craving. Our server was extremely pleasant and took care of us. Prices are fair,  I imagine I will try it again."
2015-11-27,4.0,"Merry Hill, NC",Sassool,"I rarely write reviews, but I could just not eat there without saying something.  It was my first visit, so I told the gentleman (owner/manager) behind the counter, and he was most helpful guiding me through the selection process.  He recommended the salmon over a curry rice.  I chose the tzatziki and quinoa salad as the sides.  The gentleman loaded me up with bread.  He came to my table later to make sure I did not need anything else.  The meal was absolutely delicious.  It was my first visit, but certainly will not be my last.  I give it 5 stars, no question about it."
2015-11-27,5.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Mitch’s Tavern,"If you want the best lunch in Raleigh, home cooked, natural ingredients, fast, super great value, go to Mitch's. I'm so addicted to Mitch's creations and the menu doesn't  ever change and doesn't have to. I recommend the Taco salad, Italian sub, the London broil sandwich and Barbecue sandwich. Everything is good anytime lunch or dinner when near NC State!"
2015-11-27,5.0,"Boulogne-Billancourt, France",Gonza Tacos Y Tequila,"I am from California, hard to find great Mexican food. Pescado tacos tonight were awesome. Queso was amazing. My husband had the quesadilla and loved it. What we noticed most here was the EXCELLENT SERVICE! The staff all worked together to make sure our visit was to our satisfaction. Great work guys!!! Joseph rocks- we are so happy this place is here, we will be back.... often!"
2015-11-27,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sitti,"Sitti is one of my favorite Mediterranean/Lebanese Restaurants ever and hands down the best in Raleigh.  I was born in Doha, Qatar and have been exposed to some of the best foods in this area all of my life (now, almost 31 years old) and Sitti brings it.  5 Stars all around."
2015-11-27,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Station,Yum! One of our favorite spots in the entire Triangle. The pink peppercorn vinaigrette is the best salad dressing I've ever had. Hands down!
2015-11-27,4.0,"Charlotte, NC",Joule Coffee,"I had the Huevos Rancheros and it was outstanding! Love the atmosphere! Love the single bar seating in the window units. Don't love the family long table down the center, but it's not horrible. You get 4 of 5 for charging me 3x for an ice tea black unsweetened at 2.50 or so. C'mon please offer free ice tea black unsweet refills for free!"
2015-11-27,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Rise Biscuits & Donuts,"Plain bacon or sausage biscuit will set you back $3.35.  Egg?  Add $1.25.  Cheese adds another $.85.  So i bit thinking that a $5 biscuit would be either the best i ever tasted or huge.  It was neither.  Donuts seemed pricey as well, but don't think ill be back to roll the dice again.  VALUE people.  You have to be better than Bojangles at that price point.  The Brugers Bagels that had that address before you had much better breakfast fare for slightly less $$, so adjust your thinking or you will be a memory."
2015-11-28,3.5,"Virginia Beach, VA",The Flying Biscuit Café,"Any restaurant with the word ""biscuit"" in its name had better crank out a tasty, fluffy biscuit that makes every southerner and wannabe southerner swoon like a love-struck teenager.Thankfully, the Flying Biscuit Cafe delivers on that biscuit. You don't even have to order them. They come to the table complimentary with a side of apple butter for slathering purposes. They were delicious. Every crumb was scarfed up by our party of seven.They were so good that I decided to continue chasing arteriosclerosis by ordering the 'Southern Biscuits Benedict', which is chicken sausage gravy over another splayed open biscuit with two eggs on top. If you are an aficionado of the biscuit and gravy arts then this dish is for you. No need to try the grits or the fluffy, buttermilk pancakes, which received nods of approval from my dining companions.The only criticism I can throw at this place is that they are too popular for the size of their restaurant. We had to wait almost forty minutes for a table. And the flow of customers never ceased. It was just as busy when we left as it was when we arrived.Just be prepared to wait."
2015-11-28,2.0,"Wake Forest, NC",Serena Sicilian Influenced Cucina,"Being from the Binghamton/Endicott area, I was really wanting to like this place, like Tony's in Endicott.  However, we were very disappointed in almost all the food choices tonight.  Our appetizer, calamari fritti, was very tough and rubbery and tough to chew.  The sauces were good and the breading was excellent, but the calamari itself was very tough.  My kids both ordered pizzas, which were really good, but they were brought out about 20 minutes ahead of the adult entrees (I realize the pizzas could come out ahead of regular meals, but 20 minutes was a bit too much variance) and the kids were done eating by the time the adult entrees arrived.  My wife ordered the Rigatoni Viviana and the pasta was undercooked, not al-dente, but a bit hard and chewy.  My mother-in-law ordered the twin-pork chops east-harlem style, and said they were just so-so and didn't care for the cannellini beans and roasted vegetables.  She's usually not one to complain or leave most of her meal, but she did this time.  I ordered the NY strip medium-rare and it was cooked to medium, and grey-ish and cold in the middle and had no seasoning.  The farro also had little to no taste.  I rarely don't finish a meal, but this was a terrible steak that I couldn't eat.  I wish I had gone to Outback next door!  Being still hungry, I had a slice of my kids pizza, and it was very good.  Maybe as a pizza restaurant Serena could excel, but their entrees were below-average Italian dishes."
2015-11-28,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Despina’s Cafe,"This is a decent coffee shop. They serve sandwiches and baked goods there that are good, but not amazing. The staff is pretty friendly. The wifi works fine. The coffee is good but not amazing. If you're heading over there to work, note their business hours are rather abbreviated. This is perhaps one of the bigger disappointments of the place. It's not uncommon to be the only patron there for an hour or more before seeing someone else come in. Even the staff may disappear to the back of the building for long stretches, making the place an eerie sort of lonely place. This is a Good coffee shop (3 stars), borderline Very Good (4 stars). If they'd have longer hours and a bit more zing in the menu, I'd offer a 4 star rating."
2015-11-28,1.0,"Highland Beach, FL",The Players Retreat,Great burger with great home made chips. Fun place and foid was delicious!!We were told this place has been around for some time and is a Raleigh must... so glad it was right around the corner from where we were staying.
2015-11-28,5.0,"Oceanside, CA",Bloomsbury Bistro,"Had the beef bourgogne; it was fantastic, incredibly tender and flavorful. The waiter (Dave, I think?) was very good, and very responsive to our (nitpicky) needs. Highly recommended."
2015-11-28,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Lilly’s Pizza,"Rating only base on pizza pick up--they gave us the wrong order. We waited so long for it, when we found out after opened the box, we just don't want to waste the time to change it. The five point vege pizza was better than the other pizza we got incorrectly(we ordered Hawaiian Punch), and I don't like the sour pepper on it."
2015-11-28,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Big Ed’s North,"Shameful disappointment...with food, staff and manager. My daughter and I have ate at Big Ed's downtown for many years. She used to sit on his lap at his special table...she is now 24 if that tells you how long.  My experience at the North location was a shameful representation of both southern food and southern hospitality. Our waitress was slow and rude, never refilled our tea glasses without us asking. We received more service from the various waitresses we could flag down as they walked past us. Both of our meals were cold. My daughter got the french toast & sausage. The french toast was basically stale bread toasted with a little cinnamon sugar, far cry from french toast. Dry and tasteless. The sausage patty was edible but cold. I had some kind of meat shaped deep fried ""beef"" patty with what tasted like watered down pre-packaged onion gravy. Truly unidentifiable...reminded me of school cafeteria. Green beans were cold and clearly from a can. The mashed potatoes were lumpy, yet still the best thing we had to eat. The ""sweet potato cake"" made us laugh..for real. She handed me a sad small bowl with what truly looked like a tablespoon of crumbs in a bowl held together by a little confectioner sugar icing. At least we got a laugh! I surely would have complained about temperature and taste, if anyone had ever came back to check on us. At checkout I noticed the bill was wrong. The cashier tells us she doesn't know the prices so she will have to go check with the waitress. What!? You WORK here! I ate here one time and I know the price, besides there is a menu right in front of you!! She then tells us it is because the cashiers are not trusted to make price adjustments, the waitresses have to do that. Wow! Yet, these people handle the cash? Hmmmm....  She then gets a young male manager who argues with me that the price is correct. At that point I told him it didn't really matter, it was a difference of $1.39 and no worries...I will not be back anyway!! He said nothing and handed me the check. Some manager. I don't care what the issue is when a customer tells you they will not return to your establishment you should take the time to ask why and resolve the situation. Big Ed would surely be disappointed in this location."
2015-11-28,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",State Farmers Market Restaurant,"So yummy! And the choices ... oh my!I met a peer here for lunch, around 11 AM on a Friday. Good thing we got there when they did, because by 11:30, the place was packed & there was a long line to get seated.The resturaunt is very ""homey"" & welcoming & true NC country decorated. Employees all wear overalls.We had a very attentive waiter. He was great! Very friendly. I got a fried flounder special, with cole slaw & mashed potatoes & dessert was banana pudding. Our meal came with hushpuppies & biscuits. It was way more food than I could eat, so thankfully a ""to go"" box came to the rescue. The meal was delicious!Prices are reasonable, but parking is not."
2015-11-28,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kai Sushi and Sake Bar,"When it's good, it's good. I've had mixed experiences here. One time I was held hostage over 30 minutes while they sorted out problems with their credit card processing. They had no backup method of accepting credit cards, which had me and some other diners chomping at the bit to leave.Usually the food is very good, though. I really appreciate the mixture of Korean and Japanese fare. Be warned, for what it is, I think it's on the expensive side. Tokyo House is going to be more reasonable as sushi goes. Seoul Garden has better Korean food for a better price. For that reason, I don't end up eating here as often as I might like.For some reason, service is better inside than out. Shame; I like their patio. But the servers seem reluctant to check on outdoor diners if they don't have to.I don't think they've got any concept of lunch portions, either, which might be why it's too expensive to eat lunch here.Be warned that there is no WiFi here, and they seem to be in a Sprint dead zone.Still... it's very good food. Definitely check it out. The sushi seems pretty trustworthy. And I really like the bibimbap here."

2015-11-28,4.0,"Rome, NY",Thai House,We had ordered take out and one of the meals was left out. So we called and returned to the restaurant to pick up the food. The owner was so generous and apologized multiple times. She even threw in some extra spring rolls for the inconvenience. Such great customer service and delicious food!!!
2015-11-28,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Ni Asian Kitchen,"I lived in San Francisco for some years and this is the type of restaurant that would thrive there among the residents who seek great food in a neighborhood environment. Quiet, well decorated, friendly and down to earth. This is a ""secret spot"" that you want to have. The food cannot be fresher. The execution of the dishes is far better than the chains. I have been there twice and had to write this up."
2015-11-28,5.0,"Highland Beach, FL",Poole’s Downtown Diner,"This restaurant was my sons choice for his birthday dinner. While we had to wait over half an hour for a table, we were pleased we could have drinks and sit comfortably while we waited. It's interesting to have to read blackboards for your meal and drinks but it shows that things are always updated and fresh.I loved the wines.. some very unusual ones and all interesting. Prices are a bit high but I didn't mind for a special night out.The apps we had were all fantastic. Steak tartare, a rabbit liver pate, beets & avocado salad and a pimento cheese spread. For mains, 3 of us had the short ribs and one had a rabbit pot pie plus a side of brussel sprouts (best I ever had), sweet potato, Mac & cheese. For some dumb reason, we also ordered bread with butter (that we still managed to eat and was delicious too!) Needless to say, we could not finish it all. Not cheap but a really great night out. Happy I had a 1 1/2 mile walk afterwards."
2015-11-28,5.0,"Greensboro, NC",Thai House,"Dropped in this spot today for a quick late lunch break while shopping in the area. Very clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. Was in the mood for soup so I got the Tom Kah Talay (Shrimp) and Thai Sticky Rice with Mango. Both were exceptionally good. I also got the Thai Spicy Basil Chicken and a side of fried rice to go. The fried rice might be the best I've ever eaten. The Spicy Basil Chicken was ok but not stellar, or spicy, although the waitress did give me some spicy chili paste to spice it up myself. Overall it was a good experience and I will prolly go back when in the area just for the fried rice and sticky rice. Plus, I'm new to this part of NC and have yet to find a Thai place I love."
2015-11-28,5.0,"Washington, DC",Tasty 8’s,"I remember getting excited about this late night gourmet hotdog place. My buddy who lives in Raleigh was always raving about it. However when visiting this place came to fruition, there was one word to describe it: meh.Walking up to the place, they have a sidewalk window which gives it a chill fast food vibe. However since it was cold-er (November), the window was closed. Inside, there's ample seating which is unusual for a hotdog place but I guess since it's ""gourmet"" they give off that vibe. Going to the menu, it was relatively simple with ~8 options for hotdogs along with sides and shakes. I didn't get a shake but I heard they were really good (but then again, I heard this place was really good), but I digress. Anyways going to the food:+Chicky Chicky Banh Mi - Being asian, I love banh mi, so I went with this full dog and while it tasted pretty good (I was also drunk), the hotdog was way overcooked. Even the mayo sauce couldn't revive this dog.+Corndog Whisperer - Full size all the way. This thing was gigantic, however I think the employees tried to get our food out fast and ended up delivering an undercooked corndog. Biting into it, the batter was still raw near the hotdog, so we ended up stripping the corndog to just the dog.+Belgian Frites - This sounds foreign and fancy but don't be fooled, it's just regular fries. I think this was the best part of the meal. Fries were cooked and seasoned well and tasted really good with the green pesto aioli.Definitely got some good snapchats out of the whole experience but as for recommending it. I would say only go here if this is your only option. Subway is just down the street. Just Sayin."
2015-11-28,5.0,"Pacifica, CA",Ole Time Barbecue,As good as any bbq. I have travelled the country trying styles but nothing beats east carolina vinegar base pork. The pork here is moist and tender.

VERY pleased!Boo & I had a great first experience (he's been to the other location many times) here. Wait staff is quick & attentive. My sausage & cheese omelet, grits & toast have been perfect both times (dine in & ""to go). Plenty of seating inside & the menu has many choices. Prices are reasonable, especially for the portion size.Parking can be troublesome, more so on the weekends. Get there early or you'll have a wait."

The Asian couple behind me was seated immediately.It took a long time for me to really feel like coming back after that, but everyone told me how great the food is here and that I should really give it another go.The food is really great here. :) I'm hoping that my one bad experience was an outlier, and it was long enough ago that it's entirely possible the guy who snubbed me no longer works there.This place is in a DUMP of a shopping center but don't let the location fool you; this is my second favorite Korean restaurant in the Raleigh-Durham area (first being Vit Goal Tofu)."
2015-11-28,4.0,"Cary, NC",Capital Club 16,"Man, I wanted to five star this place. Or four star, even. I really did. There's something so charming about it from the outside, especially at night . And maybe - just maybe - my experience can be chalked up to the fact that it was the Tuesday of Thanksgiving week and the employees were just over it. But man, were they over it. My party of five - of all pretty established local bloggers, photos and reviewers, mind you - ordered a cheese plate to start, and attempted to order a bottle of wine and a few cocktails. The first few bottles we selected, they were out of. They were out of a couple of beers as well (must have had some party the weekend before?!) Whatevs, we weren't going to hold it against them. We finally landed on a bottle and all was well. I ordered the shnitzel sandwich with fries. It arrived with a salad instead. At this point our waiter had all but checked out completely. We finally got someone else's attention and they brought us fries. Our waiter never apologized or acknowledged the mix up. He was extremely blasé about serving us... Messed up our bill, was not apologetic of that either. All in all, food was good, ambience was good, but service really soured the experience for all of us. Too bad... They'd have had five more fans otherwise!"
2015-11-28,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Capital Club 16,"It took my WAY too long to try Capital Club 16. Finally had dinner there with friends and it immediately became clear that this will become a regular spot.It's a small, intimate, and popular restaurant. Not sure if they take reservations, but it's definitely a good idea to check. The atmosphere reminded me of a quaint European restaurant.I had the mac and cheese, which was delicious. FYI: it came with A LOT of caramelized onions on top. This was a surprise because it's not listed on the menu. Two others in my party had burgers and we loved all the apps and entrees we tried. Looking forward to coming back soon."
2015-11-28,3.0,"Garner, NC",Bella Monica,"Went there last night. Been to many Italian places. The flavor and thickness of the sauce is very good and loved the taste. I ordered Eggplant Parmesian. This is the first Italian place I've been to that they didn't bread the eggplant when you get Eggplant Parmesian. There was not much pasta and hardly any cheese. Tons of unbreaded pieces of eggplant and the dish was overwhelmed with sauce. Too much sauce in my opinion. The atmosphere is okay, not the greatest, not the worst. The wait staff was very very nice. The bread was different, I enjoyed it. The salad was ""ok"". I have had better Italian but I've also had worse. If they asked me I would say bread the eggplant, add much more cheese and a little more pasta."
2015-11-28,4.0,"Ferndale, MI",The Flying Biscuit Café,"The Meggsican Wrap is the worst breakfast burrito I've ever had, took 2 bites and couldn't stomach more.  I realize that is a strong statement, but the truth.  Grits are okay.  They serve you 2 biscuits right away which is nice but the apple/cranberry butter is lame! Service at the bar was sub par, had to shout for coffee refills and glasses of water."
2015-11-28,4.0,"Fayetteville, NC",Seoul Garden Restaurant,I walked into the restaurant and the smell of the food just made me stop in my tracks. They were so rich and aromatic I knew we chose the right restaurant. I usually am not a kimchee person but all of the appetizers were amazing. We ordered the Bulgogi and JapChae (first time there so I wanted to be safe) and it was really great. The service was especially friendly and the atmosphere inviting. I love this place. When we visit Raleigh again this will definitely be a stop.
2015-11-28,5.0,"Cary, NC",Raleigh Times Bar,"Rude. We stopped by for a quick bite to eat and beer and the staff threw us out before closing time. The bartender was rude, the bouncers were yelling at everyone by 1:30 and before 2 they were in our faces pushing us out. We are just a quiet couple having a beer. I watched the bully bouncers laugh and put a girl out on the street alone because she had her head down- no one bothered to ask if she was okay or ensure she'd make it home.  I'll never go back. I've been going here since I moved here in 2008, I am extremely disappointed and saddened by the disgusting people who work there. This is not how you treat people Raleigh Times, you are a disgrace to Raleigh and I will never again recommend you."
2015-11-28,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sassool,"This is basically Neomonde. It opened under that name. I'm not sure why the name changed, but nothing else about the place seems different since the name change. Mostly this is going to be a cafeteria style eatery. The food is really fresh and delicious. They will also tempt you as you're waiting in line to pay with a display case full of delicious baked goods and sweet confections. Give in to the temptation. It's good stuff.They'll ask if you want some fresh pitas with your order. Yeah, it's an upsell, but it's a good one. This is the source of the best pitas in town, and when you buy day old pitas from another store, they came from here when they were still fresh. Pro tip: check out their grocery section, with their bulk herbs get yourself a package of za'atar herbs, put a generous amount of za'atar on a small plate with your best olive oil and drag your fresh Sassool pitas through that herbal sludge. Thank me later.This is one of the real gems of north Raleigh, and it's completely unpretentious. Definitely come check it out. If you're trying to eat light, their salads are AMAZING."
2015-11-28,5.0,"Carrboro, NC",The Fiction Kitchen,The food was amazing. I ate the 'chicken' and Waffels. There was so much flavor in everything! I will definitely be back!
2015-11-28,2.0,"Cary, NC",Trophy Brewing Company,Ordered a cheese pizza before going to show. After waiting over 30 minutes had to cancel order because we still had no food. When asked to cancel was told still had five minutes. I don't understand how it takes 35 minutes to make a cheese pizza. My review isn't on food. The service wasn't good either.
2015-11-28,4.0,"Edison, NJ",Gino’s Pizza,Gino's Pizza brings me right back home to New Jersey and I consider myself very fortunate to live so close to this pizza joint! Highly recommend this place.
2015-11-28,1.0,"Cary, NC",Raleigh Times Bar,"Happened upon the Times Bar while we were wondering around downtown Raleigh one afternoon. We stopped in at a bit of an odd time, but there was still a decent crowd inside. Always a good sign for a restaurant. The bar has an eclectic look inside that takes full adantage of displaying how old the building is. Even with the crowd, the bartender was extremely attentive and food/beverages were served quickly. We split a bratwurst meal and the fish and chips meal. Both were great options. The bratwurst was served with homemade potato chips on the side that were absolutely killer. Both food and atmosphere were a homerun.Due to the location and the food/beer selections, I think the night scene would be pretty good as well. Great find."
2015-11-28,1.0,"Old Bridge, NJ",Trophy Brewing Company,I am from NJ and I have missed the amazing pizza since I moved to Raleigh in August. This place is awesome!!! They have all kinds of cool pizzas on the menu but they will make you a regular pepperoni pizza if you ask for it. Their beer is also really good. And the staff! They are all friendly and attentive...even though it was a super busy night when we went there. I highly recommend this place! We will definitely be back!
2015-11-28,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Standard Foods,"We stopped by with friends for drinks and small plates, and everything is good! The butchers board has all the flavor and texture we expected, and the selection of the meat is good, too. The chicken wings has a kick, and it also has a smoky flavor to do which remind me of duck confit, a nice surprise there. Cocktails are also great, the ambience is cozy yet romantic. We would like to come back for a full meal sometimes."
2015-11-28,5.0,"Gainesville, FL",Glenwood Grill,"Food and service were good overall. Our server recommended lobster pot pie, but it left something to be desired and felt a little kitschy, honestly. We also had a cup of she crab soup which was superb. For our entrees we ordered the chickpea crusted salmon and the catfish, both of which were phenomenal. The wine selection was also plentiful and their dessert menu looked good (though we were too stuffed to order any). Great little unassuming restaurant."
2015-11-28,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Standard Foods,"So most of the time when a new upscale restaurant opens up that can be on the pricey side and crowded, well I tend to let others work out the expensive kinks and wait for the roar to die down.  But when they happen to be open for lunch too (and on a Saturday, no less), well I wasn't about to say no when Sis suggested trying it out for lunch.We showed up around 1:00 on this sunny Saturday afternoon and were led to one of the communal tables where there were a couple other couples finishing up their lunches. Instantly loved the open ambiance, the variety of types of seating (bar area looks nice and comfy I noted for future reference).  Although it wasn't loud when we were there, we could see how it could get that way if it was super crowded. Gal Server was excellent the whole time. Started us off with water (no ice...hate this ""trendy"" way to serve water, but hey a Duck Rabbit Stout on tap made me forget about it).  After asking a few questions, we decided to share two salads.  The first to arrive was our fave:  Turnip & Apple Salad with excellent Parmesan, Ramp Vinegar with Savory Granola.  We both loved it.  Refreshing, perfectly seasoned, wonderful balance of flavors and textures.Second was the Smoked Trout Tartine, which was an open-faced Sandwich consisting of four triangles of Boulted Rye, topped with the Smoked Trout that had been mixed with Maple Creme Fraiche & Horseradish, with Thin Apple Slices for texture.  Delicate, creamy, just the right amount of smokiness...excellent! It was topped off with a few salty crunchy potato chips. Mmmmm. Next up, we shared the Radicchio Salad, which had beautiful Beets, Bacon, Spicebush & Pecans.  Spicebush, by the way is a type of vinegar.  This salad was so pretty (see pic), but while delicious, stood out slightly less in flavor than the other two dishes.  I never tasted bacon, for instance.  It was light & delicate and a true work of art though.We were both comfortable at this point, but hey, when in Rome...we figured we should really try the Smoked Cocoa Nib Panna Cotta, Escazu Chocolate Mousse, Buckwheat Specaloos, Toasted Meringue.  Oh wow!  Talk about the perfect balance of textures and flavor...a PERFECT dessert.  Just sweet enough. Just rich enough.  I still don't know what Specaloos are, but there was some good crunch going on!What a perfect lunch for two Sisters to share!  And when it came time to split the bill...not bad there either.  $45 (before tip) for four wonderful items and my $6 Draft...well worth every penny for this kind of quality, freshness and expertise!And if all that isn't perfect enough, there's the store part of it....organic spices, wonderful produce, amazing looking stocks and soups...fresh meats and vegetables.  I could go on and on, but instead I'll just go back and back.Note for Husband:  they do have a great looking burger and fries for $12!"
2015-11-28,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gonza Tacos y Tequila,"I'm a huge fan of Gonza, and apparently so is everyone else in north Raleigh. Getting in can be tough. But once you've tried it, it'll be no mystery why. The food is so fresh and tasty. But before you pick something off the menu, make sure and ask your server if there are any specials. They'll often offer something special and seasonally fresh."
2015-11-28,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gonza Tacos y Tequila,My family can count on THIS gonza every single time I promise it's so good! The waiting is extremely good and omg the manager there is so nice he comes to me and my sister and says hi!!!
2015-11-28,2.0,"Norfolk, VA",Rise Biscuits & Donuts,By far the best biscuits and donughts I have had in awhile.  Sure it's pricy but the review is about food not the price.  Wait time for when we arrived on Saturday at 10 was about 5 min in line and 5 mins for the food.  The people were awesome I would definitely come here again.  They have a side window where you can see how they cook the food or make the donughts I would recommend it to anybody.  It is pricy like I said.
2015-11-28,2.0,"Old Bridge, NJ",Wicked Taco Raleigh,This place was cool. I didn't love the potatoes in my taco...but I'm glad I tried it and I don't have to order it that way next time. It was a nice taco place but a tad pricey. Definitely try the homemade cookies. I have no idea what is in them but they were insanely good! It's not a place that I crave but they are good quality and have really nice people working there.
2015-11-28,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",42nd Street Oyster Bar & Seafood Grill,Always quality. Love the freshness and tastiness of the food. Good service and a willingness to be flexible. Finding a table can be tricky during prime hours.
2015-11-29,4.0,"Cary, NC",Mura,"I'll still eat here, but I feel like Mura has gone downhill. I ordered some Mochi filled with ice cream and was disappointed that some of them were expired. Very chewy and tough. Although the quality of Salmon was good, the presentation as a roll was lacking. My Crunchy Salmon Roll and even my Spider Roll fell apart. It was wrapped so poorly. Staff were okay, but not very attentive in drinks after delivering food. Their deals are good though!"
2015-11-29,4.5,"Chapel Hill, NC",Taza Grill,"Walked in a random afternoon and am so glad I found this place. They offered suggestions, samples and showed me their options. Got a Greek salad with lamb, which came with hummus and pita. I don't usually eat the pita bread from restaurants but this was great and I also don't usually go for tzatsiki sauce but their's was also very good. The salad mix I got was very oily, so I would suggest asking for any dressing on the side. When I got back and if you ever order to go, I would suggest asking for all sauces on the side. We also bought some of the Tazza seasoning which has been great. Please try their lamb!"
2015-11-29,4.5,"Raleigh, NC",J Betski’s,"Delicious. Came here for a family lunch. We all ordered different dishes off the lunch menu and were very pleased. I made a reservation beforehand and we were seated immediately. It is deceivingly small inside, so I suggest getting a reservation during obviously busy mealtimes. We tried the beer, food, and dessert. All were amazing. Our waiter was friendly and attentive, and we will defiantely be going back."
2015-11-29,5.0,"London, United Kingdom",Calavera Empanadas And Tequila,"Simply perfect! Soft crust, good filling, well roasted vegetarian and meat empanadas. The price is reasonable, cocktails are awesome, ambience is cozy and lit up, Young crowd and nice downtown city view with occasional view of the trolley pub! :D great place for a date as well as for a small group of friends."
2015-11-29,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",J Betski’s,"Very, very good. Very small inside but good food. I've been here for lunch and for dinner - I can say dinner is the best. Lunch isn't bad, just not as good as dinner and not as many options.We started with the Potato and Cheese Pierogies - love them! Would absolutely recommend! For lunch I had the special - a reuben burger with fries. It was juicy and cooked just as I ordered it. Fries were very good. Nothing to complain about but I'd try something else my next time back for lunch.Service was ok. It took a little long to get our bill but food came out in a reasonable time and everything was correct.In summary, would absolutely go for dinner, lunch is up for debate."
2015-11-29,4.0,"Cary, NC",Soo Café,Great Soy Garlic wings! It is so different and delicious! Beware though that they only give you radishes that come with it only upon request.
2015-11-29,5.0,"Cary, NC",Saint Jacques,"The perfect mixture of deliciousness and interesting presentation! The menu changes a lot here, but I love whatever they offer each time I come by! Great staff in an intimate setting!"
2015-11-29,5.0,"Cary, NC",Garland,"Dinner is on the pricey side of things, so take note. The Birds Nest appetizer was good but super crumbly from what I'm use to. Beautiful presentation though! If you go for the Lamb Curry, ask for extra whipped coconut cream. It's more salty as opposed to savory. Garland is a cool place to go if you and your friends want to share the price of meals though!"
2015-11-29,5.0,"Cary, NC",Busy Bee Cafe,Busy Bee has the creamiest Mac and Cheese ever! So glad I came here. They also have The Hive next door! Very intimate and cozy there!
2015-11-29,1.0,"Littleton, CO",Ole Time Barbecue,"Ended up doing takeout and got the shredded pork and ribs. Soooo delicious. Had the collard greens and beans. Surprisingly I absolutely loved the collard greens. Others ate the hush puppies. Apparently they are to die for as they dipped them in butter containers as they ate them (like you dip drench fries in ketchup), but I wouldn't know. Ribs had great flavor and the meat just fell off the bone. The shredded pork was in a vinegar based sauce, a BBQ style frequently found on this side of North Carolina.Would recommend you try this place out if you haven't yet!"
2015-11-29,1.0,"Berkeley, CA",Winston’s Grille,"The quality of the food was EXTREMELY lousy for the price. I ordered the baby back ribs and honestly, I have not had worse. It was a cheap cut of meat drenched in cheap, overly sweet supermarket BBQ sauce. It was the kind of meal you expected to pay $12 at a cheap dive -- not $25 at an upscale restaurant. My friend had the rotisserie chicken. It too was utter crap. The dry, haphazardly seasoned, rotisserie chickens at Whole Foods taste better. And the collard greens were awful! Bland and tasteless. The food needs good chefs in the kitchen and pronto. And whoever is their kitchen manager is clearly buying cheap cuts of meat to cut corners on the cost of food.      That said, the decor and service were both excellent. The ice cream was superb. I might come back for a pint of butter pecan -- but seriously, the rest of the food leaves so much to be desired."
2015-11-29,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Seoul Garden Restaurant,"I've been here a few times now and every time I come the servers are friendly and the food is authentic and delicious. It isn't cheap, but the beef bulgolgi and bimbimbap dolsot bowls are both excellent choices. I also love the assortment of appetizers they bring to the table - top notch kimchi and other pickled veggies! We want to come back and actually use the bbq tables, but to do so you must have at least two people interested in cooking. It's definitely on our bucket list.Great place for meat eaters and vegetarians alike!"
2015-11-29,4.0,"Atlanta, GA",Sassool,"Oh wow...  this is really fun and trendy med food. Don't be food by its a - la - carte style, because the food is just simply super fun and amazing. It might not be super authentic mediterranean, but it is super flavorful and well made. Oh and you can add Southern touch to it with sweet tea. We went in the evening, so there was even life music! Super exciting.Order the mince pies (more like good quality pizzas!) - they were delicious. Any hummus dish is also awesome.The only reason this place didn't get a 5 because the live music was a little bit overly loud and awkwardly placed."
2015-11-29,4.0,"Cary, NC",Ajisai Japanese Fusion,"Sushi here is so good! They also have lots of lunch specials. If you're a student, ask about the discount they have! Beautiful place to be in and high quality fish! They have Japanese sodas, Ramune and great cocktails. Try their Miso soup with Enoki mushrooms, because it is savory without being overwhelming. The Spicy Crunchy Salmon Roll and the Peanut Avocado Roll is money every single time! You must eat here!!!"
2015-11-29,4.0,"Knightdale, NC",Bella Monica,"We finally tried Bella Monica last night, and while the service was wonderful and the atmosphere very nice, the food was just ok.The bread and oil they bring to start is very good, and you can tell it's homemade. The assorted bruschetta were also quite nice. The salads that came with our meal were very dry. I could not detect a drop of dressing on my house salad. My partner had the Cesar, which had detectable dressing, but still dry. The Porchetta pork was spectacular. Well seasoned, juicy, flavourful...just perfect. The sides for the dish were just not good. The fennel au gratin was greasy and not at all appetizing. The texture was so mushy and off-putting. It was literally just shaved fennel drenched in cheese. Adding a layer of potatoes for texture/contrast would have improved the dish immensely. The greens were too simple. They were too aldente and lacking in flavor.My partner had the Chicken Parm, and it was fine. The portion was generous, with loads of chicken, sauce, and cheese. The sauce tasted nice, but a bit on the thin side for our liking. We finished with the ricotta cheese cake, and neither of us really liked it. It was not very sweet, and had way too much zest. The citrus flavour was all we could taste. The texture was also not the most appealing. Very mealy and gritty.Maybe our expectations were too high based on the amazing reviews and multitude of awards given to Bella Monica. Maybe we just didn't order the right dishes. Unfortunately, I don't think we'll be returning to find out. The dishes are too expensive to risk having such a mediocre experience."
2015-11-29,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Centro,"My first experience with Centro was during a Raleigh Food Tour. We were impressed and definitely wanted to come back for the full experience! The service was amazing - our dining companions were vegan and the server was incredibly accommodating and made several suggestions.My husband and I will eat pretty much anything, so we asked the server for his suggestion and went with the enchiladas. You get 3 (chicken, steak, bean) all topped with different sauces. They were quite delicious. We will definitely be back!"
2015-11-29,5.0,"Cary, NC",Flying Burrito,I absolutely love the El Cuco and the Incan Tacos here! Extremely flavorful and all for a slim price! Add on the Pineapple Mango Salsa with your chips and it is a done deal! :) Cool scenery also! I must go back!
2015-11-29,5.0,"Creedmoor, NC",Relish Café & Bar,"Great ambiance, interesting and different menu choices, this little gem is tucked away in a busy strip mall. We have been here twice for dinner. Be prepared to wait for a table though. They always have a list that moves moderately fast. You can spend that time sitting at the bar, if you can get a seat. They have a nice, but overpriced wine list. They also have a full bar, and an attentive bartender. There is comfortable outdoor seating. The hostesses and waitstaff are BUSY, so you may feel a little rushed to eat and get out, or somewhat ignored. It is hit or miss. I would recommend this place to friends, but only if they had nowhere else to be."
2015-11-29,5.0,"Holly Springs, NC",Firebirds Wood Fired Grill,"Awesome meal for five last Saturday night around 6pm. Seated promptly from reservation. Med rare 14oz prime rib was tremendous. Consistent pink, warm, and so tender. Au juis was nice,as was their horsey sauce. Baked potato well above average. Other meals that were also highly enjoyed, were the meatloaf, sesame salmon, chicken salad and a filet mignon, I believe. Deserts were superb, although I prefer a less tart, more sweet key lime pie. Service, though a bit hurried, was very good. I received too many soft drink refills before I could request a water. Have been twice before and this was the best to date."
2015-11-29,5.0,"Boulder, CO",Trophy Brewing Company,They make you think the beer you are buying will come in a pint glass but then they serve it in a tulip glass. For a brewery you would expect decent and honest pricing. The pizza was okay. My friends said it was phenomenal but they like to argue with me.
2015-11-29,4.0,"Landis, NC",Big Ed’s City Market Restaurant,"A breakfast at Big Ed's is an enjoyable experience in multiple facets.Of course, first and foremost is the food. Excellent food quality and quanity at breakfast. I can only speak for breakfast as this is the only meal I have eaten at Big Ed's. Make sure to get a pimento cheese biscuit. They're great! Certainly worth going out of the way for to enjoy.But if you're a political junkie and enjoy watching North Carolina politics, Breakfast at Big Ed's is THE place to be. If you know the players, just sit back and enjoy eating your breakfast (leisurely if able). Observe the comings and goings of those in power in the legislature. Watch what lobbyists speak to whom. Note which members are there and what members are with him. It's like watching a game except you can't buy a program. Just gotta know the players.You'll enjoy a breakfast at Big Ed's. I know I do!"
2015-11-29,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sardi’s Den,The staff was great; the food was very tasty and the portions were huge. We will be back!
2015-11-29,3.0,"Chambersburg, PA",Coquette Brasserie,Went to Coquette today for a nice breakfast. I've been here once before and loved the food. Today I was served by a women named Kristin. She did such a great job. Loved her smile and her personality. She always checked up on my table and I never had to ask for anything. One of the best places to eat in Raleigh. I will deff recommend to anyone. I had the pancakes and they were very filling. My friend had the banana and Nutella crepes and she loved them.
2015-11-29,5.0,"Cary, NC",Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar - Seaboard,"Try the Pittsburgher here and exchange the Shoestring Fries for Onion Straws and you will love it! Spicy Garlic Ketchup comes with it and ask for Garlic Mayo. They have so many sauces here! Burgers and fries come with the Bad Daddy sauce which is amazing! Lunch can get so busy, so plan your visit!"
2015-11-29,5.0,"Cary, NC",Sitti,"Believe in the power of the Chicken Shwarma, Chicken Artichoke and the Chicken Kabobs! Savory and tangy, I love the Grilled Tomatoes and the Garlic Whip in the Chicken Shwarma! They definitely complement each other. The Okra Stew is also a must try! The Sfiha Pizzette with Lamb is a maybe. If you get it then ask for no cilantro. It will be so messy and get stuck in your teeth because they mince into small pieces! Say yes to the Pomegranate Spritzer if you are looking for a non-alcoholic beverage with quite a kick in the taste department! Their desserts can make your dreams come true! The Walnut and Pistachio Baklava and Ashta will keep you there until you finish and then want to order more!"
2015-11-29,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Station,"This place is honestly such a constant disappointment to me.  I was so excited for it to open 2 or so years ago because it was within walking distance for us.  We've been a handful of times. Each time we've waited enough time between visits for our last experience to have faded away, hoping that time would have improved both the food and the service.  But alas, our hopes have been met with recurring disappointment.  What we love about The Station is, of course, the outdoor bar and seating area.  The food, on the whole, is just so underwhelming.  The best thing I've had their was the Trio of Dips Sampler.  If you're willing to forgo having an actual meal, or just stopped in for drinks, that's a winner.   I've tried so many things, hopeful that I would find a few ""go-to's"" that I can count on.   The Cuban Sandwich is the second worst Cuban I've ever had.  The Roasted Vegetable Salad is just not good. I suppose it didn't help that, on that particular day, mine came out missing the cheese as well as the dressing. And far be it for me to have asked what may have been the surliest waitress ever to correct the absence of my dressing.  That really just barely touches the surface of how infinitely unpleasant she was.  To be fair, I don't think they set the bar high on service because it's always pretty sub par.  But this particular server clearly had an axe to grind and was choosing her tables on which to work out those issues. Sadly, we won't be back here unless we hear from our neighbors and friends that things have improved."
2015-11-29,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Buku,"Brunch. Best I've ever had. They have best in class traditional breakfast items like fantastic waffles and French toast, omelette bar, carving station, breads and muffins and they also have excellent other fair like fried chicken, assortments of salads, hummus and raita, and my favorite chipotle corn. I tasted most offerings and all were superb. Highly recommended."
2015-11-29,5.0,"Fremont, CA",The Morning Times,"Omelet had a lot of cheese and nothing else in it, and hot chocolate was too rich. It's nice you can sit outside though, but if you're wanting a good brunch I wouldn't choose here"
2015-11-29,5.0,"Glastonbury, CT",Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar - Seaboard,"Awesome! Great nachos, drinks & burgers. We basically had to roll out of the places because we were so full! Great prices too & good size outdoor seating area. 1 beer, 1 Bloody Mary, 1 daddy nacho & 2 burgers with tip -$50. You can't go wrong. That was for 3 of us since 2 shared one burger. I plan to come back when I'm in the area."
2015-11-29,3.0,"Winston-Salem, NC",The Morning Times,"So glad that we stopped by this place in Raleigh! It was around the corner from our hotel. Parking is a nightmare but well worth it. You order at the counter and while you wait you can check out the board for events going on downtown. The guys at the counter were really friendly and fast. There was a set of stairs to upstairs seating I think. We opted to sit outside since it was such a beautiful day. They have a couple of tables outside and it was nice to eat and people watch. Once you order they give you a number and they will bring you your food wherever you sit. The prices were very reasonable. $9 for a bacon, egg and cheese on a biscuit and a large iced hazelnut coffee. The biscuit was to die for. Pretty big and it just melts in your mouth when you bite into it. You can tell that it is made there. The bacon and eggs were ok. My friend had a latte that is served in a mug and they did the fancy leaf design in it with the foam. I would definitely go back when I'm in Raleigh again. I would love to check out the upstairs."
2015-11-29,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",PDQ,"Update 12/13/2015: Just went through the drive thru. The order taker was interrupted by a coworker and did not get our order correct. When I tried to tell the employee at the window, she ignored what I was saying and asked me to pull forward because it would take two minutes to cook the chicken nuggets I had ordered. I told her that I would not pull forward, because every time I have been asked to do so, my order has been wrong. Next the manager came to the window and asked me to pull forward. She said it would be a minute until the nuggets were ready. I told her no, that she could either refund my money or I would wait at the window, because every time I pull forward, my order has been wrong. The manager did not offer to refund my money, so I sat and waited for my order. My order was presented to me by the manager and as she was trying to dismiss me, I had to ask for my drinks. The manager then proceeded the try to hand me drinks with soda spilling down the outsides of the cups. I asked her to please wipe them off and she did. I have now figured out what is wrong with this store. If management doesn't care about the quality of the service, why should their employees care? I have received two emails from PDQ stating someone from this store would reach out to me regarding my concerns and NO ONE has. Again, this shows the lack of concern by the management. I love PDQ and was willing to work with this store, but I'm done. Nothing has improved despite fact that I was told previously that there was some retraining being done at this location. Good food, yes. Terrible customer service, yes. Thank you for the good food, I've enjoyed it, but I won't l be back. I know one person won't hurt your bottom line. It's just a shame that management cares so little and NO ONE ever contacted me.Update 11/29/2015: Just went through the drive thru. Ordered ranch with our meal, order taker repeated ""honey mustard"" and I had to correct her. Order taker said 2 orders of fries - we ordered one order of fries and cole slaw and I had to correct her. When we received our order at the window and checked it, it was correct. Too bad the employee who gave it to us was not polite. I was asked for my email number after posting my initial review, but no one has contacted me. No worries. We will continue to patronize PDQ because we like the food, but will continue to check our order before leaving. We will also not expect friendly service. Sad, because they were so good when they first opened.Original review: We tried PDQ for the first time when this location opened. It was great. Great food and friendly efficient service. We eat at PDQa few times a week because it is so close to our house. As of late the quality of service has decreased. The employees are not friendly. We get home and are missing items we ordered, dipping sauce, or our order is just plain wrong. When PDQ first opened, the people at the window where you picked up your food would repeat what you ordered when presenting it to you. Now they don't; which may be why we are missing items or our order is wrong. The employees aren't as friendly as they used to be either. We love their food, the new nuggets, the ranch and honey BBQ sauce, and the  special Angus Barn chicken sandwich (delicious beyond words), but are tired of the bad service. It has gotten to the point where we have to check out bag in the parking lot before going home so we don't have to go back. We shouldn't have to do this. Managers - take notice! You have a good product, but the quality of service is lacking and I don't understand how it's gone downhill so much since you opened. We will keep coming because we love the food. If it wasn't so good we'd say goodbye."
2015-11-29,5.0,"Apex, NC",Rye Bar & Southern Kitchen,"Went here last night with a large party... Contrary to earlier reviews, the food was great, service awesome and our food came out very quickly. I was concerned when I read the reviews but I was very happy with the entire experience. Convenient parking, nice atmosphere, great accommodations for a large group.. And all our food was great! My short rib mac and cheese w/ chard carrots and green beans was outstanding!I will be going back very soon!"
2015-11-29,5.0,"Cary, NC",Jose and Sons,Excellent blend of southern and Mexican.  There isn't much traditional about this and it was all soon good.  The house sangria was delicious.  Crank arm barbacoa ten stars.  My husband had the lamb and loved it but felt the side was a little salty.  I can't wait to go back.
2015-11-29,5.0,"Cary, NC",Buku,"Their menu changes a lot. I wasn't a fan of their Korean Beef or their inspired Vietnamese Noodle Salad. The server was great in letting me get something else when I found out the Noodle Salad was just noodles in a cold broth. The noodles were harder than I expected as well. The Filipino Halo-Halo is so worth it! Creamy, crunchy and yummy without being super sweet!"
2015-11-29,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Station,Loved the atmosphere/decor. Great beer selection but was not impressed with the food. Beer cheese and caramel onion sandwich and potato wedges were tasty but they failed considerably with the Cuban sandwich and burger. Would go back strictly for drinks and appetizers only.
2015-11-29,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gonza Tacos y Tequila,"Great food and great ambiance.  it is a bit pricey for the size of the tacos, but they are excellent.We started with the QUESO PICOSO with jalapeños: a great, spicy cheese dip.For the entrees we had:1. LACKO TACO (taco special): short rib tacos with roasted corn, pablano peppers, and cream cheese.  These were excellent, but the tacos are very small for them price.2. NACHOS GABACHOS: chicken tinga, pico de gallo, and cheese.  These I highly recommend.  Very tasty, and a bargain for the amount of food you get.  Go beyond the tacos, and give these a try.For desert we had the TALEGA DE PLANTANO: banana cream, with cinnamon & sugar in a fried purse with a side of ice cream and caramel sauce.  Delicious!"
2015-11-29,5.0,"Cary, NC",Beasley’s Chicken & Honey,I'm so in love with the Chicken Pot Pie! The crust is unconventional with the cornmeal crust (more like a big circular cracker) on top and not an actual pie. It is so delicious!
2015-11-29,4.0,"Conover, NC",Wicked Taco Raleigh,Food is ok but way overpriced. They BUILT this resturant.. so I really don't understand why it was so poorly designed. The food bar is in the way of ordering/checkout. Everything is walled off. The place makes me feel clostrophobic. Won't be returning.
2015-11-29,4.0,"Clayton, NC",Beasley’s Chicken & Honey,Best chicken and waffles you will ever have.  Also try the collards.   Didn't care for the restaurant atmosphere.  Industrial feel j don't care for and it is quite small.  With trying out if you are in the area for sure.
2015-11-29,3.0,"Orlando, FL",Nashers Sandwich House,"Found this while on a road trip and stopped in for lunch, it's fairly convenient to the highway if you travel via the beltway.  It looks like a chain but I'm not sure if it is, just seems that way inside.  Food was really good, very flavorful sandwich and soup.  Brewed iced tea.  Thanks to Yelp reviewers for sending us to another great Yelp find on our travels!"
2015-11-29,4.0,"Fuquay Varina, NC",The Pit,"While the food was pretty good, I can't say the same for our waitress. We saw her once, to take our order.  The rest is the time a waiter took care of us and checked in with us.  The food is well priced for portion sizes.  Great smokey flavor.  The hush puppies are one of the best I have had and their honey butter was delicious!"

(ok..if you can find it in a jar...I need a case. NOW!)Have the lasagne, the butternut lasagne, the meatball sub.Did I tell you about the meatball sub? where I fell in love, came back again and again..ignoring all of the other things in the case just so I could have an affair with that sub over and over again?Finally I came up for air (yes, pun intended) and tried the egg salad (awwwwsommmeee), and other items in the case.I have also had my way with pumpkin cheese cake, 10 hands wine, and the drop dead awesome all over your tongue pound cake with lemon sorbet.Whoo.again, i say....Whoo."
2015-11-30,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tacos Y Mariscos Vallarta,First time visiting this location with the Mr.  It is one of his favorite places so I decided to tag along.  I had always passed the location but never really thought about eating there.  The wait staff was friendly when we entered and we were seated immediately because it wasn't crowded at all.  Typically like any other Mexican restaurant it takes no time for the food to come out.  I ordered the chicken quesadilla but had to send them back because the cheese wasn't melted to my liking.The only reason I didn't give them 4 or 5 stars is because the waitress was not as attentive as I would have liked.  We had to get another waitress to get her to refill our drinks.  I would definitely go back because the food was good and I believe in giving second chances on customer service.
2015-11-30,5.0,"Charlotte, NC",The Oak,"Okay so perhaps the fact I was going with someone who works for the owner and knows the people at this place seeped into my judgement but it is what it is.Everyone was extremely friendly and attentive. My drink was crazy strong and my food was on point. I really wanted to try their breakfast burrito as one of my amigos said it was delish but I'm glad I went with the biscuits and sausage gravy. Thee best I've had in a looooong time! The Gouda grits were on point too. There were a good number of options to choose from so I'm going back with the hubs in a couple weeks when I go back to Raleigh. Yes... That's how good it is. I'm not looking for a new place, I'm going straight there for brunch on Sunday."
2015-11-30,5.0,"Maysville, NC",Pam’s Farm House,Absolutely horrible food. The worst coffee I've ever drank. The bacon was extremely salty and very very thin legs were undercooked. And the hashbrowns were mushy do not waste your money at this toilet.
2015-11-30,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",La Carreta Mexican Restaurant,"Like many of the other Yelpers here, I so badly want to see this place succeed. As a Wake Forest grad who frequented the Winston-Salem location often for margs and chips, I was excited to see that it would be occupying the old OC Bar and Grill space.The atmosphere is extremely casual, which is nice. The queso, the salsa, the pollo rancheros, the steak fajitas... All excellent. However, anything with seafood in it... So far, a no go. I hope that improves with time, along with the inconsistent service.I believe in you, La Carreta! I look forward to hopefully updating this review in a full months to include new praise and five stars."
2015-11-30,3.0,"Wilmington, NC",b.good,"The Toasted Almond and Ginger Kale and Grain Bowl is wonderful. Slightly spicy, filled with sauteed veggies and bok choy - I really liked it and I'm _not_ a fan of kale. I tried it with quinoa and was quite satisfied. The bowls are large, so it's a lot of food - vegetarian or no, you won't leave hungry.It's worth noting that there are burgers and other sandwiches as well. A clean, well-lit and well-located place."
2015-11-30,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Casa Carbone Ristorante Italiano,"I'm definitely a fan of Italian food due to all the free bread and carb-y pasta choices.  I've been to Casa Carbone once about a year ago and just remember it was really good so it seemed like a solid choice to satisfy an Italian craving.  We were greeted promptly at the door by several folks and seated almost immediately.  They have a nice selection of booths and tables and we were able to choose a booth.  The atmosphere reminds me of Peddler's right next door--very private and quiet.  The decor was likewise a little outdated (plastic/vinyl tablecloths, green-red patterned flower carpet and a drab wallpaper) but I have to say I was rather fond of it.  It made the place much more homey.  We ordered the beef braciole (thin slices of beef rolled with ground veal, herbs and spices, sauteed with wine, mushrooms, and marinara sauce), the Tortellini Alfredo, and a tossed garden salad (a bed of lettuce, slices of tomato, onion, and cucumber, with French dressing).  First the not-so-great: The salad. It was actually quite disappointing for a $4 bowl of salad.  It was some not-so-fresh lettuce bits with two slices of onion, two grape tomatoes, and one cucumber slice.  The most sorry looking salad I have ever seen.  The dressing is made in-house and was actually quite good, but super mayo-tasting.  Everything else:  The free bread was quite good and they gave us a large amount.  Our dinner entrees were also huge portions.  We ate probably about half of each.  The sauce in the braciole was actually a little bland (low salt) and very garlic-y.  It was actually refreshing to me to taste a sauce that wasn't overly salted so I enjoyed the taste.  The braciole was a little bland as well, but dipped in the sauce, everything tasted fine.  I choose for my beef braciole to come with pasta instead of a side salad, and it was just as I imagined.  The tortellini was delicious!  I loved the cheese sauce!  I'm usually not a fan of cheese sauces as they tend to be overwhelming, but this was perfect.  It was lighter than I expected and the tortellinis were perfect little doughy pieces of deliciousness.  All-in-all, Casa Carbone is an excellent option for Italian.  Excellent service, great food, and a cozy environment make for a solid dinner option."
2015-11-30,5.0,"Cape Coral, FL",Casa San Carlo Italian Restaurant,Just stopped in for lunch. The food on the buffet was fantastic. The atmosphere is nice and cozy. Will have to return with my husband for dinner.
2015-11-30,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bahama Breeze,Went in for lunch on Saturday.  The restaurant wasn't busy at all.  Was able to get seated immediately and had on of my favorite waitresses.  I ordered a Chicken Ceasar Salad and the Mr. ordered Jerk Chicken Pasta. The Mr. stated the pasta was the best that he had had in a while and we frequent here a lot.  He said the sauce was cooked to perfection not too watery as it had been in the past. The salad was good the only complaint is that they don't go through the salad thoroughly so they are a lot of stems mixed in with the greens.  The chicken was cooked to perfection and had good seasoning.  Customer service was great and overall we were pleased.
2015-11-30,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sawasdee Thai Restaurant & Bar,"Super good place. I like their pad thai, their sushi and I just recently had their ramen bowls which were so good. I always go for lunch, which it's great for, but it's a little too pricey to enjoy their food on the regular."
2015-11-30,3.0,"Holly Springs, NC",Chubby’s Tacos,Oh my. Chubbs and I are new friends today! The catered lunch at work was cancelled and I did not bring lunch on this rainy Monday. What to do? McD? Ewww no. I pull out my phone and the trusty yelp app says there is a Chubby's 3 min away.  What? I've been meaning to try this restaurant and it did not disappoint. Cheap eats fast and fresh and most importantly filling and tasty! I got the baja shrimp and the grilled shrimp taco both on soft corn tortillas. What is there not to like? The fried shrimp was not greasy or over cooked. The grilled shrimp was nothing exciting but good quality and with the toppings made a fabulous seafood taco. I don't know what the creamy orange salsa was but it was fantastic. I'm glad I have extra so I can put it on everything when I get home. :) The pico is yummy -they even threw in a bag of chips which will go home since I'm full enough. Less than $10 for two filling shrimp tacos is enough for me to become a fan.  Btw -Mine was to go -I don't know if I would eat here as it is narrow and muchos crowded and the parking lot is terrible.
2015-11-30,1.0,"Clayton, NC",Kadhai The Indian Wok,Usually my go to Indian restaurant. We have not ordered in a long time and decided to place an order. I'm hoping it was an off night. The naan was not editable as it was hard and flaky one of the orders of butter chicken was dry and not seasoned well. The other two orders were fine. Again hoping it was a off night as the food here is usually very good.

The prices are a little higher than I expected,  but we were starving anyway and didn't pay much attention.  I'm thankful we didn't.  The stuffed avocado appetizer was awesome!  The shrimp tacos were delicious!  The steak quesadilla was mouth watering!  The music was great,  90s alternative rock.  I would definitely recommend this place and we will return!"

I couldn't find any basil on the pizza visually & certainly didn't taste any. The photos reminded me of some great pizzas I've had in Italy. I had high hopes, but it just didn't live up.

The salsa is excellent.  Also, everything on the lunch menu, besides 2 items, is $5.99. This is the second time I've eaten here,  and I've been very impressed. Quite authentic and great service. I think once word gets out about the fantastic food, the amazing prices, and quick service, this place will be packed and the  ""go to"" Mexican restaurant in North Raleigh. Buen provecho!"
2015-11-30,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Jose and Sons,"I absolutely LOVE Jose and Sons.  Such a great date night and brunch place! I have tried most of the dishes on the menu and have loved every single one.  Chef Oscar and staff do an amazing job preparing each dish, making them a delicious blend of Mexican and Southern.  The chicharron and waffles will change your life.  The pork belly is crispy, sweet, and salty and the soft boiled eggs make a great addition.  It is probably one of the best dishes I have ever eaten.  If you don't want to spend as much, get the mac and cheese with bacon it will fill you up and it tastes amazing.  The staff is awesome and attentive and the mojitos are some of the best in town.  Parking is easy in the depot and even though they don't take reservations, you can always put your name down and they will text you when a table is ready!  I love to stop by Tasty Beverage next door while waiting for a table."
2015-11-30,4.0,"Ridgefield Park, NJ",Joule Coffee,"Short and simple: this place definitely served my need for good coffee and a quick bite. Our server could've been a bit more enthusiastic and attentive towards the end when we had to get her attention to get us another order of coffee before the check, but besides that.. great decor, great coffee, and our food was excellent. We ordered the biscuit w/ sausage gravy and the grilled cheese sandwich w/ chips. Pictures coming soon. This place is a must go to for good quality food."

2015-12-01,5.0,"Cary, NC",Tazza Kitchen Cameron Village,"I'm on Yelp often, and this place has been bookmarked for a while. After finally getting around to eating here, I just gotta say... it's a shame I didn't come here sooner! Tazza Kitchen is fantastic. My boyfriend and I went here for dinner the other night, and the atmosphere, the food, and the service were all wonderful.We ordered and shared the following three items:1. Cast iron goat cheese appetizer 2. Kale and chilies salad (w/ chicken added) 3. Spicy sausage and black pepper honey pizza All three were off the charts.. so good.. why didn't I come here sooner.... goat cheese appetizer.... warm, delicious bread........ kale and chilies... spicy sausage..... pizza.. mhmSorry, so easy to get carried away with food as tasty as this. Anyways, from what we experienced, the quality of the food here is top-notch. Fresh and flavorful--you can taste the difference. I didn't feel like anything was overpriced either, especially for the quality and portion sizes. An appetizer and two entrees were able to fill us up pretty well, and let me tell you, we can eat. The atmosphere was nice and relaxed with the decor being a mix between modern and rustic, which again, I adored. Overall, I had a great time. No major no-nos in my book :) If you haven't ventured here yet, I urge you to do so! You won't be disappointed."
2015-12-01,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tijuana Flats,"Taco Tuesday is where it's at!! Two tacos (several fillings to choose from), chips & a fountain drink, plus free hot sauce bar for 5.49! Tonight I chose ground beef and carnitas for my two tacos. The portions were huge, toppings were fresh, chips were well-seasoned. The carnitas was slightly fatty, but had good flavor (I probably wouldn't order again, however). Ordered a side of guacamole that was delicious!!! Lots of lime, cilantro & onion--just the way I like it. Probably the most remarkable aspect of this place is the outstanding customer service. I was greeted by three different staff, including a manager, all of whom were friendly and helpful. The young lady who checked out my take-out order was especially sweet. As a server of nearly 10 years, this is something I always notice and appreciate!! The service alone will get me back in there."

Biscuits are ok.That having been said...The coffee is so watery it's ridiculous. Reminded me of that swill you make in a hotel room.  Couldn't even drink it.Ihop makes better omelets.  This was just awful. Hard eggs, vegetables were raw (they should be sauteed and relatively soft not crunchy).The sausage patties are like hockey pucks.  Hard and black.The toast comes dry???!!I really really wanted to love this place from the reviews.  Unfortunately not so much.  Maybe I'll come back for lunch..."

Inside is small and super cute. We arrived right when they first opened, so we didnt have to wait for a table. Since it was before noon (stupid Bible Belt laws), we weren't partaking in any bevies but I did look at the list and there were some amazing sounding drinks up there. Stuck to coffee and water. The coffee was fantastic. Felt like I was buzzing after 1 cup!I ordered the walffes and my husband got the Norwegian dish (smoked salmon, poached egg). The waffles were huge! 3 big pieces with berries on them. The Woodford Reserve syrup was a perfect addition. Halfway through, my husband and I swapped so we could try each others dishes. The egg was cooked perfectly and the salmon was super tasty. The dish came with grits, which were delish. Anything cooked in a baby skillet is always a good sign!This place has a strong brunch game!"

One time I went, and we all offered our cards or cash to pay, and the waitress left without taking mine. Okay, ignoring your customers, rude. The most recent time, the waitress kept getting confused by really simple orders like ""Bad Penny,"" brought all our checks without any of us asking for them (and brought me the wrong check). Maybe it's just me, but it really pisses me off when they bring the check before you ask. It's like they're telling us to leave. Yeah, I'll leave all right, and you'll get no tip!"

2015-12-01,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Standard Foods,"So as construction for Standard Foods went on for months, I'd occasionally do a drive-by and try to get a preview of their space but NO way! They had craft paper tightly sealed up in all their windows and all the jumping around didn't help. When they finally did open it was a bit of a special surprise because I didn't know what to expect. And it was all good for my first visit, doing lunch. On the afternoon I stopped in, Standard Foods was super-busy, drawing a downtown/city worker crowd. I grabbed a seat at the bar, nice marble top in front of me. Lunch ended up being the deviled eggs along with a pork shoulder sandwich. The deviled eggs are a must do, super fresh and topped with crab. The sandwich was less successful, a bit over grilled on the outside and a bit mushy on the inside. But as you can expect, the flavor was there.Standard Foods service was solid but it should be at the bar. I have a feeling that dinner might be a better choice, Chef Scott is a talented man so maybe I just picked a bit off for my visit. Just an excuse to get back for a dinner visit I guess! But they are off to a solid start so four stars with expectations of more from Standard Foods as they hit their stride in months to come..."
2015-12-01,5.0,"Durham, NC",Joule Coffee,"After a handful of visits to Joule, it has quickly become one of my favorite brunch spots. It's hard for me to admit this since I feel like Ashley Christensen has a quickly taken over Raleigh, but this spot is tried and true. Even with the hipster vibe, tiny tables and no free coffee refills (although I need to remember to STOP ordering their brew here, it's SO acidic!), I'm still a fan. And those are the worst things you'll find here. What's great about Joule is the usual window box seating (ladies, please don't sit here if you're wearing a skirt/dress), truly one of the best people watching seats in downtown and definitely the best seat in the house (the only competing spot is directly at the coffee bar in one of the {maybe} four high top chairs--note: I think this option is only available on the weekends. And while the service here is truly A-OK (it won't amaze you but you won't make best friends during brunch) the true shining gem is the food! The menu is small but full of flavor. The BLT and huevos rancheros are good, but not great; the money is in the hot cakes the eggs benedict. I would order both these dishes each and every time! The hot cakes change regularly and are stuffed with seasonal fruits (I love the apple and cinnamon), served with a huge glob of house made whipped cream and maple syrup. And the eggs benedict are delightful! The béarnaise sauce is creamy and tangy, love the lemon flavor and fresh herbs (dill and oregano) served on top. These two dishes truly made an impression, they left a memory of happiness, something that I will surely be back for!"

My fried chicken sandwich and fries were delicious and well worth the 12 bucks. Food came out within a reasonable amount of time and was piping hot. I like the interior design and ambiance - much better than a chain or hole in the wall you find in the area. Only complaint was the loud, random overhead music. A very intense country song, then coldplay. Didn't seem to go with the vibe of the place. Maybe only noticeable because I was the only person in there, but they don't need it at all."
2015-12-03,2.0,"Annapolis, MD",Casa Carbone Ristorante Italiano,"This is one of the best Italian restaurants at which I have eaten.  The linguine with White clam sauce is absolutely the best you will ever eat!  One of the signature dishes, chicken a la Maria, is so good we get it almost every time we eat there. I travel all over the country and this restaurant is consistently the best in quality, service, and the pricing is better than reasonable. Michael, the owner, is a wonderful person and runs a beautiful operation! If you are in Raleigh, don't miss this restaurant!"

2015-12-03,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Aladdin’s Eatery,"I wanted to give this place a three star but in comparison to a non franchise chain Mediterranean eatery such as Mona Pita, this place is not the greatest.  Although the hostess was friendly the server was slow to come to the table. The menu does have a great variety but limited in pairings such as salad with pitas. The pita bread that was initially brought out was like chewing gum. I asked for crispy pita and got pita chips instead. The platter I had was ok."
2015-12-03,3.0,"Willow Spring, NC",The Morning Times,"Not what it's all that is cracked up to be. Pun intended.Intended to stay; got a call & need to go. The guy taking my order seemed to get annoyed with it. We where really looking forward to it based on reviews & looking for something new. Gave me a belly ache, my husband too.Asked a question about tumblers one guy was willing to answer, the other guy that had mentioned gave some attitude.Not sure what I did to him. But his food was as good as his attitude. Bad.Place look cool and modern though but it still didn't help the food that felt like bricks in my stomach."

I love the fish and the steak in the chicken, the Pablano Pepper is amazing, but my favorite thing is the drinks. They have spicy mojitos and spicy margaritas that are absolutely amazing. The atmosphere is one of a kind. The owner knows everyone and comes by to say hi to every customer and make sure they're doing well. Cannot recommend Ganza highly enough."
2015-12-03,2.0,"Durham, NC",Wicked Taco Raleigh,Definitely delicious BUT the wait is crazy long don't do the drive through. Tacos are small. For $5 it should be bigger. If time and money aren't a concern then go for it.

2015-12-04,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Taste Small Plates | Wine Bar,"This place was our go-to place! Food was awesome, great chef, great staff, friendly bartender. But then the group owning Taste moved the chef to another restaurant, and for some reason much of the staff is new. Now, although the food may at times still be ok, it's not the same. Last time we tried to eat there the hostess was rude and said they were full, although most of the tables were open. We sit at the bar most of the time, and the bar was full, but we weren't even offered an opportunity to have a drink while we waited for a seat. We left and haven't been back. That's a real shame because this place was a great place. It's not the same anymore."

But every time I find myself in Raleighwood, I make sure that I have time to visit Remedy Diner. I love love love this place! I have to admit that I'm one of those people who, when they find something they love, get it over and over and over. I've eaten at Remedy around 5 times and each time I've gotten the Tempeh Tantrum (PETA award for best vegan sandwich) AND the vegan key lime pie. The sandwich is awesome and completely deserves the award. It's like a healthy BLT for vegans/vegetarians. And the key lime pie is mind-blowing....it comes with this coconut whipped cream and is so delicious. There are many other things on the menu I'd like to try and maybe next time I'll branch out (or maybe not!). Love the vibe and decor of this place and the service is great. Nice staff who work here. I wish Remedy would open a second location in Durham!"

They obviously do an amazing job selecting and training their staff. From the hostess that warmly greeted us to the very attentive and nice server (Chris). And then there's the food, which is just as amazing. To top off what was already a five-star experience, the owner, Jason, stopped by our table. He had a short but nice conversation with us and ended up sending over a couple complimentary desserts in honor of our special occasion. Our guests were flattered and again, the desserts were amazing. Thank you so much for a wonderful wonderful evening!"

2015-12-04,1.0,"Atlanta, GA",Death & Taxes,"I really wanted to like this place. I sat at the kitchen bar, which was cool to see the food being prepared. However, the menu is lacking. There are really only 3 entree-sized dishes, and when we asked the waitress what to order she didn't give us a solid roadmap as to how to navigate the menu. I wish she would have recommended what most people order or how to get a full meal if we didn't want a full fish with a head, a tiny chicken, or a very expensive steak. the crab salad was good, a little salty. The cheesy potatoes were actually amazing. But the three of us left the meal still feeling hungry, with the food not being amazing enough to warrant ordering more."

A couple of co-workers & I went for an early lunch (11:15) & ensured we got a table at this medium-sized spot.Our waitress was super sweet & patient, since it was mine & one other co-worker's first time here. I had already scooped out the menu, so I knew I wanted the chicken salad pita salad. Oh, the dessert case stares at you! So many good cakes & desserts to choose from. The waitress told me about the chocolate nightfall cake & I was sold.Our food didn't take long to arrive. And my salad looked so good! And it was! The chicken was cut in small cubes. I went with the balsamic vinaigrette dressing. It was way more salad than I could finish; however, I ate all but maybe 3/4. :)I couldn't pass up the cake though, so this huge slice comes out with the waitress! I ate half & brought the other half back to work.Reasonably priced, clean, tasty food & great customer service. I'll be back!"

I was actually taken there on a first date and the night we went they had live folk music which was incredible.

2015-12-04,3.0,"Apex, NC",David’s Dumpling & Noodle Bar,"The best part about my experience was discovering the newly opened coffee shop next door, Liquid State.  There's a separate review about that though. :) Dumplings.  Oh my.  I have a slight obsession with dumplings.  With working at NC State University and having an hour lunch break I have the opportunity to explore the surrounding area.  Location wise I like where David's Dumpling & Noodle Bar is.  Far enough down Hillsborough Street to actually be able to get parking (that you're going to pay for), more of a business crowd, and less of the younger college crowd.  I found the place via Yelp and was excited to try it out based on the other reviews.  Maybe I came on an ""off"" day?  I'm still kind of new to the Raleigh area and feel like the GOOD places to dine are being kept a secret from me.  Maybe my expectations were too high?  I mean...a dumpling & noodle bar...how could you not get excited?!  Decor is nice.  Not gaudy, nice with a dash of comfortable rustic.  The windows facing Hillsborough Street are awesome!  When I walked in I believe it was the family who owns the place that played Host and seated me.  My greeting was less than enthusiastic.  I was seated at a table for one and my server came over to greet me after about five minutes.  I was ready to order by that point and ordered the General Mao's chicken lunch meal.  That came with a tea, rice, and spring roll.  Not a bad deal for about $10! The food came out rather quickly, which was nice.  The food was HOT.  Like burn the bejesus out of your mouth hot.  So uncomfortably hot that you have to sit there and stare at it/blow on it for several minutes to even be able to eat it.  The tea was rubbish.  You need more rice.  The dish is very saucy.  The little spring roll was pretty standard.  There was no condiments offered...which may be different...if you have a server who EVER COMES BACK.  Really.  Mine didn't.  I spent 27 minutes from when she greeted me to when I left.  My tea was gross...and no one was there to replace it.  I ran out of rice...but didn't have the opportunity to ask for more.  I could have used some soy sauce...can't tell you if they even have any.  I was ready to pay and needed to leave, so I went up front to the cash register to tell them what I had ordered so they could pull my ticket off of the computer system.  I don't know if they didn't have the power to do that, didn't know how to operate the system, or what, but they actually had to go get my server and have her process my payment.  There was no apology and no concern showed over my experience.  I'm okay with mediocre food, I'm not okay with mediocre customer service...especially when there are A LOT of other options within a few blocks.  Pros:* Nice decor.Cons: * Mediocre food.* Non-existent customer service."
2015-12-04,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chuck’s,I relocated to Raleigh and on my initial visit my father and I tried this place out and we were not disappointed at all. Great service and great food. A slightly smaller craft selection but hey we were there for the burgers not just the brews. If you are coming to visit Raleigh this is definitely a place that you should stop by. I love the fact that its right across the street from my office!
2015-12-04,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Jose and Sons,"Ole to Jose! This is an awesome, cozy little watering hole with supremely smokey salsa, a solid variety of craft margaritas, and an upgraded Mexican menu complete with Crank Arm barbacoa, loaded enchiladas, crispy flautas and many more creative twists on traditional favorites. Although I've only been here for diner, I've heard Jose's brunch game is a force to be reckoned with. The fare is sophisticated, without being formal, making this the perfect place to -- you know -- be classy while you face-plant yourself into a basket of tortillas. The warm, dimly lit ambiance and polished wood interior make this a great choice for a mid-week date or dinner with co-workers."
2015-12-04,1.0,"Fuquay-Varina, NC",Wicked Taco Raleigh,"The place looked great inside. Very much like a Moe's but with more aluminum and less impressionist art. Wicked Taco was very clean and bright.My taco fillings were served in a puffy pita bread like flower tortilla. I ordered a cheese steak-like taco. It was delicious.I had questions about some of the ingredients. The cashier could not answer the most basic questions and acted like she couldn't be bothered to try and help. Just blank stares.They offer wifi but no one knew the password. There are no plugs in the place so consider that if you plan to stick around with your laptop.The quality and quantity of the food was not enough for the price. One taco, drink, and cheese for 11$.There was a nice spread of uncommon salsas and mole sauces. The pico had a very smokey taste.The lady who was cleaning the tables was very friendly and attentive."

Once you get beyond this incredible appetizer (which, honestly, could be a meal in and of itself), you're going to have to make some serious choices. Cowfish combines all the decadent flavors you love from your most indulgent Chinese takeout session, with all the savory, gourmet burger upgrades you'd expect from your favorite burger house, WITH the creativity of modern sushi rolls and stacks. It's a mash up of crazy flavors based on the even crazier idea of combining sushi with hamburgers and the result is a fun, funky, cool dining experience."

Your table is privately located in the kitchen where the chef and managers introduce themselves. Then you can follow your dinner with a tour of the place and check out the gift shop. It's perfectly decorated this time of year for Christmas. Highly recommended!"
2015-12-05,4.0,"Charlotte Bridge, NC",La Carreta Mexican Restaurant,"This is a family restaurant.   Not your typical fast food mexican.  Great quality here.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  I have had the La Carreta Nachos, which are amazing.  You get a huge portion of steak, shrimp, chicken, and beans on a bed of chips.Also the grande burrito and Arroz con Mariscos is also a great choice.  Their salsa is home made and their guacamole is perfect.  It doesn't taste like a bunch of things smashed together.  Service was also very good, but we went during a slower time."
2015-12-05,4.5,"Poughkeepsie, NY",Red Pepper Asian,"I've been to Red Pepper about 10 times and have never been disappointed with the quality of the food or the service. Both are top-rate. The menu is extensive and the staff is eager to help with choices. I've gotten the Chicken Curry Noodle Soup the last few times, which  is awesome, but everything I've tried (Thai and Chinese) has been very good to amazingly good. There's no corner-cutting on anything.Decor is very nice & the sanitation rating is 99.9. Big pluses in my book.The only negatives: the dishes can be overly spicy-hot if you're not used to it. Also, I don't care for the shopping center they are in. But that won't keep me away.The prices are excellent, especially for this kind of quality. I wish they would move to N. Raleigh. THAT would make it a weekly experience for me. Try it... you may find your new favorite Chinese/Thai/Malaysian."
2015-12-05,4.5,"Raleigh, NC",Despina’s Cafe,"I have stopped in twice. The coffee both times was HORRIBLE. The lady making the coffee clearly did not know what she was doing. On the first occasion I bought a scone which was great. I decided to give a second try, and another person did a horrible job on a latte. I won't go back as there are too many other places to get great baked goods."
2015-12-05,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Zoës Kitchen,"Zoe's is one of my go to favorites, especially as someone who has food allergies. I visit this particular location at least once a month if not more. It's my favorite place to go for dinner for a Canes game and I often call for takeout. They have a pretty extensive gluten free menu, they do catering, and they also have ""tubs"" you can buy of their salads. I've been a huge fan of their chicken salad from the first time I ever ate at a Zoe's. I also love the chicken kabobs and the quinoa salad. This particular location has a lot of seating inside and an outdoor seating area that is really nice. They also have this cool app where you can scan your receipt and Zoe will give you free ""goodies"" like a free side, a free drink, cake...the more you go there the better the goodies get. There is also a separate register for take out orders so you usually don't have to wait in line when it gets busy. Just inside the parking garage there are also a few short term parking spots you might be able to snag if you are just grabbing an order to go. Fair warning, it does get pretty busy during the weekday lunch hours."
2015-12-05,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Capital Club 16,"This place was pretty good. The best part of my meal were the fries. They were matchstick crisp which I love. I ordered the special which was the roasted duck hogie.  It was pretty good, but next time I will order something else. I was happy with the fries. I also tried the spatzel which was made I  house. It was very fresh and I wish that the menu would have allowed me to order a bowl of just the spatzel. I also had the hot cider whiskey. That was also pretty good, considering the cold night that we went.It was a very clean restaurant, but I cannot speak for the bathrooms, since I did not partake in using in the facilities.The wait staff was kind. This is good for small groups. It is a quiet place, not recommended to bring kids. This is not a bar, it's fairly classy."
2015-12-05,1.0,"Carrboro, NC",State of Beer,"Although not in the heart of DTR, State of Beer is one my new favorite spots to grab a beer downtown. I loved the little things about this place. The golden slats of wood above the constantly changing draft beers, the family of vinyls hanging out on the counter waiting to be played, and the chill vibe where you can actually have an audible conversation with the person next to you.Besides being a bottle shop, they do offer a great selection of draft beers and a couple wines. I thoroughly enjoyed the New Belgium sour beer. Sandwiches, salads, soups, and charcuterie-like options are also available. My friend got a sandwich, and it was huge! I think they use bread from the Yellow Dog Bakery. One of my favorite things about this place was that I saw the chef making some soup. It showed that this place cares about their craft. That soup being made is probably going to be delicious and for sure not from a can."
2015-12-05,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Poole’s Downtown Diner,"The mac and cheese is by far the best in Raleigh! So delicious! It has an amazing crust on top and is definitely filling enough to share between 3-4 people.  Although this restaurant is expensive, they do have some pretty amazing food choices.  Whenever I go there I am pleasantly surprised by how well done and creative each dish is.  A great place to take a group of friends!That being said... it can get quite loud and I've heard waiting for a table can get annoying!  I always have a hard time talking/hearing people across the table from me.  And although I have never had to wait for a table, they don't take reservations and it may be a bit of wait at dinner time on the weekend."
2015-12-05,2.0,"Cary, NC",18 Seaboard,"My wife and I had the pleasure of visiting 18 Seaboard during the Raleigh food tour. Since we were on the tour we got to meet the executive chef, Serge. We have been on a few food tours in other cities and the chefs are always nice, but it is rare to meet one who has the enthusiasm and desire to take time to talk with his diners as much as Serge.I was really impressed with the menu and his knowledge and passion for the food. We sampled the fried green tomatoes, which were delicious, as well as a leafy green called gold frill. It was interesting to hear how they are combining local ingredients with their flavors. We also tried the apple sangria, which I would highly recommend.There are a few private spaces in this restaurant where you could hold a special event, and it seems the spacious bar would be a great place to hang out if you don't have a reservation.Given this place is tucked a bit back in a somewhat nondescript plaza, you might miss it, but that would be a mistake. Needless to say my wife and I will absolutely be returning here soon for a dinner reservation."

2015-12-05,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",David’s Dumpling & Noodle Bar,"3 stars for pretty bad mistake during service. -The Good! The decor is pretty, it's rather simple but elegant, with nice warm tones throughout and a huge bar in the front center. Hostess was quick and polite, we got seated immediately. It can be a bit loud inside, but not too bad so you can still talk. Water is brought out as soon as you're sat, and a little sampler of their ginger and carrot soup was brought when he came to take our drink and app. orders; it's a nice touch, especially now that the weather is chilly. We ordered their edamame and mushroom (vegetarian) wontons to share, seafood noodle soup for me and one of the vegetarian/rice tofu dishes with a side salad for my SO. Our drinks were refilled through our meal and the waiter was attentive and friendly without being overbearing. The food was pretty amazing, A+. The soup was great, with rich flavorful broth, fresh greens and a large portion of shrimp and scallops; best of all it was very reasonably priced. Why not 5*? There was a pretty bad fault with our apps: I'm pescetarian and my spouse is strictly vegetarian; I don't know if the waiter misheard us or what, but the runner that brought our apps out set down a plate of their half-fried pork dumplings. We've never been here before so we didn't know that their vegetarian dumplings look different (they're golden all the way around), and other than cutting into them, which makes eating a dumpling awkward, there is no way to tell what's IN a dumpling. So, he only noticed after biting into a chewing said pork dumpling. We're not big complainers and we both really dislike making a fuss; I can't recall us ever having sent food back, but serving meat to a vegetarian is a pretty BIG mistake. The runner apologized and took them back, but there wasn't really a good show of concern over it other than a couple ""sorry""s and ""He's been made aware of it"" (I assume the waiter?). No one offered any further apology or any other way to compensate for it other than taking them back and bringing out an order with the correct appetizer, which was fine with us, but might have not been for someone who has food allergies or other health risks.Overall though, we would come back. The *actual* vegetarian dumplings were delicious as was the rest of the food, we would just be extra-extra careful while eating here in the future."

I've tried the old fashion strawberry, creme brûlée, and vanilla sprinkles and none of them disappointed.  They have limited seating inside.  You can usually find me in the hallway standing at the counter juggling my warm fresh donut and my daughter. They have additional seating outside and that will come in handy when it warms up.  Service is friendly and speedy.  Ooh and their handmade sausage patty biscuits are quite scrumptious too!"

But not both.Enter the electrifyingly awesome twin towers of culinary power. JOULE does both and very wellYears ago, the first trip to Joule was when they first opened.I never thought they would be a breakfast place. Or a coffee place. I tried the coffee while sitting in the narrow little glassed vista point, feet slipping off stools scrambling like hamsters trying to perch and look cool while looking at others.Joule didn't let its light shine under a bushel. They grew up and in maturity offer REALLY good coffee to rival Morning Times and Brew.The baristas totally care about their product. They rock a latte like nobody else. Perfect temp, perfect milk. Just perfect. And I am a java hound ok? OK.But they have soared especially for Brunch on the weekends.I have always enjoyed the ever decadent Sunday Hangover. One bowl (""THE HANGOVER"" coarse ground grits with sharp cheddar, bacon, pico de gallo, scallions, and sour cream -- $12)...and you will not need to eat again until Tuesday Morning.My friends usually go for the Shrimp and Grits or the Benedict.Once, I had a meal that was sub par their standards, and the waitress was exceptionally accommodating in the resolution of the matter.Another time, was feeling sad and had a really tough week. Another waitress did a very sweet thing. She packed me away with the leftover jam from my biscuit. I love how they don't mind if you linger, no rushing you to fill your seat before you've put down your fork.Joule lights me up every time.."

A friend of the group had food cold served to him twice and not once did a manager approach the table. My friend approached the manager and expressed his frustrations and she was extremely rude and condescending. I believe her name was kaitlyn. She might want to reconsider the food service industry. On the bright side, the food was very tasty even though my green beans were cold."
2015-12-05,4.0,"Cary, NC",Driftwood Southern Kitchen,We walked into this restaurant at 9:30. We were told at the door that the closed at 10:00 prior to being seated. We immediately left so that they would not have to worry about not closing on time. I would consider this bad hospitality.
2015-12-05,5.0,"Elizabeth, NJ",Joule Coffee,"(This review is for 4.5 stars) We were in Raleigh for the holidays and a local suggested Joule to us. Boy I'm glad they did, this place is awesome! The decor is great and menu options were perfect! I had the biscuits with gravy and sausages and my boyfriend had the grilled cheese. The food was divine; my biscuits were so fresh!! The coffee was spectacular! We are coffee connoisseurs so we know good coffee when we get it! Prices were also fair, our only complaint is our server (blonde-haired girl). She was very dry and completely unimpressed. Someone who works here should be more approachable- someone give this lady an espresso shot or put her in the back away from the customers. She didn't come and check on us and we had to flag her down to order more coffee, fortunately I had my biscuits to distract me. I hate to give this restaurant less than 5 stars, but customer service is second to quality of products."
2015-12-05,5.0,"Wilson, NC",Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar - Seaboard,The food and the service was AWESOME!! Stephen was on top of is as soon as we sat down and we never ran out of tea! The burgers are the Best around!!! Do yourself a favor and try Bad Daddy's!! You won't be disappointed!!! Met the owner and he was super nice also. Will be back for sure!!!
2015-12-05,4.0,"Cary, NC",Jose and Sons,Delicious food. Great lunch menu! Loved the shrimp burrito. Guac and salsa is amazing. 10 times better than Jibarra. Customer service was great too
2015-12-05,1.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Rye Bar & Southern Kitchen,"This is the worst restaurant that I've been to in a long time. Our server wasn't the worst, even though she did forget to put in our appetizer and she didn't refill our water once. The manager, Caitlyn (spelling?), was the worst part of the night. It took us ten minutes for us to be seated, after we asked someone at the bar to be seated. My meal was delivered to me cold twice. No manager came over to ask how our meal was, which I found ridiculous after working in the food industry for six years. I walked to the host stand and requested the manager. When I spoke to the manager she was condescending and rude. I don't know if this was her first day on the job, but it was not very busy and she was extremely inadequate. I will not be returning."
2015-12-05,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gonza Tacos Y Tequila,"All I can say is ... WOW!  Beautiful and fun decor (Mexican wrestling masks on display), great friendly staff, and some pretty awesome Mexican food and drinks.  All around a really amazing place to go on a date or to go with a large group of your friends.  To eat we had the guacamole with chips, the Mexican flag, and a chicken burrito.  All were so tasty! The guacamole was super chunky with large avocado pieces and it was also really well seasoned.  I had to resist from licking the bowl clean cause ya know.. that's not socially acceptable in public.We also had a couple of NC beers from the bar and a ""top shelf margarita"".  Usually I pass on tequila drinks, but I really enjoyed this one!Another unique thing about this place is that they give you a fun bobble head while waiting for a table... plus they find you when your table is ready!"
2015-12-05,4.0,"Long Island City, Queens, NY",Joule Coffee,"You NEED to go here for brunch. I had grits with eggs over easy, my boyfriend had the short rib gravy with biscuits and we split a seasonal hot cake. Everything was beyond anything I had expected. The grits were cooked perfectly, it had the creamy element while still having the stone ground texture present. The short rib gravy was so flavorful, so perfect! The hotcake was out of this world. Crispy like a cookie on the outside, fluffy on the inside, with a heaping spoon of whipped cream on top. It even tasted good when it cooled off later. I'm telling you, don't miss this place when it comes to brunch."
2015-12-05,5.0,"Apex, NC",Joule Coffee,"It's an Ashley Christensen restaurant--what more is there to say? All your breakfast and lunch standards, to the nth degree of freshness and quality."
2015-12-05,1.0,"Fort Dix, NJ",Rye Bar & Southern Kitchen,My drinks and food were really good. I had the short ribs mac&cheese paired with green beans and mac&cheese for the sides. I love mac&cheese and was very pleased with the meal. The green beans were cooked wonderfully and the side mac was good too. My lemon drop martini was superb especially considering that it's too strong at least 80% of the time I order it from other places. Nice blend of strength and flavor. My husband had the turkey burger and he was pleased also.
2015-12-05,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kamado Grille,"This place is great. It has a very unique vibe, and I like it. It's a big building, so not too cramped. I tried the shrimp and grits, and they were fantastic. Nice big shrimp, and delicious cheddar cheese grits. I also tried the smoked Gouda mashed potatoes - don't leave without trying them. So good! My boyfriend had the KG burger, and he loved it. The iPad thing is a little weird, but we found it entertaining. I'm not sure why there is a server in addition to the iPad?m, but whatever. Half the time she was just doing the iPad thing for us. The only thing I didn't like was the dessert - we tried the chocolate cobbler. I never thought I'd say this, but it was too chocolatey. Just too much. I only had a few bites and I was done. Good atmosphere, good beer selection (although the beers are a little expensive). We'll definitely be back."

2015-12-05,4.0,"Memphis, TN",Mami Nora’s,"Must try place!  I agree with all the other reviews.  The food is great and the mom-and-pop hospitality is fantastic.  Their gyro is sooooo good... a little crispy on the outside but juicy in the middle!  Every thing else on point, right down to the warm pita and flavorful salad dressing."
2015-12-05,4.0,"Knightdale, NC",Angus Barn,"We've been here 5 times to show this place off to family and friends and always have an incredible time. When you come, ask for a tour after dinner. If he's here- have Ken as your waiter or tour guide. He knows his stuff!!!"
2015-12-05,5.0,"Defiance, MO",Chuy’s,I've eaten at a lot of Mexican restaurants before but this is by far the best I've had. The hand made chips are amazing with some really good salsa that has just the right amount of kick. The food has flavor that most Mexican places don't. The staff is friendly and the place is clean. This place is a MUST!!!
2015-12-06,4.5,"Spring Lake, NC",El Tapatio Mexican Restaurant,Fast service. Delicious salsa. Table service could be a bit more personable. Updated: We returned here for a second trip. The service was good overall and the food was delicious. There was a party there in the back but we were able to keep our drinks filled and the children happy. The only thing that I don't like is that the salsa is a bit too spicy for children and the don't offer anything milder or a complimentary ranch like some other restaurants. Overall decent experience just not the friendliest place to me though. They do get a lot of traffic from locals who obviously enjoy the food and drinks.
2015-12-06,3.5,"Fuquay Varina, NC",Shuckers Oyster Bar & Grill,"Update to the review I posted below. Shuckers took our experience and concerns very seriously! The general manager, owner and special events coordinator contacted us. They catered an office lunch for us to show us their apologies. We are open to trying them again. Didn't post 5 stars since we haven't had an event there yet but the lunch they brought was delicious! Bacon wrapped oyster and chicken dish were terrific! Original post ........We booked a special event for our office party. Took over an hour for salads to come out. We didn't get the dinners until an 1 hour and 48 minutes after our arrival. Plus the crab cakes entree was cold. They appear to be able to handle large parties and special events but the reality does not match the promise!"
2015-12-06,4.0,"Sanford, NC",Sono,"My husband chose Sono for my birthday dinner.  We are new to the area, but found it easily and parking was convenient.  Kevin, the manager, made a great first impression as he welcomed us to the restaurant and introduced us to our server.  Our server was very knowledgable and friendly, and asked the kitchen to try and replicate a drink I missed from Japan.  We asked about the omakase and he recommended it, as it turned out, the owner and head chef was there that night.  We had the most fresh and delicious sushi.  A week later and I'm craving more.  Chef Michael was very friendly.  Overall, it was the best meal we'd had since we moved here 6 months ago.  I saw some hot menu items, and they all looked great.  I can't wait to come back and I'd recommend Sono to anyone.I'm also looking forward to their new place that is going to be in the Google building, I think."
2015-12-06,3.5,"Raleigh, NC",Tasty 8’s,"Got the ""El Perro Dog"" and there's no chance I'll stop by here again. If you like a hot dog you could get from Harris teeter with some ""queso"" that reminds you of the awful machine made ""queso"" you could find in your middle school cafeteria then this is the place for you. The hipster vibe they attempt to pull off makes this place even more pathetic. Sh*tty hotdogs with a ""trendy"" vibe is like putting lipstick on a pig but they work pretty hard to accomplish that. I won't go back here again, not a chance."
2015-12-06,4.0,"Creedmoor, NC",Busy Bee Cafe,"The music is a blast back to GOOD music from the 80's and beyond. The beer options are more than you could drink in a week maybe a month. The duck empanadas are not to be missed! The flavors will explode in your mouth & make you seriously consider ordering a second plate. The horseradish mignonette makes the east coast oysters, it's tangy without being overly spicy"
2015-12-06,4.0,"Lyndhurst, VA",Soo Café,"Not the best Bulgogi since Korea, but good.  We always stop here on our way past Raleigh.  And, we admit that we are kinda biased towards our favorite restaurant in Burbank, CA.  And, the fried chicken is very good, better than the Colonel's, any day.  Don't forget to order your kimchi as a side.  It's free with the main dish, with free refills."
2015-12-06,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Person Street Pharmacy,"I love Person Street RX - both the pharmacy and the cafe. The pharmacy: always very quick to fill my prescription, and it's nice that a human always answers the phone instead of having to be directed thru a recording to speak with the pharmacist. Staff is super friendly as well.The cafe: I've had the portobello & hummus, LGBT, turkey and bacon, and bleu chicken salad and would recommend all of them. Favorite is the LGBT. Overall I recommend stopping by this little cafe to enjoy a sandwich or salad while you wait for your scripts."
2015-12-06,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",P.G. Werth’s,"The hubs and I have a Sunday ritual - he makes me coffee in bed so I can drag my lifeless corpse to brunch. We usually roll in looking pretty rough and if we can't get seats we try to sit at the bar. PG Werth's has been on my radar for some time now. Lauryn (Yelp CM) loves to brunch here so I figured it was probably delish. They were booked out with reservations but managed to squeeze a table for two out for us. They had 4 menus - drinks, coffee, brunch, and munch (small plates served all day). First, and entire menu dedicated to coffee?  Be still my heart. No seriously, be still. The caffeine was on point. Drinks were served fast and the turtle latte was  A+. Our server took the time to walk us through the menu and was attentive without being overbearing.  Lovely setting. Lots of folks hanging around exchanging gifts so it seems like a great place for a small group gathering. We ordered (chicken and waffles for me and the southern scramble for him). Both dishes were amazing. I had a side of siracha with the chicken. Yum. The waffle was sweet potato and the homemade syrup was sweet but also savory (cloves? Some other unknown spice?). I cleaned my plate. Like, really cleaned it. Like, mopping the plate with the last bit of waffle style. There's no shame in my food game. Husband loved his scramble. I know because he didn't offer to share a bite. I stole one anyway. It was great. We discovered there's a little corner store on the right side of the restaurant. Neat!  Don't forget to stop by the free little library across the street on your way out."
2015-12-06,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Raleigh Times Bar,"I ordered a 1915 Old Fashioned early on a Saturday night, and they were out. I tried ordering a regular Old Fashioned instead, and was given a super sugary Manhattan instead. The bartender did not understand his mistake. What?The only reason I came here was because I was joining a party that had decided to start the night here. Once again, I remembered why I never independently choose to come here. The cool/convenient space does not compensate for the bad drinks and poor service."
2015-12-06,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Plates Neighborhood Kitchen,"Delicious food but pretentious service. I made reservations at Plates for my birthday after hearing rave reviews from friends. They were right about the food - the cheese plate featured one of the best assortments I've had in awhile and included some delicious house smoked duck. My parents and I all enjoyed our entrees, which featured perfectly cooked meats and sides that were slightly surprising pairings but were thoughtfully and expertly chosen. Put your trust in the chef here and you won't go wrong.Unfortunately the service ruined what would have been an otherwise nice night. When I made the reservation I noted that my father is hard of hearing and asked that we be seated at a side table of possible. When we arrived on a wet blustery night, the restaurant only had 3 full tables, and the waitress seated us at the table right next to the cold door and in the center aisle by the hostess stand, the loudest table in the place. When I asked if we could have a different table, she made a big deal that she'd have to check with the hostess, who didn't seem at all bothered by the change. As she walked us to our new table she made a point of saying twice that they had lots of reservations but they were able to move us around, making it feel like a huge burden. She then ignored out table for 10 minutes without even taking a drink order. Then when I did order a glass of wine ( a delicious Pinot Gris on their list!) she condescendingly corrected my pronunciation of Pinot Gris, pronouncing it incorrectly like Grease. The rest of the night featured similar service. She came across as a novice trying to work in a 5 star restaurant which flies in the face of Plates' distinctly approachable and welcoming vibe. Oh, and all of those reservations she mentioned? They only had one other table come the entire time we were there and they were walk in.  Will be awhile before I go back and if I do, I'll be sure she's not my server!"

This is the first time we've had a Sunday lunch here, before going over to the Memorial Auditorium to see a musical for my daughter Julia birthday. The rooftop is the place to be although it is closed right now. They have great drinks here and a very good menu, I've always enjoyed the burgers and chips the most, but having bratwurst today."
2015-12-06,4.0,"Apex, NC",Mitch’s Tavern,"I first stumbled upon mitch's on a hot day after classes : they had a sign out front advertising limeade. I was surprised that the bar/pub was actually at the top of a steep flight of stairs! Made it feel like I had discovered something secret. The limeade was great. The food was better. I have been coming back ever since. Don't be put off by the humble store front: this place is a Raleigh landmark, and a damn fine restaurant to boot."
2015-12-06,3.0,"Cary, NC",Firebirds Wood Fired Grill,"This was another amazing experience with this restaurant. We made our reservation at 730, and was sat promptly as soon as we walked 8n the door. Our server was so nice, and gave amazing service. The food was so awesome. From the wine to t h e salad to the filet, and down to the cheesecake was perfection."
2015-12-06,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",First Watch,"I wanted to give these guys a better review this time around while our waitress was nice the food wasn't much better.  The omelette barely had any sausage in it, it did have a ton of onions.  The home fries were slightly undercooked and very firm.  The coffee tasted like it was from a truck stop.  My partner had oatmeal it was ok it needed more fruit.  I came here about 4 months early by my self and had the eggs Benedict and found the English muffins barely toasted and soggy very little sauce to be had.  The value eh there won't be a next time like in baseball 3 strikes your out."
2015-12-06,3.0,"Greensboro, NC",Waraji Japanese Restaurant,"I had high hopes for this place after reading all the good reviews and looking through the appetizing pictures. Unfortunately the food was not great. My partner found many pin bones in his sushi and we were informed by our server that the fish comes in frozen and they had no control over this. So not only is the food not fresh but they don't check the food before serving it to customers. My sushi was dry and tasteless. They could do much better for the cost of the sushi to be so high. I encourage you to find somewhere else to go because this place will be a waste of your money, and you will be left unsatisfied."
2015-12-06,3.0,"Oakland, CA",Second Empire Restaurant And Tavern,"We were a party of 9, celebrating our cousins' annual event, some of us from different parts of the country.  Our local cousins chose well in picking Second Empire.  The meal was exceptional, beginning, for me, with a ""Light Cosmopolitan"" (seasonal, so hurry if you want to try an delicious drink).  Most of us chose the pumpkin/crab tart for a starter, and there were no empty plates going back to the kitchen.  Our different entrees were all perfectly prepared, and those of us who chose the signature chocolate souffle, also sent back empty plates.  The serving staff, headed by Storm, was extremely efficient, delivering the plates at the same time, always available but never hovering.   Storm informed us that reviews are read in order to improve the service.  I wish I could give some pointers on how to improve it, but it was as near perfect as any dining experience I've had."
2015-12-06,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Clouds Brewing,"Today was my first visit to Clouds Brewing but certainly won't be my last. The variety of beers were a credit to some great microbreweries along the east coast and the staff was really helpful in finding the right beers for each of our tastes. Our server Ruth was a big help in guiding us through the menu which is a great cross between southern comfort food and yummy German noshes. We started with stuffed mushrooms and soft pretzels with beer cheese sauce, which was so good I could have eaten a bowl of it as my meal. My friends ordered the portobello sandwich and I opted for the German grilled cheese, which features a sweet smokiness from bratwurst and a surprising bite from just the right amount of sauerkraut. Despite a lot of screens featuring football games, the place was warm and cozy thanks to great lighting and Ruth's friendly enthusiasm. Perfect place for a Sunday afternoon bite!"
2015-12-06,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mi Cancun,Love it.  Had the best margaritas and dinner here tonight. Beef fajitas are terrific.
2015-12-06,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Coquette Brasserie,"Had lunch there last week and although I have always had a great meal here, it was just plain ""ok"". Plain being the key word. The omelet was (literally) flat and lacked any real flavor. The salad was a bit of spring mix without anything else added and I couldn't really taste any dressing. All in all, I could have fixed a much better version of each and saved the bucks."
2015-12-06,4.0,"Selden, NY",Clouds Brewing,"Service was excellent. Very accommodating. Food was great!! One small complaint. We sat in the back where the windows don't meet the wall. A bit chilly but the food made up for all of it. Would go again and again, just wouldn't sit in those seats. 4 1/2 stars."
2015-12-06,5.0,"Stuart, VA",Mi Cancun,"So your thinking '5 stars'?? Must be an employee or relative of one. Nope. I'm just a fan of Mexican food and when I find a good one...a really good one, it will get my applause and recommendation.  I've been there twice now.  1st time I had the 'Tinga' soft tacos which are made with shredded chicken marinated in chipotle seasoning and topped with pineapple. An excellent combination and full of flavor.  My second visit I had the 'California' burrito, made with a honey-wheat tortilla shell and again excellent flavor. The salsa is very good. Not too chunky and not a bowl of soupy salsa either. I would rate it a 'medium' on hotness. It's very good!  Even the chips are slightly salted and very crispy.  I'm a fan of a cold Coke (not Pepsi) and I was pleased to see them carrying Coke products.  Coke just has that 'bite' that goes well with Mexican food.  They have a full bar and also have 15-20 beers on tap as well as bottled drinks. The decor is fancier then the typical Mexican restaurant and I like it. TV's all over playing sports and news programming. Staff is very attentive and friendly.  Say hello to the owner, Jose and tell him I sent you. I told him on my first visit that I was very pleased and would tell others about the restaurant and I'm a man of my word. Mi Cancun deserves the praise, and anything I can do to help them succeed is a win/win because I look forward to becoming a regular."
2015-12-06,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",PDQ,"I ordered a chicken tenders meal and it exceeded my expectations. The tenders were perfectly breaded and served so nice and hot. Wow. I also ordered the chipotle and sriracha sauce and alternated dipping as they both were yummy. The fries were also delicious. Lastly I love the soda machine, endless choices. Friendly employees, delicious food in a clean restaurant, what more could you ask for? I'll be back again and again."
2015-12-06,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Buku,"Had reservations but still had to wait about 20 minutes to be sat. Defeats the point of a reservation, I think. Looking over their drink menu, I wish they had more craft beer options. I mean they have some, but it's heavier on the wine marked up 3 times retail price, and $10+ cocktails which aren't my thing. The two of us ordered two small plates to share, and then each had an entree, although the small plates are portioned and priced so that you could make a meal out of sharing 3 or 4 and not getting an entree. We had the pork dumplings which were quite savory. We also had the aloo chana chaat, which is a potato cake topped with chickpeas,  various vegetables, and a mint chutney. The potato cake had a very tasty and interesting combination of Indian spices, and the mint chutney gave the whole dish a refreshing quality, perfectly balancing the spicy sauce that we put on our pork dumplings. My entree was the Moroccan Tajine style chicken. Wonderfully seasoned and prepared on a bed of cous cous, apricots, and dates. Tasty, and surprisingly you got a lot of food. I was afraid this would be a place where you pay a lot and leave hungry, but the portions were quite generous. The dish the chicken was served in had very steep sides, more like a bowl, so it made cutting the chicken very arduous. My girlfriend had the pho, which neither of us really liked. It had a weird taste, like chai, which is fine but I'm not expecting it in a dish with steak and meatballs. Maybe we just don't like pho, honestly it was both of our first times having it. Overall, a nice dinner experience. Some tasty food, but a few things to keep in mind for next time."
2015-12-06,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Beasley’s Chicken & Honey,"Since I consider myself ""new to the area"", I enjoy finding cool spots to eat. I loved the fact that we were able to park for free(in a parking deck), so that was an immediate plus. Once we arrived, I figured we'd have to wait at least 30 minutes. There were a lot of people standing outside. To my surprise, the hostess told us that there were 2 seats becoming available at the bar....so we didn't pass that up. Once we sat down, it was a little tough to decide what to eat. We both opted for chicken and waffles. We also ordered green cabbage coleslaw and macaroni and cheese. WOW!! All of it was great! I would definitely go back. Not to mention we had a great bartender. I dig the vibe of the place andddd the food was great. What more can you ask for?"
2015-12-06,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Nashers Sandwich House,Great sandwiches. Really liked the Italian toast pork and my wife was in love with the fried chicken with jalapeño slaw. Fries were awesome too.

2015-12-07,4.0,"New York, NY",Capital Club 16,Creative menu. I came for brunch and had the challah bread french toast. The bourbon syrup is really delicious. Wish there was a bit more of it! This doesn't need to be served with the grit cake because it's pretty filling and great on its own.
2015-12-07,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Ole Time Barbecue,If I could give a lower rating I would have. This place is by far the worst bbq place ever. They served us microwaved ribs and nasty Mac-n-cheese. The place in Morrisville way better. It's called Smokeys Shack and always fresh
2015-12-07,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Lynnwood Grill & Brewing Concern,"this place was very rude and had very bad customer service.  I went in there for the monday night football game between the cowboys vs. redskins, I was ignored by the hostess lady up front and Iater on I  was asked not to sit down at two tables by the bar even though no one was sitting at either table and there wasn't anyone waiting. I told them I was waiting on a friend and we planned on ordering food and drinks but that didn't matter to them they treated me like a low class citizen and said I couldn't set there and didn't bother to make accommodations anywhere else in the restaurant ,so I told them I would just give my business to the Carolina Ale House and left."
2015-12-07,4.0,"Urbana, IL",Ajisai Japanese Fusion,"This was my favorite place for sushi at one time. I guess I'll need to find a new place now. The size of sashimi is noticeably smaller last time I went. I gave it another try today and it was a mistake. The rolls are cramped in small plastic containers, which makes the top of the rolls really messy. Also, I think they made the rolls to fit in the box... They were a lot smaller than when I ate in... I hope the owner would read this review..."
2015-12-07,4.0,"Greensboro, NC",Flying Burrito,"I was really hoping this restaurant would be better because of its convenient location to me. Unfortunately the food is bland and simple. Simple doesn't have to be bad but a taco with just beans and rice is just lazy (I was hoping for some added sauce or something else to be in there) They lack creativity and it shows greatly. I've been there three times because the service is good and fast, but I've given up on this place because the food is consistently bland and tasteless."
2015-12-07,4.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",David’s Dumpling & Noodle Bar,"Oh my god.  A whole place founded in Dumplings and Noodles.  You know it has to be amazing, and it IS!  It's a very classy affair inside, while still casual.  The service has always been great.But I can't underline enough how incredible the dumplings are!  There's a huge tapas-style small plates menu from which you can order an entire varied meal to try all the dumplings.  Although not dumplings, the soft-shell crab over seaweed salad is also Stellar, as are the spicy shrimp.  It actually is very dim-sum-esque.  These are not you hole-in-the-wall takeout Chinese dumplings, these are handcrafted varieties of steamed, fried, half-fried and whatever else you can think of.I can't comment on too many of the entrées, as I always get distracted by the noodles, but friends have said those are also truly delicious.  The food is always well-presented also.A word of warning: tapas-style dumpling orders can add up fast here, so perhaps consider one entrée to manage the bill.  But get down here!"
2015-12-07,5.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Waraji Japanese Restaurant,"Went with a group and maybe I ordered wrong, but I didn't find it to be anything special. I ordered the seaweed salad which was uber bland. For an entree I ordered the Mary and Spiral rolls. The Mary Roll was the better of the two, but the ""spicy"" tuna on top was bland too. The Spiral Roll had a crab stick that tasted like fake fake food - I know it's imitation crab, but it was like it came right out of a plastic mold. I didn't even finish it bc it was so gross. On the plus side, we had 14 people and the service was great. They huddled and were very attentive. The food presentation was also good looking - too bad it didn't taste as good. My friends likes their entrees, so I'm going to assume I just totally ordered wrong. For $46, it was a pricy mistake. Not sure if I'll go back."
2015-12-07,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Another Broken Egg Cafe,Stopped in for brunch and the restaurant was empty. We were seated immediately. This was my second visit so I was excited.  We received free Beignets since it was a first time visit for the Mr.He order steak and eggs with a side of shrimp and grits and I ordered the omelet with potatoes.The food did take a few minutes to come up but when it did it was hot and made to order. The waitress was very attentive and kept her eye on us and stopped by frequently to make sure we didn't need anything. Overall the Mr. was impressed so we will definitely be going back soon!
2015-12-07,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Ajisai Japanese Fusion,"I tried Ajisai for the first time and I was definitely impressed with the quality of sushi. All of the fish was very fresh. Don't come here expecting BOGO rolls like you can at many sushi places in the area. You'll pay a little more than the BOGO places, which is fine with me because the quality is much better. I also liked that they had a lot of variety of fish in their sushi and they didn't limit themselves to the more Americanized sushi with just shrimp tempura, imitation crab, and spicy tuna.We ordered 4 different specialty rolls and a couple of eel sushi pieces a la carte, which was the perfect amount for 2 people. For our specialty rolls we ordered the Ajisai, Viking, Spicy Mama, and Nobu rolls. All of them were really good and beautifully presented, but my favorites were the Ajisai and Viking rolls. We also took advantage of the check-in offer using the Yelp app. You can choose between free edamame or Japan spring rolls. We went with the spring rolls, which were ok, but I probably would have preferred the edamame. They did forget to initially put the order in for the spring rolls and it came out after our sushi.Since it was a cold night, we also opted for some hot Japanese green tea which hit the spot while we waited on our food. They refilled it often so our tea never went cold.As for the atmosphere, we went on a Sunday night so it was a little quiet and the restaurant was about half full. The service wasn't exactly the quickest, but I think that is the case for most sushi restaurants in general. I definitely plan to visit Ajisai again when I am craving some sushi."
2015-12-07,2.0,"Cary, NC",Flying Burrito,I gave it another try.  Meh.  Service was slow and there were only about 5 tables in the place.  The food that has usually been good....not so much.  Watery salsa...if you can call it salsa.  And much of the food had no flavor.  Off kitchen night?  Whatever...I won't make the mistake of going back.
2015-12-07,4.0,"Cary, NC",Bella Monica,"Love to visit Bella Monica. A great place for a quiet date night or to visit with a group of friends to celebrate an occasion or just share good food and drinks. Food is always freshly made with nightly specials or seasonal offerings. We often sit at the bar, but sometimes sit outside weather permitting. Count on a wait on the weekends. We love to frequent locally owned, family run restaurants and this one does not disappoint. The pork entree is wonderful if you're not in the mood for something with gravy (red sauce) on it. The salads are also more than just lettuce and dressing tossed on a plate. You can't go wrong with either the side salad or the Cesar before your meal. Staff is always very friendly. We've actually shown up without reservations, been told there was no room and then someone very graciously squeezed us in anyway. Highly recommend."
2015-12-07,2.0,"Tracy, CA",Firebirds Wood Fired Grill,"Service was terrible.  My husband wanted to take me out to a nice dinner and heard they had good steaks.  I was not impressed with my $25.00 ribeye that was about 3/8"" thick and cooked almost the whole way through.  I was scared to tell the server because she was not very personable.  I did really enjoy the salad though.  The bread they serve is tasteless.  I may go back and probably sit in the bar and have a sandwich and maybe a dessert."

2015-12-07,5.0,"Wake Forest, NC",Clouds Brewing,"Excellent concept with self poor beer area. The device was excellent and and excellent environment the staff was fantastic and well trained. They had a great knowledge of the beers as well as a good quality selection which wasn't overwhelming but not was it small. The food was good, the exception being a BLT wrap which wasn't as good as the rest of the food. The appetizers where wonderful especially the stuffed mushrooms and pretzels which were excellent. Some beers were a bit overpriced for instance the rare beer Cold Mountain was at $8 a bottle which isn't at all reasonable considering its low price being sold for. Very good overall and I will visit again!"
2015-12-07,4.0,"New York, NY",Vinos Finos Tapas and Wine Bar,"One of my new favorite places. I've had the corn and cheese empanada, the goat-cheese stuffed peppers, the fingerling potatoes, a cheese plate and salad. All of the food was wonderful. Great wine selection as well. I will definitely be back!"

Decided to try some gourmet burgers and have a few drinks. The burgers were juicy and delicious, fries were hot, dipping sauce was amazing, and the drinks were great. Our server was very attentive even though they were busy. Great way to start my vacation  in NC! Would 100% come back!"
2015-12-07,5.0,"Cary, NC",Driftwood Southern Kitchen,The service was top. The food especially the fried oysters was all good. Most of the 9 of us had the lobster roll which was delicious and plenty of lobster meat. I hear they have a Sunday brunch which I can't wait to try.  Great restaurant.
2015-12-07,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gonza Tacos Y Tequila,"We was driving past the restaurant on Friday night and I remembered all the rave reviews I have read on yelp. I presumed it was not all about novelty and hype; I was wrong.I had the mexican flag so I can have a taste of different proteins and different sauces all in one dish. The most discernible flavor was the tortilla itself, which is a shame. The sauces were bland and the proteins were scarce and dry. I liked the beans but they were covered with the white (cheese?), overwhelmingly sweet, sauce.I also had a taste of the chicken tacos. They come in a rather small portion (which is fine) with a tiny bit of dried chicken, a pinch of finely diced tomato and a slice of baby avocado so thin you can see through it. Want some sauce to pretend not eating cardboard? No problem, they just feel the need to charge you 50 cents  for it, lol.The service at the bar was good but they tried far too hard (and partially succeeded) to sell us appetizers and desserts. The place itself is pretty and there is a nice buzz going on in the dining room."
2015-12-07,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Station,"So there's this amazing waiter, his name is Ryan. He is friendly, outgoing, technically proficient, and very accommodating. A super nice AND knowledgeable guy. To me, Ryan, and a  couple of great bartenders have been the saving grace of The Station. Initially I think they were using their amazing location, eclectic outdoor seating and fun menu to convince us to overlook the awful service, long wait times, and clear lack of any managerial/hosting presence.  It has changed so much for the better. While the menu could have a few more offerings and the individual dishes could be a bit more substantial, all in all, because of Ryan and the bartenders, and what now appears to be a very present and accommodating manager, the Station is one of my favorite go-to joints."
2015-12-07,5.0,"Wilmington, NC",Taverna Agora,"Had brunch here with a friend this weekend. So delightful. We both ordered the Spanakopita Benedict - phyllo cup with spinach, feta and poached eggs with hollandaise sauce. I was curious if it was a large enough portion to share, but even with the potatoes it wouldn't be very filling if you shared. The cups are very light and tasty so you'd probably want to keep it all to yourself ;) Loved the location, very nicely decorated and the staff was very friendly. I was told the first Friday has some live entertainment and their upper balcony has been winterized. We'll have to come back!"
2015-12-07,2.0,"Wake Forest, NC",Wicked Taco Raleigh,"Was charged for two different orders, two different amounts. After 45 minutes on the phone with them I am told it was corrected. However, if I ever eat there again it will be cash only."

2015-12-07,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Rise Biscuits & Donuts,"The staff behind the counter were friendly and I didn't have to wait in line too long.  The biscuits were not so great, especially at this price point.  My biscuit was overcooked with dry bacon and cold pimento cheese.  Jubala down the road has much better biscuits.  Our group ordered a dozen donuts and I sampled a few, the old fashioned with lemon icing was my favorite.  We all seemed to agree the donuts were better than the biscuits.  The coffee was good and so were the potato hash cakes that didn't come out almost burned.  More than half the people in my group had food (not donuts) overcooked or near burned, which is disappointing."
2015-12-08,4.0,"Southern Pines, NC",First Watch,"Always amazing customer service and food!! Love this place. I get the avocado hash and it's always fresh and perfectly cooked. Delicious coffee and juice. Highly suggest trying this out, if you haven't and making it a staple"

2015-12-08,4.0,"Holly Springs, NC",Salt & Lime Cabo Grill,"First off.. Our server was really good! She was attentive and very friendly! Now for the down side. The guacamole was great (but not the best I've had), it seemed to have the right balance with all its ingredients. The Cabo rolls were tasty for an appetizer, and the Chipotle Ranch dressing severed with them certainly complemented them well. My girlfriend and I ordered the island shrimp tacos and beef braised tacos. Well,  the island tacos were too sweet for my liking. They said the shrimp was supposed to have Jerk seasoning, yet they really lacked that bite I'm used to having with Jerk seasoning. The island tacos were lacking that savory flavor I was expecting, it just tasted like a fruity taco.The beef braised tacos were mediocre at best. They were a bit on the dry side for being braised. No real thrills and frills. The drinks had good flavor but lacked the main ingredient... ALCOHOL... Expensive, and extremely weak for the price! Probably won't be back since we live in Holly Springs, just not enough WOW factor in the product."

I lived in Belgium for two years and this place brings me back to the Brassseries in Brussels and Paris. There's some solid French fair on the menu and the charcuterie is top notch. I've had brunch and dinner in the dining room and I've enjoyed Charcuterie and booze at the zinc bar. All of these have been great experiences.I've been very happy with their wine and beer selection too. Overall, this place has great food and drink and a little taste of France."

No problem! They still had a nice selection of baked goods. I enjoyed a cappuccino with a PBJ scone, my boyfriend had a sprinkled sugar cookie. I preferred his cookie over my scone with was bland with only a hint of smoked peanut flavor. However I am looking forward to returning while their kitchen is open."
2015-12-08,4.0,"San Francisco, CA",Buku,Incredible! This is one of the places where everything sounds delicious and you change your mind several times while deciding what to order. Each of us ordered something different and everything was great. Awesome atmosphere as well.

2015-12-09,4.0,"Durham, NC",Lee’s Kitchen,"I went to Lees Kitchen on 12/9/15, and was extremely disappointed after I got my food and tasted it. But first, I would like to point out that one of the servers appears to not like her job. Her demeanor was not inviting, and made me feel as if I was putting her through trouble. Very poor customer service skills, if you are trying to get customers to come back. Secondly, either you are a Jamaican restaurant or you are a soul food restaurant. The two do not go together. I come from up north, and have eaten in some of the best restaurants that specialize in Caribbean food. The food is authentic and has a distinct taste. The food at Lees Kitchen taste like an African American trying to replicate what they think Caribbean food is supposed to taste like. If this is a Jamaican person cooking the food, then they need to go back to their mother's kitchen and learn the basics. This food is not traditional by a long shot, it's not even mediocre. I ordered ox tails. They had an excessive amount of fat on them, which is not a problem, because it should give it flavor, but in this case, they were tough. the mixed vegetables, consisted of a cabbage mixed with canned vegetables, and they put gravy on the rice and peas, which took away from the flavor. The crust on the beef patty was so thick, not firm and flaky, that I needed a lot of water to wash it down. For what I paid for the food and what I got, was highway robbery. If I could give you no stars, that's exactly what you would have gotten. If people consider Lees Kitchen to be good Caribbean food, then obviously they have not had Caribbean food anywhere else but here. Definitely will not come back, nor would I recommend this restaurant to anyone."
2015-12-09,5.0,"Erie, CO",Stanbury,"It doesn't get much better than this! Flying in on business gives me the opportunity to sit at the bar, watch the open kitchen, and engage with other patrons. The Bone Marrow had great char, was served with great accompaniments that cut the richness, and generously portioned. The pigs head was delish, although don't expect the flavor of the meat to be at all off-putting or gamey - it closely resembles a delicate finely shredded pulled pork. Other highlights I had the chance to sample from some trading with my fellow diners at the bar included the scallops, duck pastrami, and beef heart. Menu is mostly small plates - all look beautiful and have bright balanced flavors, plenty of acidity, sweetness, salty, yummy. Chef is in the kitchen on the line almost every night and engages with guests. Bar service was among the best in the city; friendly conversation when you wanted it to be, relationship building between bar guests, deep bar knowledge, and the occasional sample of something to explore a unique spirit or wine. Kudos to Chef Dru and his team. Kicking myself I can't remember the bartenders name...but ask for his fresh fruit syrups in a drink. I usually hate grapefruit, but I could have drank a bottle of his mixed with soda water. I would have had more, but I spilled it all over the bar and they couldn't have been cooler. Thanks for the great experience. As a plus, I found the pricepoint completely reasonable. Granted, I feel as though all of Raleigh is entirely reasonable compared to my hometown in Denver/Boulder."
2015-12-09,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",510 Tavern,"Love the location, but the ambiance is a little random. One part sports bar, one part dance club, one part lounge. The food is delicious, so opt for dinner rather than happy hour or your final destination. The wings here will knock your socks off and the drinks are stiff, so you won't be disappointed if you're coming to watch the game (even if your favorite team does lose) or get your pre-party on. The space is large, so it can feel a little empty, but this can be a pro or a con depending on the type of mood you're in. I'll be excited to see how this place evolves the longer it's open and as more people discover it."
2015-12-09,1.0,"Zebulon, NC",Gravy,"My wife and i were very excited to try this restaurant for our date night and based on the reviews/ratings, we had expectations of a great meal.  Sadly we both left confused on why this place is so highly rate.  We had the Kale caesar salad which I found boring but it's a salad so what should i expect.  Next up was the lasagna.  I seriously think they gave me lasagna from the frozen food aisle at Walmart. The best part of our meal was the coffee which is sad.  Service was like the food- meh."
2015-12-09,5.0,"Apex, NC",Big Ed’s City Market Restaurant,"Wish I could give 1/2 stars, would give 4 1/2!! Want your FILL for breakfast? Check out Big Ed's, on the weekends the line forms around the corner to get in. Large party, don't worry, they can seat you. The sausage gravy is a personal favorite. My family devours the scratch made biscuits as they hit the table, which is no problem, the server will just bring more upon request. A little butter, jelly & molasses makes them disappear QUICKLY. All the pork products are from the Nahunta pork facility down east so you know it's fresh. Casual dining, Good eats for all ages."
2015-12-09,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bolt Bistro,"My husband and I went there last night for a light supper after a Christmas party and did not enjoy our visit. Our server Justin was very friendly and attentive. However, the food was not at all up to par. We ordered the surf and turf special - scallops and short ribs. The scallops were cold so we sent the plate back. The owner came by and apologized, which was nice. However, instead of preparing fresh scallops, they simply reheated them. When you reheat scallops, they become rubbery. Nobody wants to eat rubbery scallops. The chef should know this. The short ribs and au gratin potatoes were way over-salted. To us, the decor seems dated,even though it was recently done. (Do we really need another red and black restaurant?) The furniture was oddly sized and too large for the space. The artwork was not appealing. I had high hopes for this restaurant. It definitely had large shoes to fill after Mint closed. But we were left underwhelmed."
2015-12-09,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kai Sushi and Sake Bar,"Great sushi for a reasonable price.We started with the STUFFED JALAPEÑO a tempura battered jalapeño filled with crab and spicy tuna; covered with a sweet chili sauce.  A top-notch appetizer with a perfect level of spicy and sweet for $3.For the main dishes, we ordered 6 rolls:1) HUNGRY - spicy tuna and cucumber roll fried.  I'm not a big fan of fried sushi, and this was definitely my least favorite.  But if you like it fried, this may be for you.2) SPIDER - soft shell crab, cucumber, avocado, and crab stick.3) DARK KNIGHT - spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, albacore, avocado and black rice.  My favorite, the black rice in combination with fried shrimp and fresh raw tuna and albacore... divine.4) SNIPER- salmon, spicy crab, jalapeño, spicy tuna, and avocado.  My second favorite of our list, loved the spice of this one.5) KAI SPECIAL - tuna, salmon, white fish, kani crab, cucumber, cilantro, and masago wrapped in pickled daikon. This was a great roll if you like lots of fresh raw fish in a roll with wonderful flavor.6) DARTH VADER - spicy tuna, spicy crab, avocado with black rice, topped ""O"" sauce and tobiko.  Loved the black rice, but this roll had lots of avocado which made the roll a bit mushy for me.I definitely recommend saving room for dessert.  We had the tempura battered fried bananas and ice cream... AWESOME!  Get it!"

2015-12-09,4.0,"Durham, NC",Bella Monica,"I'll start by saying that i'm not the hugest fan of Italian restaurants. I know, blasphemy. But my husband is incredibly obsessed with Italian food so, for his birthday, we ended up at Bella Monica. I have always heard great things about Bella Monica but didn't know what to expect. There is a substantial patio area with heaters for the wintertime, but we opted to sit inside. While the dining room is on the more intimate side, we felt secluded in our booth. The service was top notch. Our waitress even offered a sample of a drink when I had a hard time deciding between two different cocktails (also just called being an annoying diner). The menu was varied enough not to feel spartan but wasn't overwhelming a la Cheesecake Factory. We ordered a Neapolitan pizza and penne pasta which, while they sound quite basic, were both amazingly delicious. The portions were also generous. Even my Bellini was huge enough to last me through dinner. Quite a feat. If I had to pick an area of improvement, I would say that the pre-dinner bread could be a little better. It's a very picky thing to point out. While it wasn't bad bread by any means, it was a little bland and made me yearn for some herby oily focaccia. All things considered, Bella Monica is a lovely restaurant with impeccable service and delicious food. Also, it wont break the bank."
2015-12-09,4.0,"Morrisville, NC",Godavari Indian Restaurant,"Very average food at an expensive price. Average price for a weekday lunch buffet in the triangle area Indian restaurants is about $10 or less. This restaurant charges $12 per buffet, so I expected a larger spread with better quality. But I was disappointed in both of those aspects. They had arranged vegetarian dishes on one side and non-vegetarian on the other side. Instead, they could labeled them as POTATO side and CHICKEN side. They had so much of potato varieties (potato bajji, potato 65, aloo subzi, mix veg which also had potato in it etc..). The chicken briyani, a chicken gravy and the kabab were good though. Chicken Manchurian didn't even have a pinch of Manchurian flavor. It was just chicken 65 style. The desserts were also equally bad. kheer was so watery that I felt like drinking hot water with a pinch of sugar and milk."

2015-12-09,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Godavari Indian Restaurant,"We've been here a few times for the lunch buffet.  The food is consistently good, and they regularly offer different items each day on their extensive buffet.One of my biggest complaints about many of the Indian buffets around town is that they are either not consistent in their flavors and cooking, out the quality quickly degrades.Neither of these have occurred at Godavari, and I'm happy to have a new favourite Indian buffet."

2015-12-09,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Firebirds Wood Fired Grill,"great atmosphere, great food, and very friendly staff (for the most part). i've eaten at firebirds for years so it was extremely disappointing the horrible service i received last week from a server who didn't bother to even tell me his name. He rarely checked on my table, rarely filled up my drinks or asked if i needed anything, and several tables around me were seated after me and received their food first. When I finally received my steak and mashed potatoes it was clear it had been sitting for a while because it was cold. I couldn't even grab my servers attention to let him know and had to grab another server. He didn't even apologize or anything, just gave an attitude. I love firebirds and their food but that service was unacceptable and i will not be returning unless I speak to a manager about this."
2015-12-09,4.0,"Devon, PA",Big Ed’s City Market Restaurant,"Southern breakfast done the right way, with heaping amounts of food to make you feel like you just walked into your momma's kitchen. If you have an enormous appetite, try and eat their ginormous hotcakes plate, you might even walk away with a T-shirt in the process. It's large but get their early to beat the crowd and tip those friendly waitresses well as they keep that coffee flowing in your cups."
2015-12-09,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bella Monica,Great small Italian place with good variety on the menu while maintaining traditional Italian flavors.  Casual enough to fit any occasion but with nice low lighting if you need it to feel special.  Good service.  This can be your go-to Italian place if you live nearby.
2015-12-09,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Another Broken Egg Cafe,"First, I have to warn you ... this place gets PACKED on the weekends. If you aren't strolling in by 9:30, you should expect to wait. A while. Waiting for brunch - battling a hangover and counting down the seconds until you can order up a bloody Mary as a little hair of the dog - is part of the whole weekend warrior experience, so know what you're getting into beforehand. The food is solid with typical brunch fare, but service can be a little bit slow. The overall experience is very comfortable, offering an upgrade for the diner loving crew who doesn't want to eat in ... well ... a typical diner. This place is best when you can sit outside on a warm morning because the restaurant gets drafty in the cooler months with all the in and out traffic."
2015-12-09,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chopstix Gourmet and Sushi Bar,"I took a chance today ordering Chopstix as I am a loyal customer at a Chinese restaurant located in North Hills. The only reason why I tried Choptstix is because they said they delivered. After 5 minutes of negotiating to get a delivery (my order was 1.05 under the minimum delivery charge of $15.00) I anxiously awaited for my General Tso's order and was delighted to have the food within 20 minutes. The color and smell seemed about right until I stuck my fork into the FIRST piece of chicken and I found a long, 9 inch black hair that was entangled into the depths of my general Tso's chicken and sauce. I would have taken a photo but now the hair is on the floor and I do not want to replace the hair on the food which is now in the trash. THANKS!I am sorry to have ever tried this place and hope the can step it up. I was really hoping to have a go to delivery for my office but they blew it for me. Its kind of hard to forgive when this is my first time and I already have a good place down the street."
2015-12-09,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Centro,"Don't even think the words Tex Mex in here. Centro serves up true Mexican flavors in all the chile verde, queso blanco, and asade salsa you can eat. The colorful, eclectic ambiance and traditional menu deserve a place far South of the border from Raleigh. Staff is beyond friendly, helpful, and knowledgable in a way that makes you feel right at home, even if you find yourself among unfamiliar flavors. Don't miss the enchiladas. Each one is artfully rolled to offer up a bold variety of flavors with each bite that perfectly complement and compete with each other at the same time. Of course, factor in a jalapeño margarita and some chips and queso and you really can't go wrong."

2015-12-09,4.0,"Saint Louis, MO",Pho Far East,"Best pho I've eaten in the triangle, period. Started with the fresh Vietnamese spring rolls, which were a little soggy from wet produce. Next was the beef pho (for me) (loin) and chicken for my wife. First tasted each other's broth. Amazing: complexity of spices -- they obviously cook their broth a loooooong time. Lots of meat too. This is a place worth heading towards. If I lived closer is love a month to eat through the rest of their menu."
2015-12-09,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Godavari Indian Restaurant,"Tried you twice, never again. My family and I love Indian food and eat a lot of it in a lot of different locations.The timing here is absolutely terrible. If your cook can't time the food then he/she may want to consider a different career. Get rid of your freaking microwaves. We can hear you slamming the door and pressing the button. It's a sad sound followed by an even sadder moment when you realize your food is now coming towards you. Get rid of the weird, white jizz on your food and add some fresh chopped herbs in it instead, it usually makes a good difference. After my travels to Philly, CT and NY and having had fantastic Indian food, I can safely say no one in Raleigh is doing it well enough. I'm actually going to go to Godavari's Boston location next time I'm in town to check their claim as Boston's best. I'm not expecting to be impressed. If you bought a Campbell's soup and microwaved it at home and threw some jizzy white substance on top, you'd have a better meal."

The fries they serve here were also awesome and crunchy just they way we like them. The parking situation is rough here as even on a Sunday afternoon we needed to look about 2 blocks away before we found a spot. Staff was great and the price is definitely right, I cant wait to come back and try their sandwiches/calzones next time."

Gino's had good reviews and delivered to my location so I quickly checked out their menu online and placed an order. Delivery was faster than quoted and the driver was friendly. My calzone was very good. Lots of creamy ricotta and delicious Italian sausage. The hot wings were not terribly spicy, which I am a-OK with. They were tasty and cooked just right. My favorite part of the order was the cannoli; it was DELICIOUS! I can hardly wait to order again. (Looking forward to trying the lasagna pizza next time!)"

I park at the Harris Teeter lot and walk over but I think there is also a parking lot up from the restaurant.This place gets a star just for the atmosphere. It's got a bar but it's not loud. It's cool to see outside into Cameron Village. The room is set up nice. I would definitely take my folks here if they came to town.You won't find a dollar menu at this place even if it is across the street from McD's. Expect to spend $15-$20 per person on dinner plates.When I came for breakfast I got a basic plate with eggs, bacon, and their AMAZING cheese grits. Those cheese grits were the bomb. I'd go back just because of that. When I came for supper it was with a decent sized group (8) and the service was nice. I got shrimp and grits so I could enjoy the cheese grits again. The plate came with peppers and it was ok. It was kind of messy which hurt my love of the cheese grits.Overall, great place that is a nice change from the fast food I consume too much of since I am a college student."

We both ended up getting a tasty grilled chicken pasta dish ""Chicken Mykonos"" with feta, spinach and mushrooms.  I had the vegetarian version.  Our fun appetizer, flaming Saganaki was great to watch and eat. Atmosphere was relaxing with many couples and larger parties. Servers were very pleasant and knowledgeable.  Enjoy!"
2015-12-09,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",PDQ,"After hearing such great reviews I had to check this spot out for myself.  It's about a 15 minute commute from my home which isn't too bad depending on the time of day you go.  I went out to this location about 9:00 so it wasn't busy but there was a decent amount of patrons in and out for that time of night.  We were greeted by a polite young man who helped us with ordering since it was our first time there even though I had seeked the advice of my friends.  I ordered the chicken caesar salad with the crispy chicken and  a side order of nuggets (don't judge me...lol).  The sauces are to die for, the caesar was so creamy and didn't have a twangy taste(bitter like).  I really liked the buffalo bleu too it was a perfect combo with the honey on the nuggets. The Mr. ordered a crispy chicken sandwich with fries and a side of nuggets (we like nuggets...lol).  He was very impressed with the flavoring of the food as well which is a good thing because he likes to eat the same stuff over and over so branching out and trying new things is always good.The restaurant is very clean and organized and very comfortable for eating in. There is plenty of seating and it's spacious enough where we couldn't even hear other people talking.  Sometimes some restaurants are so small it can be very noisy."
2015-12-09,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Standard Foods,"Absolutely amazing.  From the warm friendly interior to the locally sourced menu.  Start to finish absolutely great and quite frankly, a bit refreshing for the uber trendy restaurant scene in Raleigh that is constantly being turned over.The apple soup?  Holy cow is it good.The caramel rum cake?  Perhaps one of the best desserts I've ever had and most certainly the finest rum cake I've ever tasted."

I do declare that truly is some mighty fine NC BBQ! The liquid spices on the table also meet my ""homemade secret sauce"" approval. The hushpuppies are good so that means fried anything is good.  Trust me.  Just for good measure I also tried the chicken and okra.  I'm still not wrong. It's worth a visit every year even if the parking situation wasn't entirely as smooth as my persnickety east coast ways would like; It was polite and the weather was good."

2015-12-10,4.0,"Huntersville, NC",Bella Monica,"Came here with a party of 10 to celebrate presenting my thesis. The service was top notch and they had a nice large table set up for us. The server was extremelyKnowledgable about the entire menu, wine and pairings. The bread was delicious and well sized for a starter. The herbs on it and accompanying olive oil was quite satisfying.We shared a few pizzas, and I did my best to try others dishes. The pizzas are fabulous and thin crust like I enjoy them, so there's not too much dough in the way of enjoying the flavors. If you get sausage on the pizza you can get it diced or cut long. The beet and goat cheese salad was great over arugula and I added salmon. The lasagna dish was true, authentic quality. The marinara had local flare to it and wasn't a bottled taste. The cheese had a crustiness on top that was so satisfying and the meat was cooked to perfection.They do it right here - homemade, Authentic food all the way! Also as a tip, they don't do any advertising and don't even have a restaurant sign, which is all the more impressive and respectable. I appreciate the word of mouth feel and obviously this restaurant is doing it right because it fills up!"
2015-12-10,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Winston’s Grille,"Food quality doesn't match the price.  I think the money goes toward creating an upscale atmosphere, instead of focusing on the food.Not very vegetarian friendly (sure, ""no meat"" on a $13 salad is an option, just not friendly).I've only been here for work functions with 10 or more people, and the service always remained impeccable.  The people who liked the food tended to comment a lot on how nice the restaurant is.  Everyone else was ambivalent about the food.  The last planned function here went from company-paid to paying for yourself.  Over half of us backed out.Good for dates, business lunches, and special occasions.  Not for the food, but for the atmosphere and service."
2015-12-10,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Ni Asian Kitchen,"I really wanted to like them.  Really.  I went 4 times hoping they'd get better with time.The first time was a service disaster, but the food was okay - hard to mess up Teriyaki dishes and it was passable.Next, I ran into problems with Pad Thai being under-sauced and bland.  I had to dump soy sauce on it, and that's not a great way to ""fix"" Pad Thai.Next, the Thai Basil Tofu had 2 leaves of basil in it - at first I thought they made the wrong dish.  Zero basil flavor.Last time, the Thai Dynamite Tofu was anything by dynamite - bland and lacked heat.  Had to ask for a side of hot sauce.Except for the Pad Thai, I was picking large quantities of half-cooked onions out of the dishes. I'm always suspicious when the main vegetable in a dish is onion - it's a cheap filler.Service is very friendly, the atmosphere is perfectly upscale-casual, and the location couldn't be better.  But with bland food that is prepared poorly, I can't see myself going back.  However, the times I went, it was packed with people and many to-go orders were picked up, so it must suit the folks who work and live in North Raleigh.Give it a try - you may like it!"

2015-12-10,2.0,"Morrisville, NC",Second Empire Restaurant And Tavern,"I came here for the first time with my girlfriend for our two year anniversary. I must say, it exceeded my expectations despite having high ones. Where to begin? We walked in and were immediately greeted and seated. I thought we were supposed to be upstairs? But we sat downstairs. That was fine with me, it sounded really loud up there and it was nice and quite downstairs. We were given a personalized menu for our celebration, signed by the chef which was a really nice touch. Our waitress was super nice, and perhaps the most personable waitress I've ever been served by. She knew the menu inside and out, and offered heartfelt suggestions when inquired. She and the kitchen staff were super accommodating about dietary restrictions, and allowed my girlfriend to substitute anything she wanted, or even create her own ideas. I must say, it's rare in higher-end places like this to allow that range of freedom. They were prepared for anything we could throw at them. We started with some fresh baked bread, which was excellent. I had a cauliflower cream soup, and my gf had a salad for our first courses. For mains, I ordered the rack of lamb, and she ordered the ribeye. All the food was absolutely incredible - cooked to perfection, flavorful and combined with the perfect sides. The presentation was well done as well. Now, usually at these high-end french inspired restaurants, they're very skimpy on the portions. Somewhat understandable given that they're using high-quality ingredients, but a little annoying given how much you're paying for a meal. Apparently, their chef is from out in the country and gives really nicely sized portions. Compared to Fearrington House, the portions were much larger, AND less expensive, while the quality was on par. I guess Fearrington has to pay for that 5th AAA diamond somehow. Anyway, I don't know how I managed, but we both had dessert. The dessert was very good - the chocolate sorbet was unlike anything I'd ever had. The fruit gallette and blueberry ice cream were also good, though I would've preferred the fruit to be cut a little smaller. That's really nit picking to find something wrong with the dish. Will we be back? Absolutely. I used to suggest Angus Barn and Fearrington House to people who were looking for somewhere very upscale to eat, but this is my new favorite for sure. I'm already looking forward for my next visit!"

2015-12-10,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Second Empire Restaurant And Tavern,"My dinner in the Second Empire Tavern felt like a throwback to the occasional fancy family dinners of my childhood. It seemed to be, for the most part, a mature, wealthy crowd and atmosphere cozy and candle-lit.The highlight of my dinner was the french onion soup and the potato and leek soup du jour that my husband enjoyed.  The bread that came with the meal was salty and sweet with delicious butter. The rest of our meal was alright..we chose the scallop dish and the short rib dish.  They were both presented well, but didn't have the amazing flavors we had expected at this price point and for a special occassion dinner. The service was excellent and I felt badly for the busboy who must have been instructed to refill my water glass after (what seemed like) every 3 sips. The stuff was large and did their jobs very well.Unfortunately, Second Empire won't be at the top of my restaurant list for the next milestone. While I haven't moved it to the bottom, this experience didn't meet expectations."
2015-12-10,5.0,"Buffalo, NY",Oak City Meatball Shoppe,This place is amazing!! I am not normally one to leave reviews unless I absolutely love or hate a place.  Mashed potatoes and Mac and cheese are to die for. I recommend getting the sliders so you can mix and match the meatballs and their sauces. I had their special which was amazing as well as the chicken w pesto sauce and the spicy pork w the creamy sauce. My man had the hoagie and basically ate beyond his capacity! He is not one to over eat ever and could not get enough. He had beef meatballs w meat sauce with a fried egg and substituted salad for mashed potatoes(which were huge!!!). He ate all the plus the Mac and cheese I couldn't finish and was intrigued by desert cause this place is so awesome. We probably could have gone with out the Mac and cheese as an extra side as his salad substitute was a family sized portion.Prices are very reasonable as well. 1 beer 1 cocktail plus meal above with over the top portions for about $40 before tip.Service was great too. We will be back ;)

2015-12-10,1.0,"Apex, NC",Gonza Tacos Y Tequila,"Had dinner tonight with a couple of girlfriends. We had been wanting to check out the new location. I'm a big fan of their North Raleigh restaurant.  Wasn't exactly sure where to park, but figured it out.  I went with street parking, but apparently there is a deck nearby that the restaurant uses.  The reason this restaurant gets four stars instead of five stars for me is the hostess situation. When I arrived a little after six the restaurant was pretty empty.  I did have reservations. Originally they were going to Go Ahead and sit me at a table, even though my party was not there. But for some reason one of the hostesses changed her mind and decided to hand me a little miss piggy to hold and stand at the door and wait for my friends to arrive.  While if all the tables were full, I completely understand this policy, but since the restaurant was not even half full yet and I had reservations, I felt like they should have stuck to the original plan.  And then the little miss piggy, I'm not a petite gal, I really don't want to stand at the door of a restaurant holding a pig statue. Nor do I want to be called out Little Miss Piggy when it's time for my reservation. I don't really know if a lot of girls would like to stand and hold a pig statue.  But, hey maybe it's just me.  Then for some reason as I stood awkwardly by the door, they changed their minds yet again and did sit me at a table. I realize I could've waited at the bar, but I did not want to drink until my friends arrived since I was limiting myself to one drink (holiday season is getting out of hand!) so I didn't want to take a spot at the bar if I wasn't going to order a drink.  Friends arrived, ordered margaritas (strawberry was yummy).  I really liked the salsa.  It was thick and chunky and flavorful.  I had the Mexican flag entree.  Three enchiladas all with different meat and sauces.  Sauces are definitely on the heavy side.  But very yummy.  Friends had fajitas and the plantain dish.  Both were happy.  The plantain dish looked good and may try that next time."
2015-12-10,5.0,"Creedmoor, NC",Sardi’s Den,"Husband picked up take out for us last night in the way home. You can say its not 100% fair to evaluate a restaurants performance based on your first visit not even being inside the establishment, but for me a big tell as to whether you actually take pride in your work is your ability to translate what I say into food production. I didn't see it with my own eyes, but hubby says it looked like a pretty decent place. Quiet on the inside and some great outdoor seating.We ordered 2 burgers (me: bacon and cheddar and I added jalapeños, him: Sardi's classic--burger with cheese, and he chose swiss) and I ordered a bowl (their larger portion) of the soup of the day, potato chowder, for the following day's lunch.I was very specific to tell the guy taking my order: no lettuce or tomato on either of our burgers. I would take the pickle spear with mine, and my husband would not even need that. I used the words, ""just burger and swiss on one and just bacon, cheddar, and jalapeños on the other"". I ordered both with chips and requested a side of their ranch for dipping sauce.When my husband got home, I opened my burger and my first thought was whose is this? He didn't check it before he left, (maybe that's his fault?) but who screws up that much plain-ness? Mine was absolutely slathered in BBQ sauce. I went back to the menu--they don't even list a standard bacon, cheddar, BBQ burger. What the heck? There were also what appeared to be tiny carrot shavings all over the burger, an item that is not listed on ANY of their burgers. I assume carrots because they were orange and didn't melt with the cheese, who knows, honestly. The jalapeños were also not on my  burger, but in a cup on the side, which is something that typically would annoy me, (if I have to assemble my own food, I'll cook it myself!) but at least that prevented another medium for BBQ sauce to stick to. I wasted 5 paper towels soaking all of the sauce off my burger and still was only able to eat it once I drenched it in sriracha to hide the taste--I am really not a BBQ sauce fan u less it's smoked into ribs. Of course, both of us had tomato and onion (that wasn't even listed!!) on our burgers. I had no lettuce, but hubby did--so a teeny bit right? We also both had pickles.The next thing that struck me and what my husband was pretty peeved about was their burgers are machine cut, and so obviously frozen prior to serving. The menu specifically says hand-pattied. There's no way. They are creepily round like fast food sludge burgers.  That is terrible quality and unacceptable for a $10 burger. Let's be honest, I'm not very helpful in the flavor department as I was just trying to tolerate the BBQ soaked patty. I think I would have thrown it away, but I was starving, and going elsewhere/cooking just wasn't something I was up for. My husband on the other hand, got the full impact of their ""special seasonings"". They are so special they do not seem to exist! His exact words were ""it was alright"" followed by an annoyed look. That is code for: it was terrible, but I'm not wasting 10 bucks. Apparently, it had no flavor.Last, the potato soup. When I pulled it out of the bag I thought the bowl was a little small for a $4 serving of soup. Then, I realized the bowl was barely half full. All in all, they royally screwed up my burger, somewhat screwed up my husband's, the quality is awful, the taste is subpar, and the value is atrocious. We will NOT be returning."
2015-12-10,5.0,"Wake Forest, NC",MachuPicchu Peruvian Cuisine,"MachuPicchu Peruvian Cuisine is as good as it gets--consistently. We've been going to MP since it first opened and have never had anything less than super delicious food. It is our go-to restaurant. Try the ceviche--trios or tiradito--both will make you want to lick the bowls clean. The seafood dishes are amazing--fish cooked to perfection. Jalea for one can be shared by two if you have the trio ceviche and one or two of the amazing desserts. Service is warm, friendly and efficient. The owners/chefs Gloria and Victor make every patron feel like family. If you haven't eaten at MachuPicchu, you are missing the best food in the Triangle. Worth the drive to North Raleigh, trust me."
2015-12-10,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar,"I've been here a bunch of times. There is always a wait, and they don't take reservations. It's so good though!!! The sushi is awesome and so are the burgers. Often times in a restaurant like this with two disparate things offered together, one is significantly better than the other or they are both just okay. This is not the case at Cow Fish. I always get the crab Rangoon dip. It's awesome and not to be missed. The burgushi is creative and tasty. The basic rolls are great. My personal go-to is the Brento box, which has a double mini burger-of-the-week and half of a specialty roll, along with a bunch of sides. It's always great. This past time the specialty burger was a jalapeño popper inspired burger with jalapeños, jalapeño bacon, and jalapeño cream cheese. It managed to stay balanced and not too spicy. The roll I got was the blackened tuna. It seemed different than I remember but I could not confirm anything had changed since the last time we are here, so now I'm doubting a lot of things in my life. In any case, it's great. Go early at dinner time, get a bunch of different things, be full, and be happy."

This is the second time I came here and both times I have been incredible pleased. The noise level was the same, noisy but honestly that didn't really matter cause the food was so good. I got the chicken and biscuits and my cousin got the pot pie. We both shared and we had a salad. It was really good. The pickled green tomato on the biscuit added a really nice tang to the savoriness of the biscuit (which was everything you want in a biscuit).I seriously need to get the recipe of the pot pie. The crust of it was hard to break through but it added texture to the dish. It was more of a pot pie soup than anythingI left full and very pleased"

2015-12-11,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Imperial Garden Chinese Restaurant,"This restaurant is fun. It's got this kitschy feel of a 1970's Chinese restaurant with the added charm of a piano player.  The menu is the standard, Americanized Chinese food with items like a flaming pu pu platter for two ($9.95). There's no hidden, authentic menu here.  We are forever in search of Boston-style Chinese food, particularity chicken fingers.  None of the restaurants in Raleigh come close. But, we were surprised to find that the sweet and sour chicken here is actually Boston-style chicken fingers. It is served covered in that red sweet & sour sauce with chunks of pineapple and carrots.  Just order it with the sauce and veggies on the side and you will have those Boston-style chicken fingers with that distinct crispy-crunch that makes them so addictive.The crab Rangoon, hands down, was the best we have ever had. And even the duck sauce and mustard were well done. The duck sauce was really thick and full of flavor and the mustard had that sinus-clearing bite that I haven't found here. Again, maybe it is a Boston thing.Service was excellent and when we passed on dessert, we were served these complimentary, tiny squares of a coffee-chocolate cake. It was a perfect, two bites of sweetness you want after a savory meal.Imperial Garden is a fun place and we will definitely return."

2015-12-11,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Salt & Lime Cabo Grill,"I thought Salt and Lime was just another Americanized Tex-Mex restaurant like the many others around Raleigh, but after eating here, they are definitely in the upper echelon of Tex-Mex restaurants. There are so many unique dishes on the menu, and I really wanted to try them all. We started with some chips and salsa and ordered guacamole as well. The chips have a unique seasoning to them, not your typical salt seasoning. The salsa was mild and decent, nothing special. The guac was pretty fresh, very green, and just tasted liked you'd expect good guacamole to taste like.For lunch, I ordered the braised short rib tacos. For $14, you get three tacos, which may seem pricey, but the portion size is pretty big and they do not skimp on the meat. Each taco was loaded with a moist and tender fall apart short rib coated in a sensational BBQ sauce. The sauce was slightly sweet and strong in flavor. The meat was seasoned very well with some nice chipotle spices and was definitely the star of the dish. There was definitely some heat coming from the habenero pickled red onions. The tacos also had napa mix, guac, queso fresco, and cilantro. The warm corn tortilla was a nice addition as well. The braised short rib tacos were a hit for me, and I would highly recommend them.Overall, the food at Salt and Lime is very fresh and tastes really good. I think the price is worth it for the quality and portion size they give. With three loaded tacos and chips and salsa and guac, I left very full and very satisfied."

2015-12-11,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Rye Bar & Southern Kitchen,"This place is such a hidden gem! I live locally and I didn't know the Marriott had redone their restaurant about a year ago. What use to be a horrific excuse for an Italian restaurant is now a foodie's southern cuisine delight. I am pregnant so I couldn't partake in a cocktail but the bartender made me one of the most delicious mocktails  I have ever had, filled with muddled fresh fruit. We got a table in the restaurant and had a fabulous, very memorable dining experience. I don't know where to start the food or the staff! Every bite of the food was amazing. We got the fried oysters for an appetizer and they were perfection. My sister and I shared the chicken biscuit sandwich and macaroni and cheese with chicken. The sides alone are worth coming back for. Definitely pick the carrots as a side, you will be so happy that you did. The biscuit came with a salad that was just amazing. The Mac and cheese was so good and even better the next day as left overs. I love that so much of their food is local. The yummy and unusual bread and pickled veggies that comes with the table is from a bakery a few blocks away. I love that! Keep it local! I truly think the best thing about this though is the staff. They are SO friendly. The chef came out and is one hell of a nice guy. He was so great entertaining us and answering our questions. He obviously has passion and pride in what he does and it shows not only through the top quality food but through speaking with him. He is a native southerner and has cooked all over the south and that experience shows in his southern cooking. Raleigh is so lucky to have him! Our serve was also very nice. A manager, I'm guessing, also stopped by to ask us how everything was and she was so friendly and funny.This place truly is remarkable.

2015-12-11,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",PDQ,"Def a step above regular fast food.  Very clean, polite people and a company policy of community and freshness.  While I am impressed with their overall policies I found my grilled chicken to be inexplicable chewy/crunchy in the middle.  I believe this is a fluke and would advise going for sure and speaking with management if there is an issue with food quality.  Their customers are an utmost priority."

2015-12-11,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Standard Foods,"I had heard so much about Standard Foods and looked forward to trying it.  It was pretty good, had a unique selection of items, and the wait staff was excellent but I'm not in any big hurry to go back.  The menu is creative yet limited and most items are at least slightly overpriced.  One member of our party wanted tea to drink but was told they do not serve tea.  Do not serve tea??  Apparently if they can't get it locally, it's not offered.  Noble, I suppose.  I had lunch there and it was very vibrant - almost loud.  The tables are very close together so once you're seated it's a good idea to stay put until it's time to leave.  Overall, it's a 3 out of 5 in my book.  Not bad but nothing to write home about."
2015-12-11,5.0,"Kitty Hawk, NC",Chow Pizza Bar,"This was my first time coming here and have to say it will probably be my last. I met 3 other friends for lunch and let's just say you might as well plan 2 hours for lunch. It took almost 45 minutes for our food to arrive at the table. It was rather simple food, 3 burgers and an order of wings. Nothing complicated unless the fries were freshly peeled, blanched then breaded and deep fried was the issue?  The burgers weren't that big at all for the price of $9.50. I ordered the black and blue burger and let's just say it tasted like a salted burger with no flavor blue cheese on it. I guess they went to the fields to grab sweet potatoes because it took 10 minutes to get them after our food finally arrived. The food was ok nothing to write home about. Two raved about the burgers with egg and bacon on it and the wings looked pretty good. Just didn't blow my socks off based on the high prices for food. Trust me I don't mind paying extra for good food and great service, but didn't feel they delivered any of that. No apologies from the manager that dropped our dos or explanation for the LONG delay on our food coming."
2015-12-11,5.0,"Elkins Park, PA",Beasley’s Chicken & Honey,"I should have ordered the chicken pot pie.  And I have no idea when I'll be back in the area so I may go a long, long time without ever fulfilling that dream.Instead, I had the chicken and waffles, as I figured that had to be the way to go.  It did not disappoint, of course.  How could it?   But that pot pie...The décor is wonderful and I liked the laid-back atmosphere.   If this is a taste of what Raleigh has to offer, then I can see why so many friends of mine have settled down in Raleigh.   Amazing!"
2015-12-11,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kamado Grille,"Very good service (4 stars)-- although I cringe and don't expect much when a server says ""no problem"" for any reason. It's a clean, bright, and festive atmosphere, and looks like a great place to have a party. We were there at lunchtime so can't say anything about the bar service or quality. Be advised, you had better like smokey flavor!  We wanted to really like the food, but didn't care for the strong smoke. My husband's Reuben was full of very thick cut corned beef, with a lot of fat. The Terravita  entree and mushroom ragout was not to my taste (small roasted portobello cap topped with cold raw julienned vegetables including something I could only identify as broccoli stem parings!), but the server noticed that, offered a replacement,  and had the manager come over and reiterate her offer to provide another entree. As a result in about a minute I had a delicious greek salad.  I was impressed with the genuine interest in making us happy customers."
2015-12-11,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Salt & Lime Cabo Grill,Enjoying blood orange margarita!  Braised pork shoulder was tender and delicious. The sauce was a perfect combination.The new Habanero Mango Margarita is a must try. Very busy but immediately served.must try!

2015-12-12,4.0,"Mocksville, NC",Serena Sicilian Influenced Cucina,"Was in Raleigh for the weekend and my family and I were looking for an Italian restaurant we hadn't been to before, and after reading reviews we decided to try Serena Cucina. After making a reservation for 6:30 we showed up at 6:25 and we're told it would be just a couple minutes til our table would be ready. While waiting 3 groups of guests showed up and we're seated prior to us with a reservation. We ended up waiting 55 minutes to be seated.Once seated we had some questions for the waitress who seemed to have an attitude and never really answered our questions. We all placed our order and after another 45 minutes our food came and 2 of the orders were items we didn't order. The waitress grabbed the plates and once again another 20 minute wait to get the food. Out of the 5 of us only 2 liked there dinners. All in all it was an awful and expensive experience. You may want to think twice prior to going to this restaurant."
2015-12-12,4.0,"Radford, VA",Tarbouch,"I'm writing about my experience on yelps EAT24 having Tarbouch deliver to my house 13min away.  It was the second time I ordered and was a $120 order for several people scheduled for 7pm.   To make a long story short,  after a few calls there was still no delivery by 8:15 despite being told it was on its way.   Frustrated I called and cancelled the order planning to just to pack everyone up in the car and find - anything.  The driver shows up at 8:25, nearly and hour and a half late - after I just called to cancel.  I accepted the food.  I next received a call from the owner - at a wedding in NY - apologizing sincerely and insisting everything was free.  I offered to pay as I accepted the delivery, but he insisted - it must be free.   The food, as usual, was excellent.  This review isn't about the food. It is about the character of the owner who is committed to both the quality and service his customers receive.  He gets 5 stars because he cares enough to call from a wedding out of state when he hears something is wrong.  Bravo."
2015-12-12,4.5,"Raleigh, NC",Bloomsbury Bistro,"One of the best Raleigh has to offer.  Impeccable service and ambiance...relatively quiet and intimate, fresh linen tablecloths and napkins.  Freshly baked bread.  Caesar salads light, refreshing and expertly dressed.  Friendly and knowledgeable service.  Food preparation is a delight... top notch ingredients and not overly or crudely spiced, there is actually some subtlety in the flavors, a rarity in Raleigh.  Relatively small but excellent wine list."
2015-12-12,4.0,"Greensboro, NC",Big Ed’s North,"Great southern ambiance, huge portions, and great service.  Menu seems hit or miss to me.  Their bacon was delicious and eggs were good, but the hot cakes were bland.  I'll defintiely be going backs soon, but need to remember whats good and whats bland.  Great addition to the neighborhood.  A year ago, this area was a breakfast food desert."
2015-12-12,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Cafe Tiramisu,"The food was good, but I have never been treated so rudely! We met friends here for dinner, And after finishing dinner, dessert & coffee, one of the waitresses ( not our waiter) came over & informed us that the next party was ready to be seated. She stated that the hostess was too shy to come over & sent her instead.  We literally had just received & paid the bill.  Yes, we were chatting while we waited for our waiter to deliver the check to the table, but were not just hanging out after we paid.  Although the food was good, there are many restaurants where our patronage would be appreciated.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone because of the way we were treated. Also, we were told that the tables were double booked, ""which they do all the time"", maybe this is not such a great practice if you have to push people out the door!  Unbelievably bad customer service, ruined the entire experience & our evening!"
2015-12-12,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chubby’s Tacos,I cannot say enough about how awesome Chubby's is. Their Arbole salsa is hands down the best salsa I've ever had. Chips (endless bowl given with all meals!) are always fresh and not too salted. Their carnitas are always moist and delicious.
2015-12-12,3.0,"Morrisville, NC",Second Empire Restaurant And Tavern,"Frankly the worst ""fine dining"" meal we've had in Raleigh for 2015. Sure they're much better when not busy but from start to finish just a poor experience. Sat in the tavern in a cramped table which the server noted how awkwardly close tables were. Brought wrong cocktails twice. Rushed through dinner. Food average and brought a filet to be told they were out of NY strips. Sent the filet back and told they then had strips. Food clearly pre cooked and sat in warmers. Whatever- place will continue to make money on reputation but a shame the dinning room manager couldn't come over once to apologize but managed to fill our water 100 times. Angus Barn would have been better for $150.Oh one more thing- wife and I wanted to hang around and have a drink at the tavern bar. Appearantly the owner reserves his/her own spot at the bar every night (per the server) and takes a spot. While you have the right its your place, it's a douche bag move."
2015-12-12,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kadhai The Indian Wok,"This is singularly the worst Indian food I have had in a long time. I have been eating Indian cuisine for many many years and half way around the world. My wife ordered chicken tikka masala and I ordered chicken vindaloo, aloo paratha, starting off with veggie samosas. The samosas were very good, the aloo paratha very dry and tasteless. Now to the main dishes - both gag-me sweet. We complained and they remade them. They came out exactly the same, claiming there was absolutely no sugar or sweetener in the dishes. Blaming it on a sweet onion, the sauce base.  Absolute bollocks. It had a gob of sugar in it. So much so, it was totally inedible. They argued with us and then removed the entrees from our bill. However, they did add $1.99 for the extra papad and a half we asked for. Not surprisingly, at 7-7.30 on a Saturday night, we were the only people in there.Too many good choices around to go back there."
2015-12-12,5.0,"North Raleigh, NC",Cristo’s NY Style Pizza,The service was nice but the pizza crust is like cardboard. Horrible. I had the vegetarian pizza and husband had a meat pie. Asked for side of sauce and charged a fee and it was like water. If u like this pizza then u like Brixx which is equally awful ( more so). Side salad was good so 2 stars.

2015-12-12,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Rye Bar & Southern Kitchen,"It was alright.  The food was actually very tasty, I had the glazed salmon.  No complaints there, and the apple tart dessert was very good.  Service was good, but not fantastic.  It was very pricy, and I don't mind paying if the you can see where the money is going.  This meal, while good, certainly didn't merit the price.  The place is HUGE, and I'm sure you're paying for overhead.  In summary, no problem with the food itself, but not special enough to get me back."
2015-12-12,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Joule Coffee,"I very rarely leave bad reviews, but after repeated terrible service at Joule, I'm hesitantly to revisit. Popped in for a late breakfast with a friend on a Friday morning, and we figured it would be easy since they weren't very busy. Wrong. Our server wandered aimlessly around the restaurant and she never stopped by our table and asked us how we were doing. I had to summon her for a coffee refill. And when it was time for the check we saw her slowly cleaning silverware and I had to almost shout for her to come over. The previous rime I visited I saw several empty seats and the hostess refused to seat us. I strongly suggested she just split yo a four top so me and my friend can have a seat. Snooty staff and slow service. I may but coffee to go, but I'll be exploring other downtown venues for meals."
2015-12-12,5.0,"Port Orange, FL",The Fiction Kitchen,"Amazing vegetarian food! Went there last night for the first time- waited about 10 minutes for a table so we got a quick drink from the bar- delicious gin gimlets! Once we got to our table, our server was attentive and friendly. We had the lettuce wraps to start, which were delicious asian-inspires tofu wraps. Mmmm! Then we tried the chicken and waffles as well the pulled pork. Unbelievable flavors and textures from both dishes! The bbq was to die for! Smokey and tangy, perfect with the crispy potato cake and slaw it's served with. So incredibly impressed by this place- we will definitely be going back!"
2015-12-12,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mi Cancun,"Good. Mexican. Food. Had a fine food experience last nite. Carne Asada was well seasoned, fresh and flavorful. Service a little rushed, no love developed there, but efficient, correct service. The food makes up for any shortage there. The big frosty mug of Modelo draft was delicious! We'll be back."

2015-12-12,4.0,"Saint Louis, MO",Mi Cancun,"Very good place, some of the better ""mexican"" we've had in Raleigh ... Not all authentic Mexican (fajitas, e.g.) but very tasty menu. Went for lunch and were impressed with the chips and salsa as we pursued the menu. The salsa was not cheap and soupy and weak, like most places; this was mildly spicy with fresh tomato, onion and other good ingredients. We ordered a guacamole -- honestly one of the better guacs we have had in a restaurant. My wife ordered chicken soup for lunch -- a wonderful warming large bowl with plenty of shredded chicken, rice, avocado and other ingredients. Delicious. I had the carnitas tacos, which came with a tart tomatillo salsa, black beans and rice. Lots of meat in those tacos that was tender pork. We got out for under 20 bucks too. I would definitely be back .... Great service too!!"
2015-12-12,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Standard Foods,"Well, if it weren't for the very tasty sandwich, this would be bumped down a notch to a 3.The little shopping area is very specialized.  If you are looking for something specific that you need, unless it's by sheer fate, you aren't gonna find it.  There are some serious specialty items here.  Unusual (albeit cool), but nothing is standard. After perusing the food for sale, I wandered over to the restaurant.  It was shortly after the lunch crowd had cleared out, so there was a lot of space at the bar and many tables.  I opted to sit at the bar.  After cleaning, wiping down the bar, bullshitting with other customers, etc. the bartender finally walked over.  He was nice enough, but took his sweet time.  He got me some water and then it dawned on him that the hostess never gave me a menu.I ordered the trout tartine sandwich thingy.  And a beer,  Got my beer. 15 minutes later bartender comes back ""86 on the trout.""Okay.  Soooooo....can I order something else?I did.  I opted for the corned pork belly on sourdough with cabbage and egg yolk mustard (or something to that effect?)  It was delicious. So were the homemade chips.So the service was a little peculiar.  Prices were on the higher side.  But food was quite delicious.Not in a HUGE hurry to return here.  But i won't kick it out of bed."
2015-12-12,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Taverna Agora,"Greek themed in a super classy, rustic way. The intention of our trip was to have a drink on the upstairs patio, since it was an unseasonably warm December night. Great ambiance with trellis' lined with plants and lights. The first floor dining area is very spacious. We took the stairs to the deck, where there was additional seating and a bar. The bartender was helpful, letting us sample wines before committing. They also have wine on tap from a wine barrel... Pretty cool. Lots of cocktail options, variations on the Moscow mule with Greek twists. We had no intention in ordering food, but the menu looked so good that we did get an app. The hummus was pretty great. Just a tease though. The specials sounded amazing- either the sea bass or branzino option would have been my pick! They have fresh bread served with plated herbs, lemon, and oil. I think this is going to be the go to rooftop spot when the weather stays nice. My only thought was that they didn't have bar seating that wasn't indoors within the patio... Would love to look over Hillsborough street when having a drink. Otherwise, well done!"
2015-12-12,5.0,"Colorado Springs, CO",Jose and Sons,"Decent food. No TV at the bar hurts it for me. Food was good. Trendy place. Diablo burrito was good, spicy. If you don't like spicy, don't get this. I was burning up by the end... I just had water after drinking last night so not sure how the booze was. Menu is a little short but the quality was there."
2015-12-12,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sitti,"Not bad... We sat at the bar to wait, since we didn't have a reservation at the peak hours of a Friday night. The bartender was very attentive. Our table took more time than we would have liked, but it is a popular place. I was a little disappointed that the chicken skewer couldn't be made without the yogurt to avoid milk with an allergy, but I'll just call ahead the next time. They said its marinated prior to the dinner service. Pita and dip while waiting was really pretty helpful, since we came hungry. I almost fell twice on the floor and noticed another girl did fall... Maybe they should look into that. It happened last time, too."
2015-12-12,4.0,"Wake Forest, NC",Bonefish Grill,"I had lunch there on a Thursday afternoon. It was not very busy but the service was very slow. We were there for 45 minutes.

2015-12-12,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Rise Biscuits & Donuts,"Do you know I'm happy I am they opened a Rise in my neighborhood! Unfortunately, so is everyone else, so going on a weekend in next to impossible. So I popped in on a Monday morning when I was off and got a brisket biscuit and chocolate chocolate donut and of course, they didn't disappoint. On opening day,we bought a dozen donuts and had a donut hangover! Not bad! Favs: pumpkin, captain crunch, apple fritter, creme brulee., and the gingerbread. Next on my list to try: the strawberry shortbread. I do like the different design from the Durham location, looks more hip, and there is more space. Can't wait to see all the new creations!"
2015-12-12,4.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Sitti,"This restaurant has a really warm yet classy atmosphere. The waitress told us how to eat certain dishes that my unrefined self didn't know. Pita bread was in high supply. I liked the Christmas decorations (even though they didn't seem Lebanese). The specialty drinks all sounded good (I like that they call their spin on the Sazerac the 'SazArak'). I got a Vanilla Manhattan, which seemed uniquely spiced and was really good.There are so many food options--small plates, tasting plates, entrees, soups, specials, appetizers, and more. If you're scared of ethnic food, their chefs are just as talented at cooking regular American food. I got the crab cakes (not because I'm scared, just because I love crab cakes). My date got chicken kabobs and salad. Both were great. But the best thing was our steak tartare appetizer, which was uniquely flavored and very rich. All in all, it was a great meal and good atmosphere.Also, we arrived earlier than our reservation and still didn't have to wait on a Friday night, which was appreciated."

Slaw does not come with your bbq plate and counts as a side. All eastern NSC folk know slaw comes with bbq and real joints have corn sticks. Our food was cold tonight. Service was poor...when we could figure out which server was ours...and finally get them to stop. Our server was too busy looking around to even make eye contact. I eat bbq every week. And I'll continue to do so at a true eastern NC spot...where you pay for fresh food...served hot...by staff that have time for you...and pay a fair price. And valet...it would be quicker to park downtown and walk over. Yes, it's free...but some free things are not worth it."

2015-12-13,4.5,"Cary, NC",Taste Small Plates | Wine Bar,"It's a small building among a few commercial ones in a residential area. So yeah, when you feel like you're in the middle of a neighborhood to get there, it's correct. Nice quiet ambience, great place for a date with your significant other. We got 3 small plates. One was the salmon special, it was cooked perfectly. My favorite was the Deconstructed Tamale. A bit pricey for the quantity, with tip it was $40+. But the quality was top notch. I'd definitely recommend this place when you are in the mood for something a bit upscale."
2015-12-13,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",18 Seaboard,"First time here.... Service slow and overwhelmed. Owner came to table and offered no apologies. I am glad I didn't come here hungry, I would have been extremely annoyed at how long we sat here waiting to be acknowledged. This is my first time ever writing a review and have to admit this restaurant truly pushed me here. The menu is nothing special with a very limiting choice. The appetizer was a bit salty but that is always subject to taste. My salad was on point and the peppermint meringue was worth the mention. As far as my experience I would not come back. #poorservice #wheresmydrinks #belowexpectation"

The food was excellent in the biscuits were to die for. I will certainly make it a point to go back again and try something else."
2015-12-13,4.0,"Lansdale, PA",Pho Vietnam,"Pho Vietnam is hands down the best Vietnamese food in the triangle and comes at a great price too. Viet food in NC is definitely growing and luckily I think I've found my go-to spot. I've tried pho from many restaurants in the area, but this one has by far the best broth and perfectly cooked noodles and while it may not be my mom's cooking, it definitely deserves a seat at the table. When I try a Viet place for the first time, I always go for two things, that's pho and bun thit nuong cha gio which is a bowl of rice vermicelli, mixed vegetables, grilled pork and spring rolls. Pho Vietnam served great portions and nailed these dishes so I'll be back to try the rest of the menu."
2015-12-13,1.0,"Wilson, NC",18 Seaboard,"My wife and I ate here while we were doing some business in Raleigh and it was rated highly and was close by.  From the exterior it looked like a very nice experience.  The wait staff was very friendly, we were not dressed for high dining so we were seated in the bar which was fine, it was very nice.  The menu was our first concern, the concept of high brow cuisine and Southern cooking has never ended well for us, as our current home town of Wilson had a similar restaurant which has gone the way of the dinosaur.  I had the beef brisket which was one of two available beef dishes (the other being the beef tenderloin - filet).  They also had a pork tenderloin option, which did not seem very appetizing at the time as we typically do not eat pork.  My wife got the Mahi mahi with their own unique way of presentation.  My wife being from Ft. Lauderdale admitted she should have not ordered the fish in NC but saw no other desirable options.  While they did have a nice sauce at the bottom of the dish, the fish was very dry and over cooked.  I tasted it as well and did not care for the flavor of it myself, but she seemed to think it was decent, just very dry.  Her starch selection was some type of potato which she liked.  My brisket while it was not dry, it was extremely fatty (about half of the two slices were fat).  Yes I know where the brisket comes from and it is usually not the most desired cut of meat.  With that said, the fat did make the slow cooking process for the brisket very tender, which I give them kudos for.  The presentation was quite atypical, with it being sliced.  The bbq sauce was a traditional KC type (which was very much appreciated as I have not embraced NC vinegar/mustard based bbq yet - or probably ever - sorry).  My wife thought the brisket tasted good.   We got an Oregon based (4 Seasons?) Pinot that was decent, it would appear to me that it should have been a ten to twelve dollar bottle at the wine shop, so they have a triple mark on it, which I personally believe is a little extreme.  Overall, not very impressed with the menu or the final product.  I very much doubt we will repeat this experience."
2015-12-13,2.0,"Albany, NY",Bahama Breeze,"Oh man- first let me start by saying that their Coconut Mojito is EVERYTHING! I had the beef stuffed plantain and my fiance had the lobster mac and cheese. I enjoyed mine, his lobster was fried which wasn't displayed in the picture. We didn't expect that and he says his was a little overcooked. We also ordered the lobster and shrimp quesadilla which was ok. It could have been seasoned better. But overall it was good customer service and good food and we'd most certainly go back."

Everyone that works there seems super nice. Don't forget to donate to the fire department in the bin by the register!"

I am from California so my standards for Mexican are pretty high but this was almost inedible. I ordered a combo taco, burrito, and cheese enchilada. The food took forever to make and the place was empty. My beef taco was nasty. I thought about not eating it and almost set it down but I was starving. I also had a chicken burrito. I couldn't eat it, it was so gross. If you can't make a decent chicken burrito then there is no hope. The cheese enchilada's cheese was barely melt d and the sauce was bland and gross. My advice to the restaurant. Fire the head chef and get a new menu, chef and ingredients. Everything else is working but the food is garbage."
2015-12-13,2.0,"Cincinnati, OH",Clouds Brewing,"I had a great time at this establishment. They had servers who were very knowledgeable about their variety of brews. I loved the crab balls (not in that way), and my dinner was great as well. They had trivia going for a large group and they seemed to enjoy it. It's in a neat part of town as well.When I got home, I let a variety of farts."
2015-12-13,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Rye Bar & Southern Kitchen,"My friends and I came here seeking an alternative to the standard Sunday Raleigh brunch. We were seated immediately - not a shocker, since the restaurant was empty - and I was really pleased with the interior. The windows were big but the furniture is dark wood and the lighting is warm, making it feel at once both convivial and sleek. I hated the clipboard style menus, which were cumbersome. Our waitress did not walk us through any of the specials; in fact, she was difficult to understand and quite reluctant to speak.We ordered drinks. The standard bloody Mary here is, as others have pointed out, on point. The rest of the drinks we had were extremely disappointing, particularly the Winter Garden, which was far too sweet and poorly mixed. For appetizers we split fried oysters, fried green tomatoes, and the RYE quesadilla.  The fried green tomatoes were a unanimous hit at the table. The fried oysters were very tasty and had a fantastic texture, and the accompanying remoulade was fantastic.  The quesadilla was pretty good, with the wonderful touch of an acidic drizzle on top.Half of the table got the short ribs mac and cheese.  This was quite good, particularly with the crunchy breadcrumbs distributed throughout.  The sides were profoundly disappointing. The roasted root vegetables, despite their potential for adding a wonderful kick to balance out the standard Southern flavors of all of the entrees, were rubbery and bland.  The braised fennel and red cabbage was boring mush. I regretted my dish. I did not have a chance to tell the waitress this, as she did not appear in our area until a half an hour after we first received our food. My boyfriend ordered the honey fried chicken biscuit and found himself profoundly disappointed; again, it was too sweet and not flavorful enough.Dessert menus were brought out for us to examine, but 40 minutes passed until our waitress showed up. It's ok, I didn't want anything anyway: it was all the boring token chocolate, token apple, token white chocolate ""let's be bad"" dish, yawn-I-can't-keep-reading-this menu. Eventually we got our checks, and thankfully departed - over 2 hours after our initial reservation start time."

2015-12-13,5.0,"Garner, NC",MachuPicchu Peruvian Cuisine,"In the interest of full disclosure let me preface my review with the fact that I left Machu Picchu before my entre arrived but after the chef/owner was rude enough to my wife to make her cry.I decided to try Machu Picchu since my favorite Peruvian place Inka closed.  Machu Picchu is located in a non-descript strip mall.  The décor is a bit above what you would expect in a strip mall. the tables and chairs are wooden but the napkins are paper.  The menu prices on the other hand were definitely higher that what I would expect for a restaurant in a strip mall, ceviche is $13 to $18 and Lomo Lomo Saltado is $21.I ordered the Tamalito Verde for appetizers.  The menu says the Tamalito Verde is,""Tamale made with fresh corn and cilantro, stuffed with cheese and wrapped in corn husk"".  What I got was just a square of steamed green masa.  At $9 I can't say I would recommend it.  I also ordered the Ceviche Mixto.  I love Ceviche it is one of my favorite dishes.  I get it whenever I go to a Peruvian restaurant.  Ceviche is the dish I will judge a Peruvian restaurant on.  The Ceviche I got at Machu Picchu was definitely in the bottom five worst I have had.  I ate one piece of shrimp and it I had mealy old texture that seemed like it might have been frozen more than once or thawed too quickly.  It didn't have the crisp pop I have come to love in ceviche.  It also didn't have the burst of bright citrus flavor I expect.  At $15 for a relatively small plate I expected a whole lot better.  This would be where our experience at Machu Picchu went in a very odd and unexpected direction.  After my one bite of the Ceviche I called our server over and told her we were very unhappy with the Ceviche.  She said she would get the chef.  The chef came out and explained to us that we did not know what Ceviche was supposed to taste like and questioned if we had ever eaten it before.  No sorry you didn't like the dish let me try and make it better just an argument about how I didn't know what I was talking about.  Given my years of experience as a cook there was no way I was going to eat anything prepared out of my line of site by someone clearly unhappy with me.My wife volunteered to go tell our server we wanted to settle up and leave since I was a little too irritated with the chef's attitude to speak with them.  The chef/owner continued to berate my wife in front of the entire restaurant about how we didn't know good ceviche and that they were not about to take it off the bill, embarrassing my wife to the point of tears.  Oh and I would add they most definitely did not take anything off the bill.  I just don't think that making your customers cry is an appropriate way to behave when you are asking $30 or more a head for dinner in a strip mall.I can only assume from the way the chef/owner responded to our complaint and the food quality issues I encountered that the restaurant must be struggling.  I wish them the best of luck."

The lovely little fries with garlic parsley bits served in a mint julep silver cup with luscious aioli. What a wonderful way to toast the holidays!  Magnifique! (TIP:  You MUST share them with someone special- you'd die if you ate them all yourself...)Have anything on the menu in between but be sure to finish with a classic French pastry for dessert! The new pastry chef Jeremy hits it out of the parc with the Pear Tarte Tatine!  Oh!la la!

All of them were delicious. The red bean rancheros' crunchy chips stayed crunchy throughout the entire dish and all the toppings work very well together. Chicken waffle is even more delicious than the other famous ones I have had around the triangle, maybe because of the honey instead of syrup. Price: Most brunch items are under $10 and the portion is quite large/filling.Parking: Free parking lot right beside Beasley on the weekend!I would definitely return again to try the macaroni square"

2015-12-13,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Rise Biscuits & Donuts,"Plan accordingly!  First time we went was at 1:30 on a Sunday shortly after they first opened in this location.  Sadly, not a drop of a doughnut remained (they close at 2).  They have a sign right at the counter that tells you which doughnuts they are out of.  It was full. Our fault though that we left empty-handed. Should have timed it better!Couple days later and Husband surprised me after work with some that were left-over from a business meeting.  While yummy, they weren't the ones I would have selected.   Plus, well, they had been sitting out for awhile.  We all know doughnuts need tender loving care if not consumed immediately.  #men at work, sighSo bring on Rise experience #3 and we've got the WINNER!  11:00 on a Sunday and while busy, they had lots of staff to get everyone taken care of at a nice pace...taking orders, filling orders, and a bunch more making things fresh.  Which meant, we got to take home the dream combo of pistachio-glazed, creme brulee and maple bacon. Now this gal has literally waited years to time it right to try a Rise creme brulee, and it was indeed worth the wait! Maple bacon was also what dreams are made of, and I hadn't even heard of pistachio-glazed, but may I say...brilliant!  All, so soft and fresh.  Perfect for sharing.Price-wise, at $2.50 each for both the creme brulee and the maple bacon, and $1.75 for the pistachio-glazed...I think that is super reasonable for the size and level of quality.We also noted some great-sounding biscuit choices including very unique ones like a Meatball Biscuit with Coconut Curry Sauce.  And Husband was eyeing the brisket biscuit and Jane Dough's famous potato hash cake with cheddar cheese for future reference (too bad we had already had breakfast).Do note that there's a very limited amount of seating available (both inside and out), so be prepared to grab and go."

2015-12-13,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Buku,"I have been here briefly on a busy weekday evening once before in the summer and sat outside. We split a few things like the jamaican lamb patties and duck larb. Both were pretty good, but only until a few days ago did I feel like I got the full buku experience! We came for my birthday since I am a lover of variety and trying new things when I eat. Buku delivered and then some. We sat at a table by the bar which features a beautiful mirror waterfall and plenty ofH beautiful string lights on the ceiling. Our waitress was a little over enthusiastic and babbled a lot, but it didn't really detract from the experience. We tried quite a few small plates, but I would like to just share the ones that really stuck out. The pear salad was amazing, and so were the crab flautas. My friends split a steak dish which I tried; cooked medium rare and just melted in your mouth. Yum! The thing I didn't really care for were the japanese deviled eggs; 9 dollars for three so that's 3 dollars per half egg. Pretty outrageous but oh well. The philipino lumpia were okay, but had barely any filling in them. After dinner we topped things off with the halo halo for me, and my friends tried the tiramisu and creme brulee trio. The tiramisu was on the plain side in my opinion, but a novelty item nonetheless. The creme brulee trio was okay, but be warned that the chocolate one is extremely bitter! The halo halo was AMAZING and I would come back just for it. Overall, I love the idea and ambiance of this restaurant. Go find what you like!"
2015-12-13,5.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Beasley’s Chicken & Honey,"This restaurant does chicken and waffles right! The Ashley Christensen restaurant group doesn't fail to deliver. The fried chicken is perfectly battered to a crispy perfection on the outside, and still moist on the inside. For sides, I would recommend the macaroni and cheese custard - its a dense and pimento cheesy. We had quite a long wait for brunch so be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes if you are going during peak brunch hours on the weekends."
2015-12-13,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Station,"The Station is VERY consistent. Great food. Horrible service. I usually judge a restaurant only on their food as I'd rather have good food than good service.If I was judging the station on food alone, I would rank them a four or five. We love the bacon pimento cheese dip, sloppy joe, and the Station burger. They have good wings and crispy battered  chicken fingers. The food is always good.The service however is always terrible. The first time we went there we thought it was just an off night, times 2-6 we started to see a pattern.  We've been probably 20 times and the service is always terrible, but the location is convenient and the food is good so we keep going.Just know if you're going here, it won't be quick, you probably won't get any drink refills, if you ask for extra sauce it probably won't show up, but the food will be good when you get it."

I was celebrating my birthday and I got a WHOLE pound cake that is delcious and perfect for sharing with at least 5 or more people.

Something about the freshness of the lettuce, tomatoes and pickles just mesh well with the bun and that tasty chicken. PDQ has found another convert. Word to the wise: make sure the bag is open for takeout. All that steam lends to a soggy bun and fries; at least you know it's hot !!"

2015-12-14,5.0,"Durham, NC",Angus Barn,"Angus Barn is the staple steakhouse of the triangle. Its always a blast even walking around in this place. Its almost like walking around in a museum type of amazing. Upstairs they have a great bar area to sit around while you wait on your table with an incredibly AMAZING wine selection Ask to take a tour of their wine cellar if you can, it is awesome! You can't go wrong with entrees here. My favorite is the combination plates as it is rather pricey. I usually order the prime rib and ribs combo or the filet and ribs combo. You won't be disappointed! We also order raw oysters as an appetizer which are also great. They give you a selection of breads and cheese spread while you wait which you can go get yourself as it is unlimited. Be careful though because you never leave this place hungry so don't fill up on the bread even though it is delicious. If possible, try to come here during the Christmas season as it is always decorated so beautifully inside and out. Definitely a great special occasion steakhouse to go to. Its always an experience eating here!"
2015-12-14,5.0,"Lumberton, NC",Angus Barn,"We go to the Angus Barn annually for Christmas. This year upon coming home, my husband got violently sick. He complained that the spinach salad was terrible and that he had thrown up all he had eaten at Angus Barn. He was the only one at the table who got the pork ribs and spinach salad and the only one who got sick. I called the next morning and spoke with the food manager who took down my information and my husband's situation. He asked what he could do to make it right and I said I would like to be compensated for our meal as it was not cheap! He informed me a general manager would be calling me the following day. The assistant general manager did call and basically said he was following protocol to check on my husband. I asked if he would be able to comp his meal and he said no, not unless others reported a sickness. It seems that is just poor business because if we complained at the restaurant about service/food- it would be promptly taken care of and more likely comped! Also, upon talking with other friends- it seems that others have had similar experience with food poisoning from the barn. This was a night that was supposed to be enjoyed with friends. We will not be back!"

2015-12-15,4.5,"Durham, NC",Kai Sushi and Sake Bar,"On the hunt for my favorite sushi spot I added Kai to my investigation after finding them here on Yelp. We called the restaurant to make reservations for this past Saturday night, which I highly recommend. Another couple arrived the same time without reservations and waited about an hour as this place is on the small side and very popular. No BOGO sushi here but as others have stated they offer a nightly special of 3 rolls for $24 and 5 rolls for $37. If you do the math $7.40-$8 a roll is a great price and 5 rolls was plenty for the two of us. I enjoyed the fact they offered Kirin and Sapporo beers as well as a wide variety of Sake to include Nigori, which is my favorite. If you're a sake connoisseur you might want to check them out. Even though their list was small they have bottles ranging from $12-$100 as well as your typical hot sake on ""draft"".  My husband ordered a sake flight which was made up of 4 pre-selected types ($11) and the mango sake was hands down the winner.  Service was on par with how busy the place was and we were given complimentary edamame while we waited for our sushi. As for sushi they offer a few rolls with black rice which I've never seen before.  Personally I didn't think it tasted much different from white but interesting none the less. The sushi overall was good with the Kai Special being my favorite. Interesting combinations, decent size, and made with fresh ingredients. My only complaint about the sushi was they weren't tightly rolled. The table next to us ordered some bento boxes which looked delicious so we plan on returning and trying some of them. Want to give thanks to the Yelp community for sharing this place, great find."

I was with a large party and requested that the food be brought out as it was finished, to avoid receiving cold food. I was assured that this would occur. Unsurprisingly, the food was cold! I ordered the shrimp and grits, which should not be consumed cold. This is the second time that this has occurred. The restaurant offered to bring me another dish, I declined. In addition to me, three others in my party sent their food back for the same reason. I guess I will have to find another breakfast restaurant."
2015-12-15,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Wakefield Tavern,"The wings were fine. Basic sauce, I ordered the hot flavor. They were crispy, exactly how I wanted them. The ranch sauce was good. In the future I will try another flavor of wings beside the hot."

2015-12-15,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Flying Saucer Draught Emporium,Great beer (draft and bottles) selection and all the staff that I have encountered has been very friendly and knowledgeable.  I've eaten here once and it was pretty good and reasonably priced.  I like that it is a more casual atmosphere in downtown Raleigh.
2015-12-15,5.0,"Durham, NC",Bida Manda,"Definitely 5 stars! This place is so unique, and interesting. It's super cute on the inside. We came for lunch, and it was pretty popular with the Raleigh lunch crew. I now know why.Came with friends and split a bunch of different items: a pumpkin curry dish was a special that day (to die for), the soup appetizer was awesome, and the short ribs were definitely worth trying. They also serve a wonderful cup of sweet coffee at the end of the meal that rocks!"
2015-12-15,4.0,"Wake Forest, NC",Nashers Sandwich House,"My husband and I tried Nashers today.  Arrived at 11:30 before the lunch crowd so no problem finding a seat. Based on the reviews here, I had really high hopes.  We might give it another try but have to say our first time visit sure didn't wow us.  We tried the Pressed Caprese and Nashers Fried Chicken sandwiches, Fries and Cast Iron Corn.  The corn was really good but I thought it would be served hot and not lukewarm.  The fries were absolutely awful. Limp, limp, limp and greasy and certainly not hot.  Not sure why since waiting on them to come after our sandwiches, I assumed they would be fresh hot and crispy.  What a let down.  The Caprese was just ok -  it was overpowered by the combo of pesto, balsamic and garlic aioli.  It sounds good as written but it was smothered so Maybe limiting the condiments to one would be better, or give the customer the choice.  The Fried Chicken was good but it was missing the cheese and it had way too much THICK CHEWEY bacon on it which It took away from the star of the sandwich, the chicken."
2015-12-15,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Morning Times,The drinks were delicious and the atmosphere was nice. The food was alright nothing too spectacular and nothing too bad. If you just want a place to sit outside and enjoy brunch and people gaze this place is perfect :)
2015-12-15,4.0,"Cary, NC",Sitti,"Wonderful food and service. Finally had a chance to try it out after a nearby conference. Called to see if I could get a reservation and they were booked, but they told me I still had a chance to snag a bar table without a wait. Luckily, they were spot on and we got a seat right away. One of my colleagues was looking for gluten free options and there was plenty for her to try. I had the Sweet Potato Kibbe as a starter and was practically licking the plate. My main dish was the spicy BBQ shrimp. I couldn't finish it because I had already eaten so much sweet potato, but my colleagues tried it and were raving about it, in addition to their own meals. I'll definitely come back and even attempt to take my picky husband. I'm sure he'd easily find some tasty options based on their generous menu."
2015-12-15,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Jose and Sons,"Really LOVE this place. Tried it out last Friday and accidently made an error where I said 2 people instead of 4 for the open table reservation. The hostesses at first seemed a little flustered but they worked it out quickly and we were sat in 5 minutes. The salsa, guac and chips were super fresh. I would recommend ordering the guac (chips and salsa are free but the guac is extra).I ordered the Enchiladas Del Mar and they were amazing (check out the attached picture). I then unfortunately left them at Boxcar after. Womp womp. Our server was great, very personable and attentive. Will be back very soon!"

2015-12-15,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kamado Grille,"If I could give six stars, I would. And it is the service that was hands down the best and most friendly/accommodating. Interesting, too, since their model uses an iPad. You would think the service would be lacking, but definitely not the case. I asked way too many questions and the server was beyond helpful and even brought a special iPad to check allergies with me. The way you place an order is great and the amazing part about the ordering system is that you can add or subtract items from your menu at any time. It's genius. You can also check out/pay whenever and don't have to wait on anyone to bring your check. And the food- amazing. The ribs and chicken were our ordered entrees. The apricot chipotle bbq dipping sauce was sweet and spicy, the ribs had a great smoky flavor and really tender. The chicken was also more juicy than I would have expected.When you order, the electronic menu also suggests drinks based on the food, which is awesome. The Argentinian Malbec was perfect.Top rate."

2015-12-15,4.0,"Parker, CO",Bida Manda,"My boyfriend and I went here when we were in town for vacation. A friend recommend it and I have to say I've been thinking about it ever since. Start off with the Rosey Smash for a cocktail and soft shell crab for the starter. These two things are both unique and amazingly delicious! I get that the lettuce wraps are very popular, but the crab was quite a treat. We ordered the green papaya salad with sea bass and the beef basil stir fry for our entrees. They were both excellent. Finished the dinner with the sticky rice and again, delicious. Besides the crazy delicious food and adorable ambiance, our server, Cat, was so attentive, knowledgeable and definitely one of the best servers we've ever had. I would fly back to North Carolina just to dine here again."

2015-12-15,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Rise Biscuits & Donuts,"We went here around 1:15pm on a Sunday and it wasn't as crowded as I expected from previous reviews, but there were several people waiting for food.  They were out of a lot of donuts (as expected) but we got a raspberry jelly filled one and a maple bacon one.  I really enjoyed the raspberry one but I did not try the maple bacon.  We also got biscuits, I got bacon and pimento cheese which was delicious! I thought it was a little pricey for biscuits and donuts, I think it was around $23 for 3 biscuits (bacon/cheese, bacon/pimento cheese, sausage/egg/cheese) and 2 donuts, but still worth it for a weekend outing.  One thing I did not like about it was that there wasn't a lot of seating inside and the available seating was being occupied by people waiting on food.  We sat outside and there are 4 or 5 tables outside but it was pretty cold when we went and didn't enjoy sitting outside."
2015-12-15,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar,"I went here on a weekday night, so we didn't have to wait for a table. The crab wonton dip is amazing! I also got the bento box which came with a mini burger, a 4 piece sushi roll, and 3 sides (sweet potato fries, thai cucumbers, and edamame).  All of it was delicious, but the burger was actually my favorite so I wish I would have just gotten a full size burger.I really like the vibe in here and the large fishtank.  I think this would be a good place for birthdays or group, etc."

2015-12-16,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kabab and Curry,"I've been here for both buffet and a la carte ordering for dinner.  This is my inside-the-beltline go-to Indian place.   The buffet is pretty good.  It's not the largest or the smallest I've been to, but it has a decent selection.  There are a couple of sauces, pickled onions, salad, papadum, appetizer (usually pakora), plenty of veg and non-veg options, as well as dessert.  You get made to order naan (regular or garlic). It is from 11:30am to 3:00pm.  Get there early because if it's after 2pm and they run out of something, it's not likely they'll make more!"
2015-12-16,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chubby’s Tacos,"I've been on the search for great Mexican food in the Triangle for 20 years and love Chubby's.  They have great meat, especially the carnitas and amazing burritos.  Their tortillas are homemade and their salsas are some of the best I've had.  I'd rate it as good as Dos Taquitos, but more casual and much more affordable.  A line to the door is not uncommon, the secret is out!"
2015-12-16,3.5,"Dublin, OH",Gringo A Go-Go,Some friends and I ate here this past Friday night. I am usually not a huge Mexican fan but I must say this was my favorite in Raleigh. We ordered the chips and salsa with traditional pico and the peanut sauce. Both were excellent. Can't wait to try the jalepeno and chipotle salsas. We also ordered a cheese dip with chorizo and 7 different cheeses and it was also good. I ordered The chorizo and chicken tacos. The chorizo was by far my favorite meat. My friends loved the al pastor tacos. We also had a few margs which were tasty. Over all it was a good experience and I will definitely return.
2015-12-16,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Person Street Pharmacy,"I grabbed a late lunch today at Person Street Pharmacy. The menu is pretty limited which made for a quick decision. I ordered a pimento cheese sandwich and a side of chips (zappos, not homemade) to go. The service was quick and the sandwich was hot and a good sized portion. The restaurant is pretty small so it probably gets packed at peak times, there also isn't a ton of parking around so that may be tricky. I'll be back to try out the pulled pork sandwich soon."

2015-12-16,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sardi’s Den,Great food and service for a fair price. The ribs are great with their sauce. They're never packed so it's nice to have no wait time.
2015-12-16,4.0,"Youngsville, NC",Rise Biscuits & Donuts,"Sometimes when a business starts opening multiple locations at once, the quality of the product seems to go down.... but thankfully that is not the case with Rise!We ventured out to the new falls of Neuse location early one Sunday morning and were surprised to find that we quickly got through the line, and their product was just as good as at the original location. If you're looking for a fun place to catch a quick creative breakfast biscuits, and some good donuts give rise a try. They are a little pricey compared to some donut places,  and They're not exceptionally amazing but they are two thumbs way way up, especially compared to national chains, or what you'll find in the grocery store. My personal favorites are any of their  yeast donuts, but their cake donuts are also very good. Flavors are always on the move and changing so go often and see what creative things they have to offer!"
2015-12-16,5.0,"Cary, NC",Sassool,"Super fresh Mediterranean food and it is displayed in such a nice way that you can see the colorful salads and mezze items before you order. I would recommend a kabob platter with a few sides so you get a variety of meat and vegetables. Everything is made fresh and there is plenty of seating. You order, pay and then get a number to put on your table. The shop is also located next to the seating area and you can purchase all kinds of olive oils, cheeses, spices and Middle Eastern goods from all over. You can also purchase wine and beer and it is a great choice in the Six Forks area for fresh and healthy lunch or dinner."
2015-12-16,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Beasley’s Chicken & Honey,I visited here with individuals from my job. We arrived at opening time and I must say they fill quickly. The chicken was hot when we received it and was tasty. I ordered the chicken and waffle. I enjoyed the crispness the chicken had and the waffle was a standard belgian waffle. The waffle and chicken had honey on it and had a nice taste.

They have a good burger and their wings are excellent as well. I like the barbalo, Thai chili and spicy. We have ordered a chicken strip basket and wasn't disappointed with that either."
2015-12-16,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",42nd Street Oyster Bar & Seafood Grill,"Found this listed under dance clubs....totally the wrong category folks..It's a seafood restaurant ONLY.  The seafood is good (not awesome, just OK)  but overpriced given we can get seafood locally in hours, the prices should be lower.  Nice place to take a casual date or to eat out with friends before you hit the town, especially downtown.  If you call it a night from here, stop by Krispy Kremes on Person St. before heading home."
2015-12-16,2.0,"Cary, NC",Wicked Taco Raleigh,"To start, food quality is great! I love the fish tacos and the spices are very good.   I do not like the drive through section though, needs some serious work. I went through a few days ago and got chips n guac and a fish taco.  This order took them 6 minutes to complete which I think is way too long for a place that has everything pre-made. The time I went was at about 3:30, not a rush hour which is why I'm upset with a 6 minute wait time.   One other thing I have to complain about it the amount of food you get. The tacos are well priced and you get a great amount of food for the price. The guac on the other hand, is in a 3 1/4oz cup. They don't fill it to the top meaning you only get about 3oz of guac for an outrageous price. Chipotle charges 2 dollars for extra guac, in a 4oz cup 90% of the time filled to the top. The chip quality is also absolutely terrible at wicked taco, I don't recommend it.   Conclusion: Don't get chips and guac but get everything else because it's well priced and Tastes amazing."

Looking for a classy venue with excellent food and service, make reservations here."
2015-12-16,1.0,"Baltimore, MD",Angus Barn,"The food was amazing, and the ambiance was perfect for the holidays. They handed out free gingerbread cookies at the entrance, which made dinner already awesome from the get go. We were seated at the loft, on the second floor, which was perfect for a catch-up session; not too loud, not too dim. We ordered the ChateauBriand for two, which was actually enough for three people. It was delicious paired with a dry red wine."

I'll be back!"
2015-12-17,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Brookside Market & Deli,"I ordered delivery this time from Brookside. It is super close by and convenient for me. Though it is right down the block it took about 50 minutes for the pizza. I called around 1 pm..The pizza is NY style and very good though! Very hard to beat based on convenience. I usually stick to the basics and order a large half cheese, half pepperoni. The cheesesteaks are the bomb too though. I have been to the location as well, and I'll be honest, it is a little rough around the edges.. Not usually somewhere I would have given a chance, but I'm glad I did!"
2015-12-17,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chopstix Gourmet and Sushi Bar,I've only had take out from here and not delivery. Food was good but nothing that sets them apart from your average Chinese restaurant.

2015-12-17,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Donatos Raleigh,Donatos is the kind of place you either love or you hate.  I have tried several menu items from there and they have my vote...I love them!  Every time I have gone in store the staff is always so friendly and attentive.  They make sure they keep you updated on the progress of your order and always offer a smile.  I have had delivery also in the past and they are pleasant as well.  This particular visit I had pizza and wings and everything was cooked just right.  As long as they keep up the good work they have a faithful customer in me.
2015-12-17,5.0,"Minneapolis, MN",Tupelo Honey Cafe Raleigh,"Fell in love with Tupelo Honey as a student at UNC-Asheville. Their downtown Asheville location always had a line out the door but was always worth the wait. The sweet potato pancakes were a steal. I was happy to see that one of my favorite restaurants made its way to Raleigh, my home town. The food does not disappoint but I feel the prices have gone up. Also, the atmosphere is nice but nothing like the charm of DT Asheville."
2015-12-17,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",MachuPicchu Peruvian Cuisine,"What a great find. We took our two small kids and survived without issue(which is rare)! Very friendly waitstaff and the chef came out to talk a couple times.

2015-12-17,5.0,"Fort Lewis, WA",The Fiction Kitchen,"This place wowed me! I travel a lot due to my job and always Yelp Vegan places before I landed anywhere. I found The Fiction Kitchen & so happy I did. My fellow Yelpers did not disappoint in their recommendations for this place and specific menu items...especially the ""Chicken"" & Waffles.   Seriously,  you just can't go wrong with this choice!!! It tastes like what I remembered fried chicken tasted liked. The waffles were perfect too! The service was great & attentive, but not too attentive (you know what I mean)! There was a bit of a line for dinner, but we didn't have to wait long. My only suggestion is getting there earlier for dinner, because certain items sell out quickly! The only positive to certain things running out is I want to come back soon to get a chance to try it! This place would be great for friends getting together or date night too! Hope you get a chance to try this place!"

Exceptional Mexican food, and I am from Arizona and go to Mexico 3-4 times a year so I have found it hard to enjoy Mexican cuisine in North Carolina...but I have been to Jose and Sons 3 times now and I thought I ought to give them a review.This time I went I had the Chile Relleno and it came with a Brussels spout salad behind it. The chile was stuffed with a ricotta cheese mixture and yummy things...well I polished off my plate. 2 friends ordered the Enchiladas and also polished off their plates! I also had the flan for dessert and it was delicious!! I love flan and this was up there in taste! It came with a berry whip cream relish on the side that was yummy! My friend ordered the Tres Leche and I tried that also which was equally yummy!! Definitely worth going to!"

2015-12-17,5.0,"Morrisville, NC",Gonza Tacos y Tequila,"The ambiance is festive and lively. It reminds me a lot of Dos Taquitos in terms of the ""chaotic"" decor. I ordered the chicken fajitas and my friend ordered the Mexican Flag enchiladas. The food was pretty good. The enchilada's sauces were each unique and tasty. The chicken fajitas were okay. What I was not okay with was the service. Our waiter couldn't get us out of there fast enough. So fast that we weren't done with the food before he tried to clear the table and decided for us that we didn't want any leftovers.Good Mexican food in the Raleigh area is hard to come by. This is a bit away from where I live and had I been blown away I would be wiling to drive up there. If I happen to be in the area I would go again but not something I would make a special trip for."
2015-12-18,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kimbap,"I love Kimbap. Relatively small menu, but a good number of vegan/vegetarian/gluten free options. For dinner I usually order the veggie dumplings and glass noodles. My fiancé is partial to the bimbibap with tofu or seitan (hold the egg). Taco Tuesday's are also pretty great: two tofu tacos and kimchi fried rice for $11. They have all sorts of specials and deals most days of the week. The service is friendly and attentive. They have an open kitchen so you can see the chefs work, which is pretty neat. But most importantly, their house made hot sauce is ridiculously delicious. I'm not usually one to put hot sauce on everything, but I do here. They really need to bottle and sell it because I would be their best customer."

I recommend going earlier rather than later simply because they will most likely run out of their daily features since they are always so delicious :)"

A few singles scattered about at the bar. Great beer selection for Bro's sans Hoes. The sandwiches were standard greasy things with crusty factory French fries. The noise level was beyond but still a cool place for single beavers and raccoons on the prowl. The hostess was super sweet

For the period of 4 months when my wife and I lived in Raleigh, we ate at Chuy's every other week as it really close to our temporary quarters. The chips and salsa and great. During happy hour, they also have free queso which was excellent. I really enjoyed the guacamole. We also enjoyed the margaritas. However, my wife and I never found a main dish we enjoyed. I tried at least 6 main dishes, and never really liked any of them. The last few times we went, we just did chips/queso/salsa, drinks and salads."
2015-12-18,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Vinos Finos Tapas and Wine Bar,"Six of us enjoyed a ladies night out at Vinos Finos. VF's webpage states that they are ""The Best Wine Bar in Raleigh, NC! Vinos Finos has the largest selection of South American Wines, delicious tapas and the best Argentine empanadas you'll find anywhere in Raleigh."" I liked this place--it was something different and fun, and we enjoyed good food and drink. Most of the group ordered wine flights, which were a huge hit. The beer selection is short, but it's a wine bar, so duh! We ordered seven dishes from the ""Small Bites"" menu including the hand-made empanadas and the truffled deviled eggs. Each was very good, my favorite being the truffled deviled eggs. I'm surprised to say what fell flat for me were the empanadas! Of all things! But maybe I'm learning the difference between Argentine empanadas and Colombian empanadas. We also shared an order of paella from the ""Larger Plates"" menu. Although this dish was much smaller than I expected, it was delicious. Very much on the spicy side, but delicious. Emphasis on spicy. It was spiiicy. After nine small plates (we did a couple of them twice) and an order of paella for the six of us, I left hungry. Next time I'll do a large plate for myself and live happily ever after!The acoustics are crazy, so we could barely hear each other talk. It was a mind-numbing din of parties and servers and bartenders, oh my! But it still somehow felt cozy. There are traditional restaurant-type tables, pub tables, and arrangements of upholstered chairs in addition to the bar. There are a few outdoor tables as well. If it weren't for the outrageous noise level, I would say it would be great for a first date or date night, but I'm not sure shouting in your date's ear is the best way to get to know someone. The service was a little slow--not so much the food, but our drinks and water were not tended to as well as I'd like after a long work week!Overall, I liked this place. I hope to hit it on a night that is less frenzied and try an entrée (perhaps a Friday night two weeks before Christmas was silly). I'll be back!"

2015-12-18,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Taverna Agora,"On Dec 17 I took my extended office staff, 24 of us in all, to Taverna Agora for a Holiday Luncheon.  This was not my first choice restaurant but I am so pleased we ended up there.I was able to pre-select a menu.  Traditional Sampler appetizer plate, Greek Salad (exceptional), and three entrees.  We had grilled salmon, grilled chicken, and traditional baked pasta.  All were excellent!  This was all served family style and there was more food than we could eat.  This was topped off with baklava and chocolate Granache (sp?) for desert.  We were seated on the enclosed roof, a really nice spot for our meal, and for future outings! The staff did an excellent job of serving us with skill and great cheer.  Thanks Donna for your hospitality!You can bet we will return!"
2015-12-18,5.0,"Sanford, NC",The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar,"Cowfish can be best described as Burger-Sushi fusion and creative burgers. They have several sushi rolls which use traditionally American food ingredients such as beef, pork, pickles, etc. When it works, it works really well. When it misses, it misses big. I had on sushi roll which had bison meat and it was borderline inedible. However, every other sushi rolls I have order has been excellent. They also have a extensive burger menu which fuses burgers with other types of food such a Greek, Italian, Mexican, etc. Again, much like the sushi fusion, sometimes it works really well and sometimes it misses. My favorite burger was the Lamb Burger, which had lamb, tzatziki sauce, feta, olive, onions served on a burger bun. It was excellent. However, overall their sushi is better than their burgers. Cowfish is quite pricy, especially the drinks. My wife and I usually ordered an appetizer and then split a sushi roll and burger. Without drinks our bill would be around $50. On Friday and Saturday night, expect to wait 45-60 minutes for a table of 2.  if you like sushi, you want to try Cowfish just for the uniqueness."
2015-12-18,5.0,"Southern Pines, NC",David’s Dumpling & Noodle Bar,Great service. Clean establishment.  Fast and friendly servers. Food was decent. Good price. Possibly would try again if we lived closer and we'd try their dinner menu.

2015-12-18,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Coquette Brasserie,"This place is a consistently good spot for some French cuisine. I've been several times for brunch, lunch, and to sit at the bar. I've never gone for dinner. I recommend the cheese plate or the French onion soup. Both are absolutely to-die-for small dishes. They have a beautiful, chic interior, with a lot of seating. Would have given this 5-stars, but I didn't love their seafood crepe. They use the tiny salad shrimp, and that ruins any dish in my opinion."

With all my kids in visiting for the Holiday, we ordered up Thai Green Curry Chicken, Red Curry Beef, Sesame Chicken, House Fried Rice, Sweet & Sour Chicken, Crab Rangoon and spring rolls. The spring rolls were the only thing that did not taste freshly made; everything else blew us away! We loved it all and were actually shocked to get the House Fried Rice freshly made and the Sweet and Sour Chicken was amazing and not the usual crap other places put out. They are fast and kind and I could eat there every week and just may be!"
2015-12-18,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Wicked Taco Raleigh,"I had to see what this place was about, since it is 5 minutes from the house. Wicked Taco has a lot of interesting reviews from the time it takes to order to the different types of tacos. Yes I will say it does take longer than expected for drive -thru, but I always wanted to know why. I asked about the time and found out that all their food is prepared to order. Fresh greens, chicken, sides, chips etc...and I'm actually thankful for that. If it takes a little longer for the order that's fine with me. I know every taco and fundido dip I have order taste great. Now I have had my issues from not getting everything I ordered. But Quincy the manager/shift lead helped with that and apologized for the mishap. I will definitely go back since everything has been explained. The Wolfie Taco is a game changer and you get a hefty meal."

2015-12-18,5.0,"Austin, TX",Wicked Taco Raleigh,"I REALLY wanted to like this place.  Moved here from Austin and have been dying for breakfast tacos.  Its a cool place...reminds me of wahoo's or other contemporary interiored fast casual.  HOWEVER, the service was so bad that it was overall a strange experience.  Website says they open at 6:30 am, they don't.  They open at 10:30.  I called to place a pick up order of tacos for my office and they refused to take it over the phone.  They said I had to order online.  I tried doing that, however the website is broken.  The manager talked to me like i was an idiot b/c apparently you have to order for pick up on another website.  After calling them a few times and trying online, I drove there.  Well they weren't open, despite what it says, so I had to sit there and wait.  I watched two people drive up to get breakfast only to leave b/c they weren't open.  I guess trusting the restaurant's own website is a bad idea.  When I finally did place the order it cost me $50 for 8 tacos and took forever.  The tacos themselves were alright.  Good heat in their salsa but I wish they made them with scrambled eggs.  They fry the egg and its just not the same."
2015-12-18,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Guasaca,"For cheap eats that tastes great, you need to go to Guasaca! I love to grab one or two of their arepas during my lunch breaks from work. I've had their steak and their pork arepas. Enjoyed both. I also love their chips and guasaca as a side. Very inexpensive. Can get two arepas for about $7. Note: if you going during lunch on a weekday, either get there early, prepare to stand in line, or order ahead on their website. I've seen the line 20+ deep."

Service was, In a word, excellent from beginning to end. Creative cocktails (grilled grapefruit margarita- mmm). Great selection of beers on tap (Red Oak - yum). Varied and interesting menu- a usually decisive person, I could not decide! I ended up ordering the Bangkok Shrimp Tacos. Oh my - so tasty! Food came out quickly, hot and well-presented. A great dining experience. I will definitely return!"

2015-12-19,4.5,"Raleigh, NC",Saint Jacques,"It was our anniversary. Angus Barn or something new. We decided to go to Saint Jacques. BAD DECISION. The waiter was so annoying I was ready to walk out. First he'd speak to us in French. Then he'd switch to a heavily French accented English which we still couldn't understand. He did this all evening. The food was mediocre. Teensy tiny portions. Lamb was five thin slices of meat half the size of a bandaid. Bread (house made ) came without a crisp,  fresh that day crust - obviously from the freezer. It was just so disappointing.  Dessert boring. Wine and drinks and coffee were just ok. Everything was so pretentious and OMG overpriced for what you get. NOT MEMORABLE AT ALL. For $200/2 people I want to be fed. Next year we'll go back to the Angus Barn."
2015-12-19,4.5,"Cary, NC",Soo Café,"Best KFC in this area..hmm, the only KFC( Korean Fried chicken) actually. Very very good. The combination of the crispy  skin, the juicy interior and fantastic sauces makes for one of the most sublime meal experiences ever! I liked both the soga sauce and the original although the family thought the original was a bit too sweet. The radish kimchi was very good also. Dont get the seaweed salad, small portion and very underwhelming. Service was prompt. Decor was a bit confused, with japanese, chinese and Thai elements all mixed together. The Korean pop on the tv was funny but a bit risque for little ones. Nice experience, will be back again when we need a fried chicken fix!"
2015-12-19,3.5,"Apex, NC",NOFO At the Pig,"The menu is tasty and consistent, using fresh local ingredients.  We've even coined the term ""Meatloaf Thursday"" because of their Thursday blue plate special.  Matt, in particular, is an awesome waiter/bartender whom we look forward to seeing.  Two stars are given for the rude and sullen little 17-year-old sour-attitude blonde dread-lock twit who works to seat patrons.  Back up to 5 stars once she's gone."
2015-12-19,3.0,"Apex, NC",Centro,"I used to absolutely LOVE Centro, but in the past year it seems there is a new owner who has diminished the menu and made renovations to add a night club space on the second floor at the expense of the restaurant experience during the day.  They even have tables directly below a new open staircase with no shielding (disgusting!).  I really hope they get their act together and bring it back to what it once was."
2015-12-19,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Vinos Finos Tapas and Wine Bar,"So my first and not to be last visit to Vinos was on a Friday night in December .  It was a big party night at Vinos Finos Wine and Tapas bar. We had a group of six and we were completely surrounded by very loud rambunctious partying groups of 10 or more. It was really loud with all the parties. Only a few groups of four were hanging at the bar.I really enjoyed the tapas, I like spicy food. Although a few of the ladies though the spice was a bit much, the rest of us though there could have been more kick.... So maybe the seasoning is just right on the tapas.We tried almost all of the tapas and explored different wine flights. The wine flights are a great way to explore different wines. Everyone tried a different flight. Love the flights and all the catchy names. The paper guide for your wine flight was a great way to keep track of the wine that you you like, and you can take it to a wine store, if you'd like to by a bottle to enjoy at home."
2015-12-19,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",PDQ,"The food here is pretty good. Definitely better all the other fast food restaurants. I would say it's up there with Chick-fil-a in quality. The food is fresh and made to order. So the food is good, I just wasn't blown away by it. The place looked really clean and the staff was really nice. I liked the idea of a hand washing station outside of the restrooms. Made it really easy for me to just go and wash my hands really quickly. It's nice that they have a lot of choices on sodas and teas. I would definitely choose this over most fast food restaurants."
2015-12-19,2.0,"New York, NY",Sitti,"Good atmosphere, decent prices. However, the food here was far from being authentic. Ordered the lamb and beef shwarma and the soup of the day. They soup tastes and looked like it was from a canned soup. I could tell they didbt make the soup by the way it looked and years of working in the kitchen. The main entree lacked in everytbing, beef was over cooked and I could not tell if it contained any lamb. It had no flavor not even enough salt to taste and the rice that came with it was a joke. It was my first time there and will also be my last."
2015-12-19,5.0,"Portland, OR",Waraji Japanese Restaurant,"I am visiting family in Raleigh and my sister and brother swore up and down that this is the best sushi place in Raleigh. Waraji has some traditional Japanese tables where you sit on the floor. We decided to sit in one of those booths, which was fun for me since I never had done that before. Our server was not fluent in English enough for me to ask questions about whether certain menu items were vegan. After asking a few questions about the agedashi tofu and miso soup, it was clear that she didn't understand me. I left the table and found a fluent English speaker who was more than happy to answer my questions. Neither of the above were vegan. The miso soup is made with fish stock, but the server had said there was no fish in it. The ""other guy"" who wasn't our server did help me out a lot though, so I am giving an extra star for his effort. I was pretty disappointed by the food though. I ordered the yu-tofu (tofu and vegetables in a seasoned broth) which was okay but super bland, even with the ponzu sauce added in. I also had the inari nigiri (somehow super dry), an avocado roll, and a pickled Japanese vegetable roll. I've honestly had better vegetable sushi rolls from the grocery store back home in Portland. I would definitely push my family to go elsewhere if they wanted to go out for sushi again. Overall, my food was pretty disappointing, but the ambiance of the restaurant was nice and ""the other guy"" was super helpful and friendly."
2015-12-19,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Raleigh Times Bar,"This place has a good atmosphere. They play great music and the staff is friendly. The problem I have is with the food; its subpar. I ordered a medium cooked burger with fries. The burger was way over cooked. All I could taste was the char; it was completely burnt. Maybe I should order medium-rare next time? But regardless the burger was not good. The fries were alright, tasted like regular normal fries. I probably would not go back here again unless someone else invited me to go. Then I would give it another chance."
2015-12-19,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Plates Neighborhood Kitchen,"4.5 stars. My husband loves to try restaurants new to us, so when friends suggested Plates for a weekday dinner, we looked it up on Yelp and decided to give it a try. We are so glad we did! It's a relatively small place (especially when it's too cold for the patio, so you definitely want to make reservations). Nice ambiance, not overdone, trendy and upscale without being pretentious.We started off with some original specialty drinks that were really delicious. I asked for mine easy on the syrup (I don't like my drinks very sweet), and the server got it perfectly. I read the reviews about pretentious service: I found the service to be attentive but friendly.The menu changes based on local ingredients. I had an amazing short rib that was falling off the bone but not at all dry. Carrots roasted to perfection weren't at all mushy. I tasted the risotto and it was delicious. All four of us said we'd unhesitatingly go back again.Highly recommended."

Creamy cauliflower as a side is amazing also. Can be rich though so don't over order.Dig the wine selection. Bonus for carrying a Plavac Mali from Croatia."
2015-12-19,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Centro,"We went on a Friday night and thankfully I called ahead or else we would have waited. Small space with limited tables but the food was very good. They bring out a small hot drink that is meant to be sipped on and tastes like a corn/chicken broth soup. Chips and salsa are not free which was disappointing and why I'm not giving 5*. Service was good. Drinks were a bit on the high end as an average margarita was in the $11-12 range. I was pleasantly surprised that the taco plates were $12, even the shrimp which tends to be a few dollars more. We would go back again!"
2015-12-19,5.0,"Apex, NC",Trophy Brewing Company,"Delicious and interesting hand-crafted pizzas.  My favorite is the ""Most Loyal"" which has pesto, roast chicken, Roma tomatoes, and a slight honey drizzle on the crust.  The beer is their own micro-brew and they have several varieties.  My only complaint is that it is quite cramped, though fun to sit at community tables, and they aren't open for lunch during the week."

2015-12-19,1.0,"Fort Bragg, NC",Sitti,"Shared the ""Sitti Taster"" with my date. Dish consisted of: hummous, babaganouj, fattoush, chicken shawarma, kibbeh, and cheese rolls. ++ Babaganouj appropriately captures smokiness and smooth texture I'd expect from this dish++ Shawarma interestingly dressed with a tahini based yogurt sauce, very flavorful and tender++ Kibbeh formed into cones, very moist and loaded with pine nuts. Well seasoned too. -- Hummous way too dry, little lemon and no detectable garlic, leaving it bland and thick. Lebanese food is commonly known for it's heavy-handed use of garlic.  -- Fattoush was chunked, not even chopped. Three pita chips casually tossed on top. Suppose to be mixed, requiring a finer chop.Overall, solid food and great atmosphere. Service was acceptable. Perhaps growing up eating my Lebanese grandfather's cooking has set my expectations too high, but Siiti makes a faithful attempt at good Lebanese."

Festive ambience. I had the Poblano which was good and stuffed with shredded pork and surrounded by black beans and squirted creama, a great visual. My BF had enchiladas with Mole and he said they were like little blankets of penis love. My BFF had the tacos al Pastor and said they were fantastic. Even the chips and Guacamole and salsa were divine. The dishes are styled like a fashion shoot for Vanidades.   The Margs were the pucky and ducky. The place was loud as a good restaurant always is and the setting was a movie directed by Almodovar. Our server was from Venezuela and she was lovely and so sweet. If I had not been a gay man I would've asked her to run away with me and drink Casique. The evening was suave and zippy. Great place to get together with friends and a fun place to go to with just about anyone, even your worst enemy. The boys who work here are adorbs!  So come to the big G, eat, drink and check out the scene. The M Flag dish seems to be the winner."

It is situated on the corner of Blount Street and Wilmington with complimentary valet parking.When you walk in there is a hostess who was very pleasant and checked us in for our reservations. There were a few holiday parties going on and we were seated in a booth near the kitchen. Our server Joshua was amazing. Every server is not equal and i enjoy dining in places where the wait staff actually are passionate about what they are doing. Not only did Joshua give us excellent drink recommendations he suggested a few small plates to try.We ordered the rosemary nino and the pear fizz. Both were great options with fresh ingredients. For the small plates we ordered empanadas, filipino lumpia, and the tuna tataki roll. My favorite out of the three was the filipino lumpia. The cilantro chutney was nice touch on the lumpia.For our entree we decided to share the pan seared chilean sea bass which was excellent. I love sea bass and buku cooked it perfectly. For dessert we had the warm apple tart and the Larry's cold fashion to drink. Everything our server Joshua recommended was amazing and I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience."
2015-12-19,5.0,"Knightdale, NC",Standard Foods,"Number of visits prior to review: 6 - Staring opening week through December 2015Food: Solid dishes from tasty bite sized starters to larger entrees. A few of the small bites during my visit were underwhelming but all in all very high marks for the food. Quality is exceptional, seasoning was typically very good and only occasionally over salted. Much care has gone into the selection and preparation of the food during each visit. My suggestion is to stick with the small plates and bites and enjoy them as a meal along with a couple of cocktails. Their signature cocktails are generally very good and occasionally exceptional. Environment: The space is hip and vibrant. Expect a relatively noisy dining room. Overall acceptable noise levels but don't come here for an intimate dinner. They have been a little too greedy with their shared community tables in the dining room. It was a poor choice to offer so many bites and small plates while also packing your diners in so close together. While I have no issue with community dining tables I do not think it works with their menu and I suggest avoiding them until they resolve this. This issue is large enough to warrant a full star downgrade. The bar and smaller table seating is perfectly fine, use that when you can. Expect to park on the street surrounding the restaurant, there is plenty of it. Service: Taking a page out of the fine dining playbook they are very well staffed. In general my service was always good to very good with a couple of minor exceptions. In some cases no attempt was made to suggest that we space out our small plates, this resulted in some hot dishes being consumed cold later in the meal. That seems like a rookie mistake for a restaurant that seems focused on details. The bar tenders occasionally appeared inattentive missing opportunities to ask us if we wanted another drink or offering a check after we had long finished all our food and beverages. Relatively minor issues but again they stand out when everything else is good. The general attitude of the servers was very good, they seemed like they wanted to be there. That makes me feel like I want to be there and I give them high marks for that.Pricing: I would mark the pricing as fair. The quality of the food and effort of preparation seems fair for the prices asked. I paid a wide range of prices during my 6 visits depending on my selection and number of cocktails consumed. Overall: Standard is a good restaurant with considerable potential. The shared dining table experience seems like an obvious mistake but continues several months into service. There are plenty of serves which is good but some additional education would make them great. At any moment they could be one of the best things in Raleigh, I hope they get there."

It's a good size restaurant, but if you're interested in dinner on the weekend, you may want to reserve. We often eat here before going to the symphony, since it's within walking distance.

2015-12-19,4.0,"Durham, NC",Gonza Tacos y Tequila,"I have been dying to go to Gonza forever. I don't know what took me so long! I went with a group of nine. I had to make reservations in advance, and the woman I spoke with on the phone was wonderful. I got a call the day of to confirm and to ask me how the group wanted our checks done. We wanted separate so, at the end of our meal, we didn't have to say a word. We were just given our checks.As everyone has said, the food and service was amazing. I went with a top-shelf margarita using whatever tequila my server recommended. It was more than I normally pay for (13.00 a pop, and I had two), but worth every penny. Very smooth.For dinner, I had the Tinga Tacos with rice. The dish was a great deal (10.00), and the perfect amount of food. It was three chicken tacos with onions, and a side of green salsa, on small corn tortillas. By the time I had eaten them and my rice I was full, but not overly stuffed. Perfect!My group ordered a variety of options, and everyone was very pleased with their meal. Only one person had been before, and she was very excited to be back. We all agreed that we should return as soon as possible.The service was outstanding. Our waitress was very friendly and well organized. She knew the food (and tequila!) very well. One of the members of our group was gluten free, and our waitress explained this would not be an issue and that she could order most things. They figured something out, and she was very happy with her meal.This is a fun place with amazing food. I saw another reviewer said it was the best Mexican place in the triangle, it just might be!"

2015-12-20,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",MOD Pizza,"How does this place have 4 stars? Are they actually paying for reviews?  Fast food pizza reminds me of what Dominos would do if they opened a pizza restaurant where you could make your own pizza. They yell at you when you walk in the door which does not make the corporate pizza taste any better. They should yell ""Go get your Tums!"""
2015-12-20,3.5,"Creedmoor, NC",42nd Street Oyster Bar & Seafood Grill,"Hubby's office had the company Christmas dinner here last week.  It was a party of 16, so as you can imagine, we were a little needy.First, I will say that anyone that has White Street Kolsch on draft is my favorite bar ever.  I'm obsessed with it.  Obviously, this started my night out fantastically.  This is the only reason for my star detraction: despite having 3-4 waiters buzzing around our table, I had to ask for another round 3 times.  Part of me was scared that 3 were going to show up on the table, but only one came.  We all somewhat had trouble getting drinks, even the dessert drinks after our meal were forgotten for several people.Food-wise, everything we ordered was amazing.  I'm not a huge calamari fan, but theirs was amazing.  Not at all fishy, and somehow very flavorful without the batter being super salty.  The buffalo shrimp were nothing super exciting comparatively, but they were pretty tasty.  For dinner, hubby had the 12 oz ribeye with mixed veggies and cheese potato.  I had the surf and turf petite filet and sautéed shrimp with mixed veggies and cheese potato.  Our steaks were cooked to perfection, and it is probably the best filet I've ever had--the kind where you don't ACTUALLY need the bacon to add flavor, but its nice.  I can not sell the cheese potato short, either.  It's a side they're apparently known for, and one you absolutely must try.  I'm warning you, however, its at least as much cheese as potato!We were all super stuffed after all the entrees, so no one tried dessert, but they looked great. Maybe next time!"

The order: RibsShaved Ribeye Sub w/ friesCaesar SaladRibs: I gather this is their pride and joy. My stepdad seemed to enjoy them. Fair enough. I tried some and here's my take. No rub, no smoke, no flavor profile. Game over. I can live with a GREAT sauce lifting them up, but the bourbon sauce wasn't it. Reminded me of Montgomery Inn ribs in Cincy. Local favorite, never understood the love.Shaved Ribeye: At 16.95, one would think, now this is something special. So I open the styrofoam container. WTH! This dinky little sub roll... this is the vehicle for my scrumptious 17 dollar steak sub? I split the roll to peek inside. Jeez, Sardis??? Wait for it .... 'where's the beef??'. Oh man, what a downer.I was splitting this with my mom and I think it was gone in four bites. Tasted okay to me, but now just a fleeting memory. My mother didn't care for it at all.Caesar: Romaine had lots of brown on its cut edges. Croutons and Parmesan tasteless. Very good dressing, but picking through the lettuce killed it. Really no excuse for that. My mother wouldn't even try it, and she loves Caesar salads.Service: We arrived on time for pickup and I sat idling in my car for 10-15 minutes while the stepdad was in getting the food. Let's wrap it up shall we - it's Xmas, the season of giving. Consider my order to you as my Xmas gift Sardis, but don't expect (even) a card next year.2 stars - the stepdad liked the ribs, and good Caesar dressing."

I love the hip, adventurous and outdoorsy vibe, and the displays of bikes in the retail area. I've never seen a store with the combination of cafe and gear, and this place pulls it off perfectly with a cool but down-to-earth vibe. The employees are all very friendly, and the prices are relatively steep but not overpriced for what you get and the unique offerings. Coffee here is great too."

2015-12-20,1.0,"Tucson, AZ",Joule Coffee,"If you miss this place while walking down the side walk, don't worry, you didn't miss much. My first thoughts walking into the hipster joint was ORANGE. Orange all over the place. When I sat down and soaked in the surroundings, the decor tried to go for a ww2 coffee theme. Great blend for the hipsters, they dated themselves back to the 40's before it was cool...I guess? Anyways, I'm in it to win it, so I ordered a Peppermint Chocolate Latte. (That was my 2nd mistake, first one was walking in the place.) It came out with a nice artistic design (Hence the 2-stars), and tasted like crap with no peppermint.  Thinking about it, I've never tasted, or tried, a liquid turd presented so nicely. I may give this place 3-stars just for that experience.Pros - it's a quiet place Cons- coffee is a blend of tastelessness and/or crap."
2015-12-20,4.0,"London, United Kingdom",Bida Manda,"How to beat a dead horse: Review Bida Manda... apparently. I didn't actually realize this place was so popular until I decided to review it for yelp. I am not a Raleigh local but my sister is and apparently prides herself in being pretty popular among the ""elite"" of Raleigh (whatever that means). She reserved Bida Manda for her rehearsal dinner and I was pleased, though not surprised, to find an upscale mod and chic looking Asian restaurant. Not that I'm knocking on Asian restaurants but many of the ones I have reviewed are often and colloquially referred to as ""holes in walls""  with great food.Though, in hindsight I doubt my sister would book one of those kinds of restaurants for the rehearsal dinner... Yet I digress.The place was gorgeous and dimly lit and elegantly decorated with bamboo and canvas photos of Laotian monks. Though the meal was already set, I managed to convince my husband to get a few cocktails off of the drinks menu (I meaaann, we aren't paying for this right?!). I had a hazelnut manhattan, which was a deliciously nutty balance between the hazelnut and vanilla of the bourbon. Evidently, not my husband's type of drink so note: If you are not a fan of sweet cocktails maybe stray from this one, I don't think you can really go wrong with the cocktail menu. Moreover, if you're feeling something just describe what you want and maybe the bartender or waitress will be able to help you out. The food though was phenomenal. I expect nothing less from my sister and her choice in food. Though I don't remember the whole menu the two things that really stood out to me was the Crispy Pork Belly soup. It's kind of like a vamped up Laksa with Kaffir lime leaves, coconut  curry broth, and rice noodles all topped with crispy pork belly. The only words to accurately describe it is the Homer Simpson drool/gargle spelled, I believe, ""Aauaughghrrhghgaahghgghhalaaughghahagh."" The other standout meal was the dessert selection where the was a very typical Asian dish of sweet and sticky rice with coconut custard which was gorgeously balanced so that, unlike continental fare, the dessert was not overwhelmed with sugar that you lost the subtleties of coconut. I really enjoyed my first time here at Bida Manda and I don't suspect it will be any different when I beg my sister to take me there again on my next visit. The food was amazing, the drinks went down easy and pleasurably, and the staff were incredibly friendly. Unfortunately, I didn't pay for it so advising on a fair price would be really dumb of me. But if you've got the money and aren't averse to coconut and are looking for something a bit exotic and different for a dinner date idea, I would highly recommend Bida Manda."

I wouldn't want to be working at this place either."
2015-12-20,1.0,"Kenwood, Chicago, IL",Chuck’s,"A perfect 5! Best burger in America! I ordered a dirty south burger which came with some sort of chili beans and other such toppings. It was good, and that's what counts. But what took this place to the next level was the dipping sauces. Each burger comes with not 1, but 2 dipping sauces! And ketchup doesn't count! I highly recommend the garlic aioli which rivals some of the best garlic sauces on the planet (i.e. Papa Johns garlic butter). Dump this stuff on your burger. That being said, the fries weren't good so don't order them. They are steak fries and steak fries aren't good."

They have a great selection of draft beers, this being the place where I had my first Yeti - my all-time-favorite dark beer. Their hamburgers are great, fantastic homemade chips, amazing onions rings. Okay, so why four stars instead of five? Because I would like to have a few healthier choices on the menu. Yes, they have salads, but that's not what I'm looking for. How about some salmon, some broccoli on the side, etc? Pretty much everything is fried and I really need to eat better, and I would if the choices were there."

But I have had poorly over cooked and dry burgers in the past and this was not one of those occasions.  I'm pleased to say that I believe any kinks the kitchen may have had in the past have been resolved...at least with the items we had yesterday.  We didn't try the pimento dip again as that was a huge let down last time but I'm willing to give it another go on future visits.  And last but not least the staff was very friendly.  I highly recommend The Station as a great place to hang out, dine & take out of town guests that want to get a taste of the local flavor."

The first time I went I did my best to order something I'd like, lamb in a sushi roll, but there was way too much white rice, and not enough meat. They did let me return it though, and I got a lamb burger, which was very good. When I returned with my family, we had a great dinner in a fun, packed environment, the only downside being that we were seated very close to the front door and I felt like we were in a main thoroughfare inside the restaurant. I definitely recommend Cowfish,  but could not quite give it a full five stars."

2015-12-21,4.5,"Durham, NC",Glenwood Grill,"""Delicious gourmet food & preparation in a Glenwood Ave. strip mall""Came by here for a short-notice lunch on a Monday. Although we arrived just before noon, the restaurant was packed-- literally not a single table available without a reservation or a spot at the bar, but they let us set up, order, and have bread along a counter with some stools. When a spot at the bar became available, they helped us move (and brought more bread). We both ordered the cajun fried catfish, which came with pimento cheese grits, collards, and pickled okra relish.Service-- excellent. Although packed, we were served quickly (though oddly by several different people), and never had any wait for anything, even paying.Quality-- wow, delicious! The bread that we were served initially was excellent-- soft and clearly very fresh. The main dish was very impressive. The catfish was perfect in all respects-- not too heavy, not overly breaded, not ""fishy""... it was just right. One minor weirdness is that it came out rather crazy-hot in temperature, but it was fine in a few minutes. The grits, collards, and okra were all fantastic, and I'm not even a big collards fan. As you'll see from all the pictures here in Yelp, they are also very good about ""appearance"" of the food, as well as taste.Quantity-- not bad. The price was $12, so I expected it to be a bit bigger than it was, but I didn't leave hungry at all. Just the right amount.Price-- not at all unreasonable given the quality of food and service.Setting-- fine. Not crazy loud given how crowded it was, but definitely ""full"". Overall, despite only a single visit, I'd have to say I'm a fan and would happily go back if in the broader area. Really no complaints at all-- don't see how it could've been better... I can see why it was so crowded."

Devolve has a bar, which is great to get a coffee and sit down to enjoy the cool atmosphere but it's not as much the main attraction here; the cool biker merchandise a la California west coast culture is. The staff is really nice and helpful. The merchandise seems to have the motorcyclist in mind - and you can find boots, leather jackets, gloves and even goggles here - but they have some great hipster/biker jewelry, some awesome gifts for be masculine person in your life, and cool flannel shirts and t-shirts.If you make this a weekend destination for a fun look-around, be sure to grab a cup of coffee and split a LucetteGrace pastry (which they carry from the wonderful nearby downtown Raleigh fine pastry shop) with a friend, enjoy the atmosphere and maybe go to a nearby restaurant for lunch afterwards.

2015-12-21,5.0,"Cary, NC",Relish Café & Bar,"Relish is located in the shopping complex next to the former Dos Taquitos location and it appears to have been a North Raleigh establishment for many years. I was surprised at how expansive the dining area was because it does not look like much from the outside.  The restaurant has a bar area when you enter and then a little shop area with local crafts and items for sale. The hostess took us to the dining room on the right and it was casual with wooden tables, booths and pictures of Venice and Paris on the walls. We were able to order from the regular menu and a menu that said ""Test Kitchen"". I opted  for the Bacon, lettuce and fried green tomato sandwich on toast with feta cheese. It was a very delicious sandwich and I have never had that combination before. The menu also offers many Southern comfort food dishes such as mac'n cheese skillets and grilled cheese sandwiches.  The house chips are also the perfect side and are made in-house. The drinks are served in mason jars with lemon and a straw and our waitress was always back to check on us and refill our drinks. I noticed in previous reviews that the brunch here is popular so I will have to come back and check that out one day."

I am going to have to learn to make something similar because it makes me sad that this amazing dish exists 3000 miles away from where I live. The apple fritters were amazing as well. I took a piece of vegan quiche with root vegetables back to my family's house and had that for breakfast the next day. It was also wonderful! Portland vegan brunch needs to step up its game, because this little vegetarian diner in non-veg friendly Raleigh is doing things right! We also had really excellent service.

2015-12-21,5.0,"Apex, NC",Rye Bar & Southern Kitchen,"Looking for a new place to go downtown on a Sunday afternoon before a show with my Mom and Uncle and came across this place. Ratings seemed OK and we looked over their website and decided to go. I don't usually go to a restaurant in a hotel (it is in the Raleigh Marriott City Center) because I know they tend to be overpriced, but we figured we would try it out. Well that was a mistake.  Our show was at 5pm so we came in at 3:30pm. Firstly, the decor is nice and modern and we liked it as we walked in. But when we went to the hostess stand we stood behind a couple and their young daughter and the the waitress came up and told them the dinning room was closed and they would have sit in the bar. She seated them and then we just took it it upon ourselves to take the last empty table. Not a horrible ordeal but just surprising. And we checked their website again, it didn't say anything about dining room hours. The waitress finally came to our table and was nice but we did express our disappointment with the dining room being closed. She apologized. Well the menu had enough variety for us so everyone found something fairly quickly...sort of. My Mom chose the Fall/Winter Sunday lunch special. This is off the Lunch menu that lists specials for all seven days of the week. When she went to order it the waitress informed us that the lunch special ends at 2pm. This time limit was also not listed on their menu or website. So I then I asked if they had a dinner menu but she said that doesn't start until 5pm. So if you come after 2pm and before 5pm, you menu selections will be limited and you will have to sit in the bar.We moved on and my Mom orderd the Lemon Thyme Chicken with green beans and herb roasted potatoes. The chicken was moist but surprisingly tough. The flavor was just OK. The green beans were fresh but flavorless and the roasted potatoes were basically two potatoe spears with some seasoning on them. Just ok.My uncle ordered the Short Ribs Mac and Cheese with coleslaw and green beans. The short ribs mac and cheese was pretty good but really rich. Coleslaw was a standard may based. Not too bad but not really good. I ordered the Cheerwine Spareribs with mac and cheese and green beans. The ribs were pretty good and tender, fall off the bone. The sauce was pretty good but a little on the sweet side. I expected it to be sweet because of the Cheerwine but it was just a little too much. Mac and cheese was good and creamy. I probably had the best dish of the group. For the price the portions were small.Overall we all were in agreement that we wouldn't come back. Given as a whole with the closed dining room and no specials, our experience wasn't that good. However, the wait staff was pleasant, a little slow on some drinks, but good overall. If it was just up to the food I wouldn't be back either. There are much better places to dine downtown."

2015-12-21,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Driftwood Southern Kitchen,"When I'm searching for a delicious brunch, Driftwood definitely comes to mind.... and their dinner isn't too shabby either! What's better than a southern style brunch buffet with delicious fresh entrees, salads, and desserts? They only do the brunch buffet on Sunday and I think it starts at 10:30 or 11. Located in Lafayette Village off Falls of Neuse in N Raleigh, this place gives you a good reason to come to this shopping plaza because it's just delightful.... the parking is a bit atrocious at times, but luckily there's a garage underneath the shops (it's free!). The ambiance is quite cozy with woodsy decor and metal accents- though I don't love the metal chairs bc they're quite uncomfortable. I love the hanging terrariums that separate the dining room, and they even have a huge semi-private area that can accommodate groups of 20+. The food is on point - it's that southern comfort food that you need and love on a Sunday morning. The brunch buffet is like $16-17/person (includes drink) and has a good selection of both breakfast & lunch options, two salads, a fresh fruit/yogurt station, and desserts. Their mac & cheese is quite tasty, but I loooove their garlicy cheese biscuits topped with southern gravy. It's a treat when the fried chicken is on the bar, and the bacon is thick & heavenly. The coffee comes on a cool wood cutting board with blocks of raw sugar & heavy cream - great presentation!We've been for dinner twice (once during restaurant week, which was a great deal FYI) and we tend to like the brunch much more. During dinner, they provide pork rinds as a light snack while you wait, which was really cool & unique. The food was great during dinner too but I never seem to drive up here in the evenings. I highly recommend giving either brunch or dinner a shot though :)"
2015-12-21,5.0,"Creedmoor, NC",Kamado Grille,"Ralph gave us great service, we had been seated right away after call ahead seating. The iPad ordering threw me off a little at the beginning but Ralph explained it very well. We started off with a NC brew of Mother Earth endless river Kolsch  & a Jim Beam old fashioned while we waited for our Lamb Lolipops and Oyster Kamadofeller  appetizers. The lamb was enough for four people to share and each person to have one succulent chop, it came with creamy grits and a scrumptious sauce. The oysters come out popping hot and once they cool down you'll be glad you didn't burn your tongue& the flavors will meld in your mouth. The dinner salad was a great break from the mundane, it had red peppers & radishes on it with a tangy Arnold Palmer dressing. The Caesar salad dressing was the only disappointment it was thin, but the salad was fresh. Dinner...woah! Miso salmon mmmmm it was so tender he could have ate it with a spoon. Paired with a tangy sweet coleslaw (you have your choice is sides), it was a good sized portion. I had the mushroom ragout side which was not greasy at all, a negative I have experienced at other restaurants. My entree was the reverse pork bomb which Ralph informed is their most popular item & I can certainly tell you why is it out of this world! The sauce is definitely bourbon sweet but the meat is so tender it is amazing! We finished our meal by sharing a piece of Key Lime pie that would do any Floridian proud, the whipped cream is delicate and homemade"
2015-12-21,2.0,"Garner, NC",Wicked Taco Raleigh,"Really fun and inventive menu. The tacos are so satisfying. The chips and salsas are a meal in themselves.

2015-12-21,4.0,"Morrisville, NC",Driftwood Southern Kitchen,"Love love love this place!Location is great and I highly recommend checkign out the other shops in Lafayette Village before or after you eat.I've been here twice and both times services was great.  Most recently we came in for a later dinner on a Friday night and Matt was our server.  Y'all he is THE BEST.  Attentive, respectful, fast, and thought of everything we needed before we had to ask for it.  Our table forgot to order our appetizer so I went up to find him and asked him if he could put in the pimento cheese appetizer.  He brought it to our table 60 seconds later!!! (And it was our fault we didn't order it sooner).I've gotten both the bibb/wedge salad and the arugula salad--both of which are great.  The mini biscuits for an appetizer and delicious and the maple butter they serve with them are what dreams are made of.  The pimento cheese appetizer is great, but it definitely comes with more spreads than crackers, but ask for more crackers and they will bring them to you free of charge.   Desserts wise, the mini donuts are very good, but I prefer their peanut butter pie with a pretzel crust--amazing.  Definitely try to get this brought to your table while your date runs to the bathroom because you will want a head start on this. They have a great selection of drinks and my favorite cocktail is their champagne and strawberries (champagne with strawberry moonshine).  The glass comes pretty full (and for only 8.95 for a cocktail, I fee like it is definitely reasonable priced).  BEWARE.  This drink makes you think you are just drinking champagne, but it can definitely do some damage since it is spiked with liquor.  It is so tasty.Parking can be crazy here so I definitely recommend parking underneath the village in the parking deck.  Also, it can get a little loud if it is busy so keep this in mind.Overall I love this place and will be back!"
2015-12-21,1.0,"Cary, NC",Gonza Tacos y Tequila,Great atmosphere and the food is just simply amazing. I've been here 4 times and tried something different each time. I left all four time extremely satisfied. I will continue to come back. One of my favorite place in the triangle.
2015-12-21,4.0,"Holly Springs, NC",Sullivan’s Steakhouse,"My husband and I came here for our 1 year anniversary, and we were not disappointed. They asked us right away whether we were celebrating a special occasion and we were congratulated multiple times throughout the meal. Our waiter was knowledgeable and attentive but not overbearing. Earlier that day, I had been perusing the menu online and saw that they had a 3 course deal for $42 and thought it looked very appetizing. However, I didn't see it on the menu when I got there, and we were given the menus for the deal after I specifically asked about it. I'm not sure if they typically try to encourage diners to order off the main menu or if that was just an oversight. We asked for a wine recommendation and he wasn't sure about a specific kind but asked his manager and gave us a great suggestion. Our water and bread was refilled often, and the food and service was awesome. We both order the 3 course deal for $42 each. The Shanghai calamari was fantastic, with a crispy light batter and sweet chili sauce, along with crushed peanuts and bean sprouts. My husband ordered the jumbo shrimp cocktail, which had fairly large shrimp, but only came with 3. The discrepancy between the two portion sizes was a little strange. At the end of the night, they said they covered the dessert we ordered and wishes us a happy anniversary again. It was a great experience, and we'll be sure to go back again."
2015-12-21,5.0,"Charlottesville, VA",Angus Barn,"I am a long time customer who just had one of the worse meals that I have had. The maitre D suggested the bar (single), I asked if the service was the same and he said yes. I was ignored for 15 minutes until I was able to flag down a waiter who took my drink order, I got my own menu, drink refill, and silverware after I was served soup (I wanted oysters but they were out). I asked for bread with the soup, but that didn't come until the entree. My Caeser salad came after the dinner was finished and I had to ask for that also. This was a $130, self-serve dinner for one. I doubt that we will return."
2015-12-21,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Nashers Sandwich House,Chicken meatball sandwich was superb.  Quality food. Will be back very soon.   Next time I'll try out the salads since they looked delicious when served to other tales.

2015-12-22,4.5,"Apex, NC",Second Empire Restaurant And Tavern,"We had reservations for dinner on Wed. Dec. 16th for the main dinning area and were very disappointed in the experience.  We have previously dined at Second Empire in the Tavern and it was excellent so we were expecting the same kind of meal and service.  The food was just so so.  We could have been eating at any number of restaurants.  When you make a reservation at Second Empire you expect more culinary delight!  Especially for the price.  The service was very poor.  It was not  extremely busy that evening, but there was a lot of lag time with our meal presentation. the two servers delivering the meal were borderline rude.  No inquiry if anything else was needed.  The main server was also not very attentive.  We had to ask another server to find ours so we could order dessert.  My husbands co-workers asked about the experience and they stated that they felt the same way when recently dining there.  The conclusion was that Second Empire has not been living up to its reputation the last year."
2015-12-22,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Square Rabbit,Reasonably priced. Free bumper stickers. Never messed up an order. Very inexpensive actually. Great quality. Nice shirts. Never can get enough.
2015-12-22,4.5,"Raleigh, NC",Tazza Kitchen Cameron Village,"Even having to wait awhile for a table when we did call ahead seating didn't ruin this place for me. Hands down this is the best restaurant I've had since moving to the Raleigh area. Everything was so. Dang. Good. For appetizers we started with chips and guacamole and the cast iron goat cheese. The guacamole was perfect as a starter because it was light and came out quick. The iron goat cheese was unreal. It reminded me of a homemade vodka sauce in a way and came with potentially the best bread I've ever had. The meal was off to a good start. For dinner we split the Brussels sprouts appetizer, kale and chile salad, and sausage and black pepper honey pizza. All were on point. The Brussels sprouts came with bacon jam and mustard seeds and were seated to sweet perfection. The salad with crisp with a light vinegarette and the pizza sweet and smoky. We cleaned our plates. Since everything else was so great we tried the caramel gelato and flourless cake dessert. Again- not disappointed. The environment is rustic chic and reminded me of a fun wine bar. Prices are reasonable and they have a great beer, wine, and cocktail selection.  Next time we hope to try the meatballs, cauliflower app, tacos, and crispy potato and arugula salad. So many choices so little time. Be sure to check this place out if you're in the area!"
2015-12-22,4.5,"Raleigh, NC",DeMo’s Pizzeria & Deli,"Disappointed heard so many good things decided to try my wife and I ordered Greek salad garlic knots and a small pizza. Friendly service and we were only two dining inside this Tuesday night not busy at all saw a delivery go out. Garlic knots were good Greek salad was good although no one tops Greek salad at Trophy Brewing. But the Pizza was so so guess maybe I am just not a fan of NY style pizza for me bottom of crust was overdone, overdone thin crust with little taste, pizza does not compare to Trophy Brewing.  I really wanted to enjoy this restaurant but pizza is not as good as papa johns it was disappointing."
2015-12-22,4.0,"Garner, NC",Thai House,"This is our hidden gem for thai. I took my toddler last week and had a good experience with him too. We weren't offered a high chair when we were seated, but he's lucky at the age he doesn't NEED one. I assumed they didn't have any, but a large party came in and used two. The spice level of food is customizable, and prices are competitive to other thai places nearby. I don't think I've ever been there when it's anywhere near busy, so it's a safer bet to get in at peak times."
2015-12-22,4.0,"Cary, NC",b.good,"Had a no good experience today. Ordered my food and the registers go down, I stand there for 30 min with my toddler why they try to figure it out. Meanwhile the line behind me backs up..,they start writing down the orders of everyone else. No biggie.  I am finally able to pay and sit down. Everyone else who was behind me and waiting half the time gets their food...wait another 15...no food. Finally I go up and ask (with screaming toddler) and the lady acts like she forgot I had even ordered! I finally get the food but they forget part of my order and they put my daughters kids meal in sideways so the whole bag is covered in applesauce. This was the worst part....I go to change my daughters diaper and NO changing table in the bathroom!!! I don't understand why restaurants don't have them...such a disappointment.  This was my fave place and j love their food so not giving less stars. I just wish they had been more sympathetic/customer oriented."
2015-12-22,5.0,"Charlotte, NC",Tupelo Honey Cafe Raleigh,"I LOVE Tupelo Honey Cafe!  My first visit was at the location in downtown Asheville, so I was a little sceptical about this location.  However, it was just as AWESOME.  The food was so fresh and delicious.  The Cider Glazed Salmon is THE BEST!  I got the kale greens for the side with it and it was the healthiest brunch ever.  Their Bloody Mary is amazing as well...definitely will recommend it to my true Bloody Mary fans out there.  The service is also very good."
2015-12-22,5.0,"Fairfax, VA",Mitch’s Tavern,Exceptional London Broil sandwich. Came with fries and a pickle.  I loved the old seats and the rustic feel to the place.
2015-12-22,2.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sassool,"I work by Neomonde in Morrisville and live by Sassool on Strickland. I eat at both locations every few weeks. My go-to dish is the chicken shawarma pita sandwich. It is equally delicious from both places. Last night, I went to Sassool and picked up 2 servings to go: I terribly disappointed in how they skimped on the chicken. For $7.99 + tax for each order, there was certainly more pita than chicken. It seemed like they mistakenly made enough chicken for one order and stretched it to two. At least I hope that's the case...Perhaps I'll just stick with Neomonde in Morrisville from now on."
2015-12-22,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Rise Biscuits & Donuts,"Finally had a chance to check out the newest of locations after Church. It is nestled in Sutton Square, which can have its moments with parking. We were lucky to get a spot right up front. My kids who love nuggets and donuts were super excited to finally be coming here. Both looked over the cabinet with delectable donuts and made their choices and ran off to the small kids area. One sprinkle and a chocolate frosted. I was tempted by the maple bacon bar but having not eaten I decided on a mushroom and rosemary gravy biscuit. My husband opted to have the brisket biscuit.No wait for the donuts but a bit of a wait for the biscuits. Well worth the wait as both of us devoured our biscuits. My gravy was flavorful and not too salty, which is what usually happens to biscuit gravy. My husband was nice enough to share a vote of his brisket and it was moist and delicious. Both kids proclaimed best donuts and devoured theirs without being asked twice. I was lucky to snag bites from both and they were soft and fresh.There is limited seating but they do have a few tables outdoors which will be nice in warmer weather. We will be back!"
2015-12-22,3.0,"Rolesville, NC",Big Al’s BBQ,The ribs are not that great and wings are not that great. I heard so much about how good the food is. But it was not that awesome. But if you like OK food with high price than its the place for you. I feel bad about leaving a bad review but it is what it is.
2015-12-22,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Wicked Taco Raleigh,"Last night was my second visit to Wicked Taco. I decided to hit the drive through with some friends since it was getting a bit late (we were still there about 45 minutes before closing) and we were starving. We were the only car in the drive through line and our food took longer than 15 minutes to get out to us while we were just sitting at the window... While I love the concept and the food sounds amazing on paper, it mostly gives you the ""meh..."" feeling. Nothing special really.. The tacos are pretty big though, and most people would be set with one. The combos are pretty expensive (why does it add $5 for chips & a drink??). Also, I ordered a combo with queso and they gave me guac instead. Didn't hurt my feelings too bad since I love guac also. Oh well.."
2015-12-22,4.0,"Portland, OR",The Pit,"A few things were really good, a few things weren't. Loved the ribs. Loved the brisket. Loved the hush puppies. Did not like the sweet potato fries; they had sugar added on top. Too sweet. Did not like the baked beans; seemed they weren't cooked enough. Did not like the candied yams; were sweeter than expected. I thought they'd have marshmallow on top, but they didn't. Fried chicken was a little over cooked."
2015-12-22,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Tijuana Flats,The food always taste very fresh and the staff is extremely catering and curteous. The taco Tuesday special is a really awesome deal as well.
2015-12-22,4.0,"Cary, NC",Bida Manda,"Had dinner there for the first time - make reservations!  The food and drinks are amazing-full of flavor.  My girls who live in town have identified this place as their ""go to"" for girls notes out.  I had the ribs - a big portion do I have some for lunch.  The spring rolls were a great start.  Unique drinks - the winter sangria ended up being ordered in a pitcher for all of us.  Look forward to going back soon."
2015-12-22,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Guasaca,Found this gem about a week ago and I've been three times. Food is great for everybody the portions are plentiful and filling. Its also pretty cheap! It is always packed though. Went and lunch and at dinner and it was hard to find seating.
2015-12-23,4.5,"Raleigh, NC",Mami Nora’s,"This chicken is to die for! Slow roasted with Peruvian spice, very savory with a little heat. Worth the short wait.  There are lots of interesting things on the menu to make Colonel Sanders jealous, including plantains, yum.  I tried both the yellow and green sauce, with green being my favorite, a blend of tomatillo (?), guacamole, pepper, lime, and cilantro. Wonderful.Come have some of Mama's cooking."
2015-12-23,3.5,"Holly Springs, NC",Raleigh Times Bar,"Atmosphere is great,  beer choices great.   A little annoying your need the app to pick,  but not a big deal.   App would be great if you could improve sort  by more categories like  IBUs and people's rankings.   Food is average and limited,  nothing special. So basically a great place to just hang and drink beer,  but that is what they were going for."
2015-12-23,3.5,"Yorktown, VA",Bonefish Grill,"We had dinner on 20 Dec 15 and the dining experience was superb.  Two of us had the Kobe Burger and I had the Sirlion Steak and Crab Cake entree.  The food was outstanding and very delicious.  But most important was our service.  The waitress, Ashley Denton, was very attentive, courteous, knowledgable and well-mannered.  She provided the best service that I have had in a very long time.  Please express our sincere thanks to Ashley for a job ""well done"". We will definitely be returning to your restaurant when we return to the Raleigh area in January."

2015-12-23,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Frank’s Pizza & Italian Restaurant,"I went there today for lunch needless to say I'm sitting at my desk praying for 5 o'clock to get here because I feel like I got to barf. I got a salad (lettuce, 2 cherry tomatoes and 3 olives with the pits still in them) I'm so glad I decided to cut the olive instead of biting right into it. Then the main course came and it was suppose to be lasagna and it was more like soup. The waitresses stood at the front counter talking I watched one customer get up from his table to ask for a drink refill. One waitress was actually talking about the time she got food poisoning(really). needles to say I will not be going back the Frankie's and that is a shame because back in the day the food was fabulous."
2015-12-23,4.0,"Wrightsville Beach, NC",Rye Bar & Southern Kitchen,Fantastic atmophere!!!! I normally do not eat at places attached to hotels but this caught my eye. It sits on ground level so you can watch everyone outside. Not to bad price wise. A must for your trip.

2015-12-23,5.0,"Apex, NC",Rise Biscuits & Donuts,"I'd like to give  4 1/2 stars but can't, so a 4 it is. Went to the Morrisville Rise today and will definitely be back to taste the other menu items. (in particular the monthly specials, so i have 2 weeks) for the steak biscuit and the mushroom & rosemary gravy biscuit. The donuts at lunch time didn't have as much variety due to the Christmas shoppers, otherwise i'd be telling you about the bacon maple donut, maybe next visit.Today My wife, daughter & I got the chicken biscuit, another daughter got the eggplant ""bacon"" biscuit. all VERY tasty. The chicken was well seasoned, not too greasy, the biscuit was way better than a chick fila or bojangles biscuit. All in All, i'd get it again.  The eggplant was a bit salty plain, (but I love salty) but wasn't bad with the biscuit.The shop is designed to order & go, but there are a few stools along the side of the shop if you decide to eat in as we did. For the big kid in you, or your younger ones, there is a chalk board. Elite Yelpers, join me in writting your names & year... i'll be back as i stated earlier, i like a biscuit in the morning."
2015-12-23,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mandolin,"A fancy restaurant with fancy food. I enjoyed my evening out at Mandolin. The service is spectacular; they really make you feel like a special guest. The food was great, however I did not like every dish I ate. For our first course we ordered Seared Scallops and Oysters Mandolin. The turnip soup with the seared scallop dish was divine and the scallops were plump and perfectly cooked. The Oyster Mandolin had delicious pork belly accompanied by fried oysters which unfortunately I could not taste due to being heavily coated, but all the components of the dish went well. For the second course, I ordered the Butternut Squash Latkes but I could not eat the dish so I traded with my boyfriend who seemed to have no complaints about it. I did not appreciate the red mole sauce. I thought it was too pasty and would have preferred my veggies only lightly seasoned. With the thick mole sauce I could not tell what the vegetables were. The Grilled NC Cobia then turned out to be my second course and it was delicious. The Cobia fish was cooked and seasoned well and the portion was large. The dish included forbidden rice which was fried in balls; they were amazing. This has been the best southern farm to table restaurant I have been to so far in Raleigh. Although I did not enjoy all the dishes, they have a nice selection and what they make for the most part, they make very well. Service is also superb. For a table for two, we were stuffed to the brim after two first courses and two second courses. I think this could be a place where you can skip the appetizer to lighten the bill since the second course portion is decent. However, some of the best flavors of the night came from the first course dishes."
2015-12-23,3.0,"Raleigh, NC",Flying Burrito,"I moved to the N. Raleigh area about a year ago and began to be a regular at the Flying Burrito.  I quickly became a regular as I would sometimes get home from work late and did not feel like cooking.  The place stays open pretty late on most nights.I quickly became a fan of the tacos (especially Taco Tuesday's) and the wonderful margaritas.  They have some very interesting margarita flavors like a mango margarita.  The fish tacos are my favorite.  I can honestly say that these are the best fish tacos I have tasted anywhere.What I like is that they do not use chopped up pieces of fish masquerading as a fish taco, but rather, a large generous portion of golden fried fish with a spicy sauce and slaw lightly dressed in a tortilla.  You have to see and taste this to believe it.The word must be getting around because in the year since I started coming to the Flying Burrito the crowds have grown exponentially, especially on Taco Tuesday's.  I have seen some reviewers complain that it is not authentic Mexican.  Well, if authentic Mexican is what you want, go find that restaurant, there are quite a few in the area.  If you want a great place with a courteous staff, good food, good drinks, and a great atmosphere then come to the Flying Burrito.  Did I mention the fish tacos?  See my picture.  Better yet...go get some...you will not regret it."
2015-12-23,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kamado Grille,"This place is fantastic!  The prices are really reasonable, the service is fantastic but the food is just simply amazing.  My husband and I split the reverse seared pork bomb entree.  It was only $18 and includes a side.  The pork was so delicious! So incredibly tender, juicy, smoky and luscious.  The sauce, that wonderful honey glaze BBQ sauce.. Just incredible.  The smoked Gouda mashed potatoes were sumptuous and perfect.  We added a side of grilled veggies that were so tasty.  Not overly charred and really buttery.  Our waiter James was extremely nice and helpful in explaining the menu and the ordering system.  He helped us order most of the menu, but let me tell you when my husband wanted another beer (which were all beautifully explained on the touchscreen) at the press of a button there was a waiter bringing it immediately.  Another thing I loved was that all of the wine was 7.50 a glass or 24.50 a bottle.  And they have great choices!  We will be back, probably once a week! I really think people got scared off by the lines when they first opened.  There are no lines.  I want it to be more crowded though because I need this place in my life!"
2015-12-23,4.0,"Durham, NC",Chuck’s,"The food here might be the best in the world, but the atmosphere is terrible. It is so loud we were literally screaming at each other. The waiter was yelling at us, and we were yelling back.  There weren't that many people inside, but the music was blasting and the walls and ceiling are bare hard surfaces, as is the floor and all the tables and chairs. So conversations echoed and carried, and even with just a few people inside, the din was overwhelming. When I go out to have dinner, I want to have conversations with my friends. I don't want to shout at the top of my lungs and have to constantly ask ""what? What did you say?!?""  It was extremely stressful to have that much sound pressure beating down on us, and we left after 10 minutes, without having even ordered or eaten a thing. Walking outside was a huge relief - even with the traffic and the buses roaring by it felt like silence in comparison. There is no way I'd ever eat here, it's just too loud."
2015-12-23,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Nashers Sandwich House,"After a couple of visits resulting in a couple of very delicious meals, I need to give Nashers some love. Especially since they are in one of those sort of ""cursed"" locations that has seen many a food place come and go.I've done the pick two both times. The first time I had the BBQ chicken salad and soup. This past time I had the buffalo philly cheesesteak and corn chowder. The cheesesteak was very good. Everything was nice and melted/blended together. It had some heat, but nothing over the top. The chowder was good and the added crab was a nice touch. Mrs. B got the tomato bisque. She said it was a little spicier than she was expecting, but good. We both thought the inclusion of a mini grilled cheese on the side was great.They have a seasonal option in addition to the regular menu items, and they now have a few beers on tap. The price point feels a bit higher compared to what you might get at other sandwich places, but the quality more than makes up for the difference."
2015-12-23,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gino’s Pizza,"This has to be the BEST $6.00 special ever!!!Pepperoni slice, side salad and large drink. My slice came out piping hot and was absolutely delicious.

I enjoyed everything about the meal, from the salad to the steak to the divine Creme brûlée. Bartender was exceptional and friendly. Liked the rustic feel, too, and the decorations around the holiday are festive, bright and over the top in a good way. A friend from Raleigh recommended I try it. So glad I did."
2015-12-23,4.0,"Huntington Beach, CA",Angus Barn,"The Angus Barn is truly an experience.  A group of us had dinner and the food and service was excellent.  Since it was during the Christmas Season, they really went all out with the decorations. They even had a tree with a person dressed as an elf coming out of the middle of it. Great photo ops.  We even received a tour that included the wine cellar, kitchen and the history of the Angus Barn which dates back 60 years.  I wouldn't normally mention the restrooms, but the women's restrooms looked like a stable.  Great experience and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great dining experience."

Was blown away, every aspect of our experience was fantastic!Our group ordered the brussel sprouts appetizer, shrimp tacos, shrimp polenta, and steak and potatoes. I had to sample everybody's because it looked so delicious. Loved both the taste and presentation of every platter! The serving size was perfect, and the price reasonable. The waitress was friendly and attentive, and the manager came out and chatted with us for quite a while too to make sure we enjoyed our experience.

2015-12-24,4.0,"Garner, NC",Oak City Meatball Shoppe,"The quality of the food was fantastic, and service was great as well. My 3 stars come from the menu and prices honestly. It's very hard to understand what your options are, specifically the sides. It's very unclear how big they are, price, what entrees come with what... it might be ridiculous to some of you reading this, but it could just be streamlined much more and I could spend time enjoying my meal instead of figuring out how to order and not spend $16 on a sandwich and side salad."

2015-12-24,4.0,"Wilson, NC",Glenwood Grill,"Very nice location.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The food is very good, not 5 star but very nice.  I had the lump crap which is very good for Raleigh, not Boston or south Florida level for seafood but still very nice. My wife had the rack of lamb and it was pretty tasty, it was a little tough but they gave decent portions.  Not ridiculous amounts of food, just about right.  The prices were definitely reasonable I thought.  We had drinks and the bill came to around 80 bucks.  I wish they were located in Wilson, they would rank 5 stars given the competition.  In Raleigh, I can't rate them on a curve so it is a strong four stars.  We will definitely be back, very comfortable and enjoyable atmosphere."
2015-12-25,4.5,"Raleigh, NC",Vinos Finos Tapas and Wine Bar,Best food in Lafayette  village. Shrimp is great and the Tuma on cracker deal is awesome.  Wine and service are great. I would recommend to anyone.

2015-12-25,4.5,"Zebulon, NC",Neomonde Bakery & Deli,"Always went to the grocery side in the past, which is wonderful.  This time decided to dine in...  Service was horrible, half the order was not included when we paid.  We didn't know until the cashier came over to our table and insisted we paid for food she forgot to include in our bill, didn't even apologize for her mistake.  Was terribly embassed by the way she treated us like criminals in front of a busy lunch crowd.  Even after we paid for the cashiers mistake,we still were missing food that we ordered orginally. Anyway, probably will not dine in again, but if you can get past the service the food is still great!"
2015-12-25,4.0,"Bothell, WA",The Players Retreat,"Probably the worst food I have ever had in a sports bar and I have had some pretty nasty over the years in bars.  This is not a great introduction to North Carolinan cuisine, but I will not judge the entire area on one bad meal.      Microwaved burgers?  That's how it tasted to me, rubbery and tough, bleh...  No thanks."
2015-12-25,4.5,"Durham, NC",El Pollo Rico Restaurant,"So I got hooked on pupusas when my former coworker introduced me to them about a year ago. Today was the first time I stopped in to place an order myself. I was hoping for yuka and pupusas but the yuka went up in price again, plus, I was not going to be able to eat the whole container of it myself so I decided on just the pupusas. It was a short wait while they prepared my order to go. The pupusas did not disappoint!!! Keep up the good work and amazing food!"
2015-12-25,3.5,"Knightdale, NC",Chopstix Gourmet and Sushi Bar,"We've been here twice...Jin Yuan's was so good in this location previously, we were hoping this new restaurant could be their replacement. Both times, food took over an hour to come out, orders were incorrect, and sushi was borderline inedible and improperly made. Drinks go unfilled for long stretches, and service is lacking at best. Raleigh is a great city for food, and there are better options for Chinese food, and sushi, on almost every corner. Pass on this one."
2015-12-25,3.5,"Raleigh, NC",Sardi’s Den,"As much as I try to write a positive review, there's little positivity I can say about this place. Yes, I read some of the other negative reviews about this place, but they were on par. Here are the facts about my recent experience. Positive: we walked in and got a table with no wait. Negative: we were not greeted for 10 minutes. We had to flag down another server to get noticed. We ordered an entree salad and a wrap sandwich with baked potato side. Also asked for no cheese and no tomatoes on the wrap sandwich. Negative: we waited 40 minutes for our entree salad and wrap sandwich. When it finally came to the table the wrap sandwich included the tomatoes and cheese. No baked potato because they conveniently ran out. We received no manager table visit for our long wait time nor for the incorrect order.It's an okay atmosphere, but the long wait times for simple items is truly not acceptable. The waitress apologized, but it would have been nice for her to get management involved. Poor training???"
2015-12-25,4.0,"Pittsboro, NC",Mandolin,This place is a complete gem!  I can't wait to go back.  The service was impeccable.  Absolutely spot on.  Very nice people.  The food is in a category all of it's own.  Wow!  Everything I had was fresh that day and cooked to perfection.  This is one of those places you will want to go out of your way to go back over and over.  Well done!
2015-12-25,5.0,"Wilson, NC",Firebirds Wood Fired Grill,"We met friends here for drinks and an appetizer (no full meal experience), we were going to have drinks at the Glenwood Grill where we ate but they do not open until 5:30 and we needed alcohol at 5:00.  We sat in the bar at a small table by the door during the Christmas season, so the experience was not going to be optimal regardless.  The only real negatives that I had for the place were that they were grossly understaffed and the pimento cheese appetizer was not very good.  They apparently try and make their own recipe using some type of Kraft shredded cheese so the texture was very hard and not conducive to dipping which is apparently why they gave us the greasy tortilla chips.  I would have much preferred a container of Ruth's brand pimento cheese spread with a box of saltine crackers.  Actually getting hungry for that now.  Anyway, might try it sometime for a full dinner experience when it is not a busy time.  I will never order the pimento appetizer again though.  Merry Christmas. I have pimento cheese to find now."

2015-12-25,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gonza Tacos y Tequila,"Not Hipster enough to be greeted.This place is beyond lame!  The ""hostess"" allowed me to stand in front of her for AT LEAST 2 minutes without looking up.  I went to the restroom, returned and only lasted 30 seconds before whispering, ""Excuse me.""   She waited a couple of seconds and blankly looked up at me.""We're closed, we open at 5:00.""  It was 4:57!!!No more of this trendy, inauthentic Latino fusion joint for me."
2015-12-25,5.0,"Saint Louis, MO",Jimmy V’s Osteria & Bar,"We dined there after a 2 hour wait for food after we placed our order on Christmas Day.  We were pleased that a restaurant was open on a holiday and would be willing to cut some slack on the food delay BUT we couldn't even get beverages.  Finally after about an hour they did give us some bread.  I had the pizza.  The kitchen must have run out of ingredients as there was almost nothing on the pizza-sauce, cheese, sausage etc.   The other entree was a filet for $32.  The meat was tender but completely tasteless and smothered in some type of sauce reminiscent of A1.  We decided to slice the steak and put on the pizza which made an edible combination.  I think this restaurant needs a Chef Ramsey makeover STAT!"
2015-12-25,5.0,"Park Ridge, NJ",Salt & Lime Cabo Grill,"Solid 4.5 ya got to love it one owner is cooking and the other sweeping and cleaningI had a great Burrito, full of flavor inside and out.

2015-12-26,4.0,"Atlanta, GA",Pho Far East,"I have been coming here for 10 years and the quality has always been excellent. Excellent Pho, plus a few dishes that are a little harder to find at other places, like banh uot cha lua. Vietnamese dad approved."
2015-12-26,4.5,"Wake Forest, NC",Mi Cancun,"I think it deserves 2 1/2 stars. This is El Rodeo without the numbers. The place was large, open, clean. Food was average to below average. I guess it really depends on your expectations. I liked my chicken taco and my husband enjoyed his beef taco. I was not impressed with my cheese enchilada and you could not tell his beef burrito and beef enchilada apart except one was slightly larger. Service was fine. Forgettable and common."
2015-12-26,3.5,"Bailey, NC",Chuy’s,"This place is unique. It has a great ambience of intentionally kitschy Mexican decor.  Every time we have been there service has been great--attentive, accurate, and they have lavished upon us piles of fresh chips, extra creamy jalapeño dip, and salsa. They even sent us home with our leftovers accompanied by an extra helping of chips, salsa, and jalapeño dip!The food is uniquely Tex-Mex, which offers a nice alternative to the pleasant but mundane offerings provided by most Mexican restaurants (e.g., Tapatio, San Jose, etc.).  I found the Chicka-Chicka Boom-Boom enchiladas to be very nice, the taco and enchilada combo was enjoyed by my wife, and my brother in law was quite happy with his burrito.The are several different sauces to select from, which you can choose to have on your entree if you don't care for the default one.  The star of the meal for us is always the Queso Compuesto dip with limitless chips.  Oh! And I almost forgot the Margaritas!  I could almost live on the queso, chips, and margaritas. (Maybe not for very long, but what a way to go!)"
2015-12-26,4.0,"Cary, NC",Plates Neighborhood Kitchen,This place gets 5 star just for being open on Christmas Day! We were also excited to give them a second chance after a not so great experience the first time. We had all small plates which were delicious. The ham biscuits were amazing as well as the quiche. Great service from Kendall. And everyone was in such a great Christmas spirit! Oh and let's not forget the pecan pie. .... AMAZING! Look forward too seeing you next Christmas!
2015-12-26,5.0,"Zebulon, NC",Casa San Carlo Italian Restaurant,Consistently good.  My family and I are regulars here.  If we want to be certain we are getting a good meal this is where we go.  The buffet is wonderful.
2015-12-26,5.0,"Charleston, SC",Taverna Agora,Great food and friendly service. The Greek tasting platter is a must. Reasonable prices.
2015-12-26,4.0,"Greensboro, NC",Gonza Tacos Y Tequila,"After being disappointed in the N Raleigh location a couple of times, I went to the new Hillsborough St location tonight. Was excited to have heard a positive review, and this location is less than 2 miles from my house. Food:  average.  A minimalist menu, nothing outstanding. Atmosphere:  Good.  Quite attractive, open air. Good stuff. Margaritas:  excellentStated closing time:  10pm.  With most restaurants, this is when they discontinue seating.  At 9:40, the cleanup started, the music stopped mid-bite, mid-margarita.  With a small amount of effort, they could have sold twice the drinks. I pay a little more for superior quality and/or service.  I don't feel like our party got either."
2015-12-26,1.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gino’s Pizza,I like Gino's a lot.  Definitely the best pizza on this side of town.  Often I enter with the intention of trying something else but the pizza is so good I always leave with one.  The folks are nice and seem like they enjoy what they do.  It shows in the food.
2015-12-26,5.0,"Waikiki, Honolulu, HI",Jose and Sons,"Definitely some interesting flavors. The fish tacos were really good, the Gouda mac was awesome. The homemade salsa is wonderful."

2015-12-26,4.0,"San Francisco, CA",Babylon Restaurant,"a wonderful place to dine. fresh, well sourced ingredients accentuate the euro-north african fusion menu items. a fine selection of wines, beer, and cocktails are available to refresh your palate between bites. as minor critiques; the lamb and salmon were a little overcooked and the almond rolls were wrapped in stale phyllo dough. their chicken and squashes are tender and succulent. our seared tuna and chicken bastilla are not to be missed."
2015-12-26,5.0,"Apex, NC",The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar,I had a chance to go back to Cowfish and enjoy another dinner.  I ended up sitting at the bar for dinner (not for a lack of being asked otherwise) and enjoyed a great meal with perfect service.  I will definitely be back and I will happily recommend them to my friends (and especially out of town guests) for a unique and delicious place to try while in Raleigh.
2015-12-27,4.0,"Durham, NC",Coquette Brasserie,"It's all about that quiche, 'bout that quiche, 'bout that quiche, oh baby! Imagine this: Sunday brunch with your favorite couple {shout out to Jon G. & Katherine L. *newly engaged!*}, reservations made via OpenTable, you walk into the high ceilings, naturally lit restaurant and are greeted and shown to your table. It's exactly what you'd imagine walking into a French bistro should be like and conveniently located at North Hills Mall (the most unique mall in the Triangle, with decent eating spots!) The menu is quite large (literally, it's like reading a huge cardboard sized newspaper); filled with entrees, apps, salads and soups. I highly recommend the French onion soup as a starter if you're extra hungry {each table is also served bread to start}. We ordered the Croque Madame and the Spinach Quiche (both served with a simple mixed greens salad with vinaigrette) as entrees, and while the croque madame was good, the quiche outshone it by far! They've must fold something into those eggs, creme fraiche possibly, because it is by far the fluffiest, tastiest quiche I've enjoyed, and that's even with it being slightly cold in the center, unfortunate that they didn't get the temperature right. Regardless, I would definitely return for brunch, I loved the atmosphere, the service was excellent, and I don't think it will take long to crave that quiche again!"
2015-12-27,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Sitti,Really didn't care for my meal at all. I ordered the kofta kabob wrap. The meat patty was cold by the time it came to the table and it was pretty small too. The sandwich was all bread and hummus. Very disappointing.
2015-12-27,3.5,"Raleigh, NC",Backyard Bistro,If you love wasabi order the Chef Keith's Cubano signature sandwich because that is all you'll taste. They say it has spicy mustard and for me a condiment compliments a dish but their spicy mustard ruled this one tasting only wasabi. We may go back because of the location to PNC if we forget to eat first but at the same time once you've gone that far if it doesn't work out you're left to arena food so maybe not worth the risk. PS that was a $12 sandwich. I give it 5 Yucks! I would have preferred a hotdog from the arena to that!

2015-12-27,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Casa San Carlo Italian Restaurant,"Not about ""All You Can Eat"" -- it's ""All You'll Want to Enjoy""My wife and I have followed Chef Carlo for close to a decade, since Casalinga Ristorante Italiano. Today, dinners at San Carlo continue to be spectacular -- food, presentations, wine choices and staff. But let's talk about here about the buffet. Casa San Carlo is NOT Golden Corral. That chain outfit is personified by a line in Huey Lewis's ""Bad is Bad,"" that says ""Across the street/A neon sign/All you can eat for a Dollar ninety nine/...But-a one dollar's worth/Was all that I could stand"". It's also NOT an Italian version of the myriad ""Asian"" buffet's that come and go around town.At Casa San Carlo's buffet, you can certainly fill up. But it's not about all you can eat; it's about all you'll want to enjoy.  It's the variety each visit that mixes in favorite regular Italian dishes with new ones. It's the options and wonderful choices.  You're wasting your taste buds' delight if you shovel here. Consistently over the years we've followed Carlo, like his dinners, you'll want to taste and enjoy every bite. This is what separates Casa San Carlo from other buffets. It's about the truly great cuisine and experience, not an Exxon station.We've never left hungry -- nor have any of the many family, friends and business associates I've brought to Casa San Carlos. And we've never left disappointed.Here are just some of the aspects I've tallied up where they shine:+ Pizza and stromboli crust+ Perfectly al dente  pasta+ No-compromise ingredients (no wanna-be cheese or meats)+ Vegetable dishes you'll wish your Mom could have made+ Complex flavors you won't find in typical buffets""+ Quality in everything -- we've never been disappointed in a dish+ Incredibly fair pricing, particularly considering that it's great food, not a fried mess+ Fresh salads and foods never scream ""day old""+ Parking in this low-key shopping area is easy (park closer to Casa San Carlo's rather than the Harris Teeter)+ Comfort is high -- in food, in the staff, in the seating, in the lighting and in the decor. It's impossible to feel stressed when you're there.We're never bored with all they have to offer. And Carlo, who is wonderfully fanatical about ensuring consistency in each dish ever day, takes time to make you feel welcome and like family. The tables and restrooms are always clean, and I'm amazed how often other patrons seem to be part of the shared experience -- though we enjoy a fun and romantic lunches there that seem like it's just my wife and I. There you go. Think of Carlo's as a place of variety and Italian food delights. It's not a slop-and-plop. The value, experience, and taste will surprise you time and again. It's why we've followed Carlo for so many years. Viva Casa San Carlo, and buon appetito!"
2015-12-27,4.0,"Holly Springs, NC",Centro,"Not sure what the hype was all about. I should have gone to one of the other 6 places I was thinking about trying for the first time. My steak tacos were delicious, as was the rice and beans. but for $11? not again. My friend had a chicken taco and the chicken was pre-cooked and rolled in corn meal like something I would get from Mellow Mushroom. I expected fresh made to order mexican cuisine. I was not thrilled. Would not go back, but would recommend the enchiladas, the mole sauce is legit,"
2015-12-27,4.0,"Brighton, MA",Lilly’s Pizza,"I moved from Raleigh to Boston 8 years ago, and still make it a point to stop by Lilly's each time I visit family in the area. Lilly's is hands down the best pizza I've ever had, and that is saying something when you live in the Northeast. The crust is amazing, and the toppings are fresh and delicious. The staff and decor are delightfully hip. My go-to is Dante's Inferno, but there isn't a bad choice on the menu."
2015-12-27,4.0,"Cary, NC",Chuck’s,"A gourmet burger and fries for $10.50 with choice of two sauces for the fries is a good deal in my book.  There are several burgers to pick from and the option to make it a 'double' if you decide you are 'hungry'  They have a number of signature sauces which the garlic aioli is my fav while my husband like the comeback sauce).  The server was very friends, prompt, an knowledgeable of the menu and options that we asked about."
2015-12-27,3.5,"Cary, NC",Tupelo Honey Cafe Raleigh,"Clean.comfortable atmosphere, fresh, flavorful foods and five-star service [Chryssha was our server and she is truly professional, efficient and, absolutely delightful!] We reserved a table (party of six ) to celebrate my son's 21st birthday and everything exceeded our expectations."
2015-12-27,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Mo-Te Vietnamese Restaurant,The boba was not well blended and was way too sweet. They also took a very long time giving us our order. I have definitely tried better.
2015-12-27,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Mecca Restaurant,"I really like Mecca, especially the idea of it being Raleigh's oldest restaurant and the charm that comes from keeping so much of the original place. The service is courteous and sincere.  They care about their customers.  The food is good, not an outstanding taste experience, but good food and recipes that have endured.  I enjoy going to Mecca and definitely recommend it."
2015-12-27,5.0,"Rolesville, NC",Irregardless Cafe & Catering,The place was pretty dark and had a musty smell. Food was not all that as far as dessert
2015-12-27,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Station,Ryan is a great server! Very attentive and friendly! They also have good drink specials everyday of the week.
2015-12-27,4.0,"Manhattan, NY",Coquette Brasserie,"I have been going there for years. The food used to be good, but since last night's experience, I am very disappointed.The duck confit leg was dry and somehow burnt on the outside. The boeuf bourguignon was just a pasta dish with tiny bits of beef not cooked the right way (tasteless). The crêpe appetizer was in fact a pancake overpowered by garlic.The cassoulet lacked tenderness and taste. Every single dish was very salty... The 2 stars are just for the decor and staff."
2015-12-27,5.0,"Durham, NC",Lilly’s Pizza,"My last Lilly's experience was below average.  Ever since being introduced, The Sir Walter Raleigh has been a favorite of mine.  The reason for 3 stars here is because I picked up a pizza to-go and got home to find out they didn't slice my pizza for me.  Lilly's still has some of the best pizza around Raleigh, but hope next time I order a pizza it will be sliced for me, haha."
2015-12-27,3.0,"Cary, NC",Angus Barn,"Yes,  it can be a bit overrated but we've been here several times now and I'm never disappointed.  It's a wonderful, unusual place to bring out of town guests especially during the holidays when it's all decked out. There was even a live elf inside the large Christmas tree this year and other elves to take our photos next to it.  There were five of us and we shared a few dishes (which they split up for us) making the total $220 for three meals,  four dessert and a few drinks.  The steaks were cooked perfectly tho the accompanying sauces were slightly off - the garlic sauce we asked to be served on the side wasn't warm and I didn't have blue cheese on mine.  Otherwise everything was delicious and the service was perfect. We had delicious gingerbread cookies offered to us as well which was fun. We did the complimentary tour since we had a guest which was great and informative.  Every one we passed during the tour from the dishwashers to the cooks smiled and welcomed us.  Yes,  we will try other places that are recommended but we will come back here as well."
2015-12-27,2.0,"Durham, NC",Jose and Sons,"I've eaten at Jose and Sons twice now and both times I left feeling more than satisfied.  I've had the same waiter both times as well, and I wish I remembered his name because he was a great server all around.The Enchiladas Del Mar have been my go-to, something about them is seriously addicting.  The day after I eat here all I crave is this meal all over again.  I've also had the guac, pimento cheese plantains, and have tried a taste of someone else's crispy pork belly waffle.  All were delicious and of great variety.  Next time I'd like to try something new, but it's going to be so hard to turn down those enchiladas.  They also have several craft cocktails, and I approve of the few I've had so far.As far as the prices go, Jose and Sons is on the higher end for Mexican food, but it's not your typical TexMex joint.  I like to describe it as contemporary Mexican with a Southern twist. In my opinion it's well worth the price you pay.I look forward to getting back here in the near future!"

2015-12-27,5.0,"Chapel Hill, NC",Angus Barn,"It over all was a good experience. Walked in and it's decorated very well and the ambience was great. We were sat down and they for the most part got our drink orders and then food orders relatively quick. I got the French onion soup, filet mignon with garlic mashed potatoes. The steak was cooked a little more well done (even after ordering it medium rare) but still delicious. All in all the food was nothing to write about (pun intended). The decor of the place was incredible."
2015-12-27,2.0,"Centreville, VA",Angus Barn,"Angus Barn is a very special place for me and my husbands family. They have been going as a family tradition for many years and we always go during Christmas to enjoy being together with good food and warm Christmas decorations. This year was no different.However this year's experience was not what we were used to. This year our server was having an especially difficult time. We usually go with around a party of 8 people. There were a number of errors with our order. First, there were no crackers and cheese on the table when we were sat and had to request them after we ordered. Second, they forgot my husband's appetizer so he did to get it until his entree came out. They didn't inform us that trout wasn't available until our entire order was ready and our uncle had to wait until his dish was prepared. They seemed unorganized and because of this all of our food was not hot when it can out. Finally, they forgot my mother-in-law's dessert and it wasn't even served to her the way she requested it. I completely understand that serving large parties are a challenge. At the same time there was definitely a lack of attention to simple things during our entire meal. I know how detailed and formal our dining experience usually is. It made you feel special. However, this see ice experience made me feel like we were just at your usual casual dining establishment except charged considerably more.I'm giving it 3 stars because I know this was most likely due to this particular server and not the establishment."
2015-12-27,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Guasaca,"Soo good!! The arepas are amazing and so are the salads. My favorite protein selection is the tilapia.

2015-12-28,3.5,"Raleigh, NC",Another Broken Egg Cafe,Terrible service.  We waited 5 minutes to even see a hostess. Then sat and waited 10 for seeing a bored acting waitress.  Ran out of coffee. Asked a random guy. Still waiting on our food but over it after another 20 minutes. No sign of waitress no sign of food. Finally got it. 30 minutes from coming in. Dry omelette overcooked. For 40 dollars. Oh and the bird feeder outside is full of water and green with mold. Yum.
2015-12-28,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Station,"The new waitress they have outside is awesome-she makes up for all the crap service I've had in the past.  Do have to say that there are still some pretty awful servers working here though.  Overall much better, however.  And it still has a great patio!"
2015-12-28,4.0,"Dallas, TX",Buku,Me and my boyfriend dropped in one Sunday night for a few drinks and light dinner. Easy street parking right outside. We sat at the bar and had the crunchy salmon and buku rolls. They were delicious. The bartender was the perfect mix of attentive without hovering. Appropriately/moderately priced for the atmosphere and menu. Great experience. Would recommend this place to friends and family if they're ever visiting Raleigh.
2015-12-28,4.5,"Willow Spring, NC",Guasaca,"This place is awesome. Guasawesome, if you will (yes, I went there). All of the fillings are fresh, well prepared, and perfectly seasoned, but the real magic lies with the arepas. If I could shove any sandwich fixings in between one of these things, I probably would. Crispy on the outside, richly soft on the inside, with a flavor reminiscent of a tortilla chip, the arepa is the perfect vessel to hold all of its delicious insides. I always order the steak arepa with black beans and cheese, and it is consistently fantastic. My girlfriend also opts for steak, minus the beans, plus pico de gallo, onions, and Guasaca and cilantro sauces. We have been to Guasaca a handful of times and always end up remarking to each other just how good the food really is. The decor is bright and cheery, and the restaurant itself is impressively clean.The only drawback is the fact that our orders have gotten messed up with pretty alarming frequency. This is likely due to the fact that the music is loud and the employees speak fairly quietly, leading to miscommunications. They are always happy to rectify the mistakes quickly though, so in my book, no harm no foul."
2015-12-28,4.0,"Wake Forest, NC",Irregardless Cafe & Catering,This place is great. Service is friendly and professional. Food is excellent. Good restaurant to take out-of-towners to.
2015-12-28,4.5,"Durham, NC",Sassool,So I love Sassool however they are starting to go downhill. It started with the service hiring young kids and not properly training them. The lady at the register didn't know a baklava came with the lunchbox combo and was about to double charge me for it. Also didn't even know which was the orange baklava and had to ask another employee. Also had no clue what to punch in on the screen talking herself through it. On a different note I love their food it is really delicious however it is also beginning to slack on quantity of food. Just look at my chicken shawarma photos and you will see a pita hardly filled with chicken. It was pitiful. It used to be overflowing or at least enough to where there weren't any gaps in the pita. I'm not sure if their attention has been placed on the new store in Cary but the Strickland road is falling behind!
2015-12-28,4.0,"Tarpon Springs, FL",b.good,"I was traveling through Raleigh and seeking a local place to stop for a healthy lunch. B. good was easy to find, had plenty of delicious veggie options, and a clean, casual atmosphere. The kale and quinoa bowls were just what I was looking for. (A few days on the road meant my buns couldn't handle anymore buns!). I'm not a strict vegan, but I try to eat primarily plant-based. Although none of the bowls were truly vegan (they all had either egg, dairy, or meat), easy substitutions could be made, and they even had an option to add tofu! The curry avocado bowl was hearty and filling.All in all, quick service and yummy inexpensive health food from local farm sources! Doesn't get much better than that.Beware though: parking is a little tricky to come by....look for it on the street before you end up looping back up to the highway like I did!"
2015-12-28,4.5,"Marmora, NJ",Ajisai Japanese Fusion,So far so good. I am new to the area and a sushi lover. I am trying them all. So far this is my favorite. Great atmosphere even better service. I have to say this may be the best service I have ever experienced at a sushi rest. Manager is on top of things. It is real sushi unlike the others I have tried in Raleigh. Tuna dumplings are awesome. Many different offerings. Prices are average. Cheaper than downtown's sub par offerings. Outside seating was very nice in a quieter area of Cameron. They had the heaters lit the night we visited. Cannot wait to go back
2015-12-28,4.0,"San Jose, CA",Driftwood Southern Kitchen,"Excellent food and service! I have celiac disease and must eat gluten free, so when I asked my waitress if things could be made gluten free she did not hesitate and suggested alterations to what I wanted. My food was wonderful.  Thank you for helping me stay healthy!My single complaint is that the metal chairs are not comfortable. Look cool, but they dug into my hips."
2015-12-28,4.0,"Columbia, MD",Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar - Seaboard,"Just finished our meal. Wish we lived locally. This is very good quality.  You can build your own burger or choose from selection. We were completely satisfied. Fresh fruit as side was pleasant surprise. House made chips a little salty but would get again. Tater tots huge portion. Truffle fries hit with good seasoning. The burgers cooked perfectly to order. My daughter keeps saying that burger was the bomb. Definitely come here!  Oh, and great service."
2015-12-28,5.0,"Elizabeth City, NC",Kamado Grille,Who wasn't tired of cooking after the Christmas holidays. Took the family here for a nice break away from the house. The atmosphere is super. The service is outstanding as well. We all had the steak which was good but no better than some other steak places. The cheese grits were awesome but a little spicy for grits in the south. I would order them again. Overall a nice family dining experience. I love the way you can order and pay from your table with a tablet they furnish.
2015-12-28,4.0,"Morrisville, NC",The Morning Times,"Cool spot for breakfast and brunch. We tried the chicken&waffles and biscuit-mushroom gravy. This is one restaurant in downtown that offers vegetarian gravy for biscuits. Both of them were very fresh, but the portions could have been slightly bigger."
2015-12-28,2.0,"Oakland, CA",Beasley’s Chicken & Honey,"If you are looking for a place that is open late, has great drinks and amazing food in downtown Raleigh, look no further than Beasley's. I stumbled upon this place looking for something local to North Carolina several months ago and was not disappointed on my first visit. It's a nice open seating venue, with the menus for both food and drinks written up on the wall. The menu is very simple, but very popular southern dishes prepared with amazing quality. For dinner, look no further than the Chicken and Waffles. You can find this anywhere, but their twist of adding just the right amount of honey to balance the maple syrup makes all the difference. The chicken is nice and moist and the waffle tastes great. The sides are all pretty tasty, but you might be just fine with this dish. If you happen to be there for brunch on the weekend, be sure to order the churros. The order comes with a generous serving of these amazingly fluffy sweets! I couldn't make them any better myself, and maybe adding a caramel or chocolate sauce would be nice but not even necessary. I also had the huevo ranchero plate, based on a red-bean vs the traditional pinto. Service is incredible and everyone is extremely friendly. I showed up 30 minutes before their closing time on my first visit and they welcomed me in and didn't rush me in any way. Amazing service, great good, wonderful atmosphere. Be sure to check them out."
2015-12-28,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Standard Foods,"After eagerly awaiting the opening of this restaurant, I wasn't surprised when there was a 1.5 hour wait when we showed up without a reservation on a Wednesday night.  But, after a trip around the corner for some pre-dinner drinks to kill some time, I got a text letting me know a table was ready for us.  The menu is small, and from what I tasted, everything is a win.  Cocktails are on point.  Service gets 5 stars too.  Really looking forward to making it back, but next time, we'll be sure to make a reservation first."
2015-12-28,5.0,"Charlotte, NC",Randy’s Pizza,Very very good NY style pizza.   Sauce has good flavor and the toppings are great.  Crust was perfect.
2015-12-28,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Death & Taxes,"Dude, I don't know what the hell all these people are complaining about.  This restaurant is amazing!  Ashley Christenson hit it out of the park yet again.  Delicious cocktails, expertly trained staff, and DELICIOUS food.  Is it a little pricey?  Sure-it's a high end restaurant.  However, I find it to be comparable in price to Poole's Diner.  It's a great place for a date night or special occasion.  It fits right in with her other restaurants and is an excellent addition to DTR.  Highly recommended!"
2015-12-28,5.0,"Washington, DC",Bida Manda,"What more is there to say that hasn't already been said by 578 other people? Came here for the first time tonight after making a reservation with open table. I HIGHLY recommend making a reservation in advance because I went on a Monday night and as I was coming in I could Hear the hostesses telling people walking in that the wait would be 40 minutes or more. On a MONDAY NIGHT! My friend and I had the most lovely waitress. I wish I had caught her name because I would give her a shout out. She was super friendly and attentive. It's people like these that are gold to restaurants, making the whole experience that much better. We ordered the lettuce wraps, crispy pork soup, and pad Thai. The pad Thai was just ok, nothing extraordinary that you can't get anywhere else. The wraps and the soup however were really rich and flavorful.  I recommend trying these two dishes! Overall, great food, great atmosphere. Will be back!"
2015-12-28,5.0,"Quail Hollow, Charlotte, NC",Nashers Sandwich House,"The food here is really good, I had their signature fried chicken sandwich and fries. You may want to look at their menu online before you get in the door. Right when you walk in, the front counter is where you place your order. There is someone standing there and the menu boards above. I got there early so I could stand there debating my choice without jacking up the line. There are a lot of options that look great but I decided on the fried chicken. Great sandwich and it's plenty for one person. My only drawback would be that the tables needed to be wiped off and cleaned. I tried several tables but they all were dirty at 11:30am which was not even rush hour."
2015-12-28,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar - Seaboard,"It's not the best burger in town, but I'd definitely put it as one of the top 5.  I've started getting the pittsburger every time I go, and I'm never disappointed.  Pretty good beer selection and cute outdoor seating area.  All that and within walking distance from the house make it a winner."
2015-12-28,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gonza Tacos y Tequila,"The food here is good - I really enjoy it. However, on my last visit, my lunch companion and I were told by a waiter, who also took our drinks and remaining chips away from us, that we had to leave because we'd been there too long. We got kicked out! We'd been there less than an hour and there were only two other tables in the whole restaurant that had people at them, so we weren't taking up space someone else wanted. It was also only 1pm, so they weren't about to close for the afternoon. Seriously, Gonza? I am a tolerant person and I am willing to go to restaraunts where I don't love the service if I love the food, but that was unnecessary and unbelievably rude. I don't care how much I like your food. That was a low thing to do to a customer and I will not be coming back."

2015-12-28,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Yard House,"Ventured out of our nearby apartment at North Hills to visit for lunch. The atmosphere was dark, lounge'y', and lots of flashing tvs, not ideal for my 12 year old but I can see this might be a good date night spot for me and hubby one day.The menu was long, almost as long as the beer list. Lots on tap, husband went for the local Big Boss (Blanco Diablo in the winter??). For our app I wanted chips and guac but my family hates guac (I know, it's a constant source of arguments for us). So, I asked about chips and salsa and they said they only have pico which they brought us, and it was incredibly disappointing. Heavy HEAVY on the cilantro and it had a garlic taste, ugh. Chips were served cold. Strike 1.12 year old had pizza, which we all shared, and it was also disappointing. It tasted frozen, not quite heated all the way. I had cup of tortilla soup, which as actually pretty good - cheesy style, not broth, but still good. I had asana tacos for my entree, rice was awful, the tacos were kind of cold just not quite as impressive as they sounded.. Husband had bbq chicken salad (tip: order half, it's plenty big!!). He said it was great and I wished I had ordered it!All the stars are for the service, great waiter! We will likely be back, more for drinks and apps and leave the little one at home."
2015-12-28,3.0,"Durham, NC",Aladdin’s Eatery,"So I met a friend in brier creek, as she was coming from Raleigh and I was driving from Durham and she is a big fan of Mediterranean food and spoke very highly of this place. I went back and forth about what I should order, and I settled on one of the specialty plates. I got the lamb with rice. I must say the food was good, I realllllyyyy liked the rice with the pine nuts and the touch of cinnamon was awesome. I wish that the portions were a little bit bigger, as I left still feeling a bit hungry. I probably would have ordered dessert if our server had actually ask/offered it. Over all the experience was pretty average."
2015-12-28,4.0,"Palo Alto, CA",Tazza Kitchen Cameron Village,I was visiting from San Francisco for a weekend. We picked this place based on Yelp reviews and man I was glad we ate here. The pizza was super delicious. The service and the atmosphere was wonderful as well. I'll go back when I visit Raleigh again.
2015-12-28,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Chuy’s,"New twist on seating... it's the customers fault when the wait staff does not show up... For your troubles you are told you have to wait 10 to 20 minutes for a table, in an EMPTY restaurant. Don't think we'll be back...."

2015-12-28,5.0,"Southern Pines, NC",Salt & Lime Cabo Grill,Food was decent. Nothing to rave about. Staff was great. Helpful and amusing. If you're expecting real Mexican food then this is not the place. It's more fusion Mexican. (Americanized Mexican food) missing the regular stalked and the flavor
2015-12-28,4.0,"Wake Forest, NC",Chuy’s,I had to REORDER my food twice because they got it wrong and it still was very bad although I must admit that the interior decor is amazing also there was a guy in the back that was out at 11:00 and we had to be with him EW. Not a good place for children for many reasons.
2015-12-28,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bida Manda,"Absolutely hands down my favorite restaurant in Raleigh.  It is beautiful.  Expertly crafted from the cocktails to the wine menu to the decor to the staff to the food to the music.  Plus, it's owned by some of the nicest people I've ever met.  Everything in here is perfection.  Seriously, this would be my last meal.  An absolute gem!  I cannot stress to you how amazing this place is.  See for yourself!  Eat here, you won't regret it."
2015-12-29,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Kamado Grille,We love this restaurant. They have a great variety of food and the service is top notch. They really do have something for everyone. My picky on 9 year old is already begging to go back.  My daughters school had a spirit night there and they went over and above to accommodate us.
2015-12-29,4.5,"Cary, NC",Bad Daddy’s Burger Bar - Seaboard,"I've waited a long time to come here and I was not disappointed. Service was on point (thanks to Andrew) and the food was phenomenal. A little pricey for burgers and tater tots, but if every experience is as good as this one, it might be worth a few visits a year."
2015-12-29,4.5,"Williamsburg, VA",Trophy Brewing Company,"The beer is awesome! The second time I was in here they explained that it was the first time they had all beers on tap from that specific location.  The beer is well quality however, I was a little disappointed to find the darkest beer served at that time (December) was a brown ale. This is just a personal pet peeve where I like to drink darker warm beers in winter. They also serve uniquely crafted pizza. Most loyal is my favorite and the new kid is pretty good. Don't be afraid to try new pizza, even if it sounds weird, it's good! The salads are awesome, we always share a small, is big enough for two! The service is straight forward."
2015-12-29,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",David’s Dumpling & Noodle Bar,It was ok we had a hot and sour soup and an wonton soup.  Both were very spicy which is fine for the hot and soup - but it covered up all the other flavors that went with it - we also had the summer roll - it was lacking in favor and were tiny.  Over all its not someplace I would race back to.
2015-12-29,4.0,"Kittrell, NC",Firebirds Wood Fired Grill,"Great food, exceptional service!  We dined at lunchtime, table of 6.  Our server was very friendly and helpful, obviously experienced.  She was happy to split plates, accommodated all other requests and offered extras that we didn't think to ask for!  All our food arrived well prepared and at the same time.  Soft drink refills appeared without asking. We have dined at Firebirds before and always been happy, the general ambience of the restaurant is very relaxing, no loud music.  But this time seemed to be an exceptional experience, due to our server, who was so friendly and helpful."
2015-12-29,4.0,"Cary, NC",MachuPicchu Peruvian Cuisine,"I was very disappointment with the food and the service and the chef was as rude as could be. As a Peruvian, I am proud of my culture and food and went with my family to Machu Picchu hoping to eat good Peruvian food. You can't substitute some ingredients that are basic for the Peruvian flavors and this is what killed the food. The chicken tasted like rotten chicken and the excuse was that the spices had some kind of cheese. The ""Ocopa"" sauce was whatever except ""Ocopa"". The ceviche, OMG the worst I've ever tried in my entire life! I feel ashamed that non Peruvians are eating at this restaurant thinking that they are truly eating Peruvian food which they are not.  In conclusion, the restaurant is pricy, the food is bad and the chef/owner is a grumpy old lady that needs to make changes to her menu if she wants to call it Peruvian food or maybe change the name of the restaurant, plus hiring a couple of Spanish speaking servers wouldn't hurt, that way they could pronounce the names and know what they are serving!!"
2015-12-29,4.5,"Raleigh, NC",Bida Manda,"NEVER disappoints. I work minutes from Bida Manda and it has become my weekly lunch spot. I am a vegetarian and have ordered their Pad Thai, Basil Stir Fry, and Pumpkin Curry with added tofu. Everything was delicious but my favorite is the pumpkin curry. The flavor is amazing! I recommend asking for the spice tray and adding some chili oil for a nice kick. If you're getting an app - go for the crispy rice lettuce wraps..again, so good!Can't wait to see what they do next door ( I heard it was going to be a Dim Sum restaurant)"
2015-12-29,4.5,"Franklinton, NC",Wakefield Tavern,Started our night out at a sushi place down from Walmart. After deplorable service we canceled our order and decided to go here. We have only been here once before and it was pretty good. Tonight we were seated quickly in the pub area. My fiance ordered a patty melt with an egg on top which he loved. My food came out and I misread the Salisbury steak description. It came with a load of gravy on my potatoes. Which I personally do not like but that was my mistake. Our waitress (Rachel) asked us how our meal was and I told her it was my mistake that I do not like gravy on my potatoes and she promptly (even with me telling her it was my fault and it was fine) took my plate and brought it back with new potatoes with no gravy! She went above and beyond and was an amazing server. I loved my food but the awesome friendly service was for sure the reason we have now fallen in love with this place. Checked on us often enough that it was welcomed but not annoying like some places. We will be returning many times to bring our business here.
2015-12-29,3.5,"Raleigh, NC",Death & Taxes,"WOW!I met a friend after work for an early dinner here after hearing nothing but great things - it did not disappoint. Our waitress was great - so patient and explained everything on the menu in details as it is a bit confusing your first time. I started with the whole crab salad, which was amazing. Arugula, crab, and avocado  - what more can you ask for. We then shared the head of cauliflower (wow), the beets, the sunflower porridge, and the potatoes aligot (not to be missed).They have such an incredible take on these vegetables and the love and craftsmanship is visible in every dish. Can't wait to go again!"
2015-12-29,4.0,"Garner, NC",Anvil’s Cheesesteaks,"Not the best place to get a cheesesteak but it wasn't horrible either. It was bit pricy though. Hate that they served Utz chips, they are cheap and disgusting. It's not a bad place to stop by on a day trip, but I don't plan on returning."
2015-12-29,4.5,"Raleigh, NC",Gino’s Pizza,"My rating is based solely on my craving for a NY white pizza, calling, and being told they aren't delivering tonight. I'm sure it would've been delicious....but I have no way of getting it, despite their advertising free delivery. :(   The man on the phone was nice, though that doesn't help my hungry belly....."
2015-12-29,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Standard Foods,"Came here for lunch with some friends and a baby. The atmosphere was friendly and loud enough that the baby wasn't an issue. The staff was friendly and accommodating, even offered baby appropriate snacks, i.e. pecans. We ordered a few apps, deviled eggs, rabbit & dumplings, and cheeses, which were a bit small but delicious. For our entrees, half of us ordered the beef and the other half ordered the chicken. The dishes were all well executed. To top it off, their peppermint tea (hot and cold) were wonderful! Will definitely visit again."
2015-12-29,4.5,"Raleigh, NC",The Fiction Kitchen,"I'm a veterinarian. I haven't had meat in 30 years but OMG if you like vinegar based BBQ, wow the southern BBQ is amazingly tasty!  We got there at 450 pm on a Tuesday but only 3 tables left so get there early or expect a wait!  Wait service was also great. A new favorite!"
2015-12-29,4.5,"Raleigh, NC",Gonza Tacos y Tequila,"A corporate dinner brought me to Ganza. Although I'd heard great things about their margaritas, it wasn't an appropriate occasion for anything stronger than beer. The size of the party made it a little difficult to figure out who was a server and who wasn't, however the wait staff was friendly. Th buffet-style chicken and beef taco service was surprisingly fast and the food was absolutely fantastic! I'm looking forward to future visits; this could be the best Mexican restaurant in the triangle."
2015-12-29,3.5,"Wake Forest, NC",Lynnwood Grill & Brewing Concern,"Went here on a Monday night and they were packed. Monday night is wing night and lots of folks were taking advantage of that as were we. We were seated quickly and the service was pretty efficient.Wings were good. Definitely worth coming back for. The place is busy and noisy which you expect for a sports bar. Lots of TVs playing the Monday night football game. They make their own beer. I had a Hop over the Top which I really liked. Plenty of others to choose from as well. Overall, good experience. Will return. Good place to go after a movie at Raleigh Grande as it's  right across the street.  Next time maybe rooftop patio will be an option as it looks like a great spot!"
2015-12-29,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Morning Times,Fun coffee shop in the heart of DT Raleigh. When I first started going here ( a little of a year ago) I thought the staff was rude. It seemed like they weren't particularly friendly to new faces. Their lattes are pretty good - their pumpkin spice is better than Starbucks in my opinion - and reasonable priced.I tried their egg biscuit the other day and have to say I was surprised - it was delicious and cost less than $5 (which is cheap in downtown standards) The biscuit was light and fluffy and didn't sink in your stomach the way biscuits tend to do.Definitely check them out!
2015-12-29,4.5,"Raleigh, NC",Stanbury,"Another great restaurant for Raleigh.I made a reservation for 3, four days in advance and had no trouble getting a table (it as a week night). Parking was quite frustrating as there wasn't enough.Our waitress was extremely nice, casual, and extremely helpful.For starters, I ordered the grilled romaine - one of the best grilled salads I have ever had. I then went on to order the seared scallops - amazing! The other vegetarian at the table ( I often eat seafood) ordered the house made tagliatelle. Being a vegetarian, it's frustrating when the only vegetarian dish is a pasta - there are many more create things out there - anyhow the waitress insisted that it was delicious and should not be missed. She was right - it was amazing! so fresh and the cauliflower sauce that accompanied it was seriously like nothing I had ever had. Definitely lives up to all the hype - can't wait to go back!"

2015-12-29,4.0,"Durham, NC",Angus Barn,"The Angus Barn is, for me, more about the experience than the actual cuisine. My steak was somewhat flavorless and they served us a chilled (red) Bordeaux - and for having such an exhaustive and expensive wine list, one would think they would know not to chill a Bordeaux. The cheese spreads are fantastic, though, and the decor and atmosphere really is worth a visit."
2015-12-29,4.0,"Jonesboro, GA",Jose and Sons,Over priced. Weird menu. Brussels sprouts wrapped in bacon? Man I just want a fajita lol.
2015-12-29,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",The Remedy Diner,"Awesome place for anyone!I'm a vegetarian and went with two meat eaters ( who both ordered veg options) we all loved our meals. I had the Viet Nom Nom with Tofu, pickled cabbage, carrots, cucumber, cilantro, jalapeños, Sriracha aioli on a hoagie roll. So yummy! I love spice and this definitely had a kick to it! The pickled cabbage made the sandwich - can't wait to go back. It's so nice to see such interesting uses of tofuThe place isn't much to look at but the good is great!"
2015-12-29,4.0,"Winter Park, Orlando, FL",Cristo’s NY Style Pizza,"I consider myself a NY Pizza snob so it was with trepidation that I entered. I had business in the area, was hungry and needed to eat.  They offered the usual lunch special of 2 cheese slices and a soda for $5.50.  I opted for mushroom toppings, only .25 per slice.  Slices came out quickly, obviously reheated.  They were thin crust firm enough to hold in one hand. Couldn't fold it but didn't need to. Sauce was tasty, maybe a hint more oregano than I am used to.  Cheese was plentiful but not overly so and not dripping. One of the hallmarks of NY pizza that I am caring for less and less lately is oil dripping all over. Not a problem here.  Mushrooms appeared to be fresh sliced, not canned.  They also offer a special of 12"" personal pie with iced tea for the same price.  Maybe next time"
2015-12-29,3.5,"Bakersfield, CA",Flying Burrito,"I took my three granddaughters along with my wife here. It was Taco Tuesday so most of us had tacos.  I ordered three different ones along with a flavored margarita.  The flavors were good but the liquid in two of them leaked down my arm and dripped on my shirt front.  The waiter was unfriendly and seemed rushed as we had to go find our own napkins and utensils off the edge of the bar.  When I tried repeating the order from my granddaughter who has a soft voice, he looked at me with one eyebrow higher than the other and said in a short response , ""I heard."".  I could have dealt with the drips but not the drip."
2015-12-29,4.0,"St Paul, MN",Yard House,"Excellent atmosphere, fun and openess. Michael was a riot. The staff fun. Outdoor seating and as many tap beers,  or more, than the world of beers.

2015-12-29,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Driftwood Southern Kitchen,The angry tots were fiesty! Little bit of jalapeños to give 'em a kick. I had the salmon with farro salad which was also delish. It was a lot of good food. Will be back with my hubby. He's a picky foodie but I think he will approve!
2015-12-29,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gonza Tacos Y Tequila,"When it comes to Mexican I like it simple and down-home. Spartan interior with the latest juego de futbol playing on the TV and I'm happy. Gonza Tacos y Tequila is the exact OPPOSITE of that type of experience but you may still love it. Located on busy Hillsborough Street in the same building as the new Aloft Hotel, it's a beautiful space. Full of rich colors, earthy woods and lit stars above. They spent some money decorating the space. I'm grabbing lunch at the bar, some tacos, cilantro rice and queso. Everything is solid, tasty and well-prepared with slightly smaller portions. Service is fine at the bar and my meal gets unexpectedly comp'ed by their marketing person. Overall I like the space but it veers away from what I normally choose for my ethnic eats. So I'm giving Gonza Tacos my four stars because of the decor and ambiance. I think if you judged it by its food alone, it might not be as impressive. But it still works well if you've got a dinner date to impress or a fun party that needs some Mexican eats. And don't forget, there's a small private lot behind the building if you need a space."
2015-12-29,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Joule Coffee,"I used to love this place - relaxed, comfortable, and a great place to get some work done. I won't be going back. I consider myself a coffee person - what they serve is dirt with hot water. I get that the trend these days is organic but at least get organic with some flavor. It constantly tastes burnt and the milk/creamer sitting on the counter is anything but appetizing. The last time I was there the cashier double charged me for a crappy cup of coffee.Now for the food...I am a vegetarian and love that they sub the BLT's bacon for avocado. I don't love it when they put the avocado AND bacon on my sandwich after I specifically told them I was a vegetarian and only wanted avocado. The bacon was so greasy that even when I peeled it off my sandwich I couldn't even take a bite because of the stench of grease. Let is be known that this sandwich is $8.50...that is a lot for a SANDWICH. Don't even get me started on the ""side salad"" with an added up-charge. Seriously disappointed considering I work so close to Joule. There are MUCH better places for coffee ad lunch in DT Raleigh."
2015-12-29,5.0,"San Antonio, TX",Yard House,"We were there visiting family.  Two drinks had to be sent back due to be bad....but, the manager came to table twice, comped all appetizers and drinks for the 8-top table.  All in all, was good!"
2015-12-29,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Wicked Taco Raleigh,"For a five dollar meal, you can't expect a lot . Most places under $5 would offer greasy highly unhealthy junk. I was pleasantly surprised this place was quite the exception. I got a fish taco, which was a decent size, but wouldn't fill me up just with that. But it came with nachos and a cheesy sauce, which I ignored and instead got some fresh salsa from their salsa bar. I found that the coolest thing there- a wide variety of salsas to choose from, and they were really spicy and tasty. My favorite was the mango habanero and Chipotle cranberry.The place has a nice open air feel to it, and reminds me of Chipotle in a lot of ways. The woman who took my order was very grumpy, but others were nice and friendly. With the whole kid like charm to the place, it gives a nice ambience."
2015-12-29,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Flying Saucer Draught Emporium,"Never experienced such an awful restaurant experience. First time I've ever asked for a check early, and it's the first time I've left a $0 tip. Their manager came over at the end, and I was relieved to hopefully get things resolved. Sadly, he was incompetent at handling customers as well. Will never go back."
2015-12-29,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Gonza Tacos y Tequila,"Anytime I have a guest coming in from out of town, I bring them to Gonza's and they're never disappointed. In fact, I've had a couple friends ask that I take them back once they're back in town. Here are the top 3 reasons why I think Tacos y Tequila is a notch above the majority of other restaurants in Raleigh:#1: Tacos While their menu is relatively small and stays the same - outside of a few specials - the food is fantastic. You really can't go wrong with any of their styles of tacos. I've tried them all and would rank the Carne and Carnitas tacos towards the top.#2: MargaritasThe margaritas are always on point. They have a wide range of tequilas, so you can always mix things up. I especially remember a specialty mango margarita they served with a spicy chipotle rimming. THAT was amazing.#3: Salsa and chipsIMO Gonza's salsa is better than any other Mexcian restaurant's. Period. It's super fresh and has a lot of flavor. Nothing revolutionary about the chips or queso, but I recommend spending a little extra on the guac. Other perks:-Unique atmosphere-Covered outdoor seating-Dog friendly-Reasonably priced-Good place for a birthday. They bring you a free shot of tequila.Downsides:-Tends to be crowded. That's a testament to the restaurants popularity, but it's always a struggle to get a table around 7pm.-Not a lot of options on the menu"
2015-12-29,5.0,"Greensboro, NC",Aladdin’s Eatery,Food took forever to get to the table. The rice was dry and the portion of lamb to the rice on the plate was very low. The lamb was chewy and burnt. The beef kabob was delicious. Prices were too much for the amount of food but it is in brier creek. I'd recommend it but only if you're really craving some Lebanese food.
2015-12-29,2.0,"Philadelphia, PA",The Pit,"Came here for a family member's birthday.  We were a group of four adults and five children.  Service was very good and we were seated quickly on a Monday evening at 6.The biscuits and hush puppies that came out pre-meal were light and fluffy.  The warmed whipped honey butter was a nice addition.  The adult's mixed drinks of apple pie moonshine cider, Cosmopolitan, and Sangria hit the spot.  My appetizer dry-rubbed chicken wings were awesome and shared among the table.  My main meal of chopped pork and fried chicken was good.  The chicken had too much breading on it and slightly overdone.  The chopped pork was decent!  Sides of Brunswick stew (average) and coleslaw (very good) were the right size.Other things mentioned was that the beans weren't good, the ribs were awesome, the veggie burger was inedible (but our guest was too nice to mention it to get it off the bill), the full meat plate hit the spot, and just about everything else was decent.One thing that was nice was when staff found out that it was one family member's birthday and we could not stay for dessert (too full and had to get the kids to bed) we were given some banana pudding to go on the house.About $160 not including tip for 9 which is not bad!"
2015-12-29,4.0,"New York, NY",Monapita Mediterranean Grill,"I came here upon good rating from the fellow yelpers.My husband and i ordered beef gyro with hummus and pita. Firstly, the meat was fantastically juicy and right off the grill. As for the rest, the flavors were alright and it didnt really outstand the gyros ive had before. It is an alright place if you havent had better. But I do recommend people come here to try it out for themselves and rate it. The environment is nice and small. Service is great."
2015-12-29,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Monapita Mediterranean Grill,"I was really looking forward to lunch here for the first time after a long morning of errands. I ordered the falafel pita to go and waited at their barstools up front while they made it. The two owners and their older mother were working. I noticed while waiting to place my order that their mother was chewing on and off while prepping the food. While I thought it odd that she'd be popping food in her mouth while prepping, I quickly dismissed it. That is, until I was waiting for my meal and saw her snag a piece off a pita they were making and pop it in her mouth - I saw them plop the falafel on and I prayed it wasn't mine. Thank goodness it was for someone two people in front of me.  Maybe I'm overreacting, but I'm sorry, in my opinion that is disgusting. The food was pretty good and the owners were friendly, so I won't completely cross it off the list, but if I go in again and see their mother working, you can bet I'll be watching my item preparation like a hawk."
2015-12-29,3.0,"Clayton, NC",Salt & Lime Cabo Grill,Sooo... I wanted to try something new & just so happened to stumble up on Salt & Lime Cabo Grill. Since I heard the Cabo Rolls were great we had to try them and yes they were delicious! We also had the wings which were off the chain!!!! We went during Happy Hour so our apps were $5 & their Dos Equis were $3. Craig the Bartender waited on us & he was Great! We've already planned to be here Thursday for Happy Hour (2 days away) Lol...
2015-12-29,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Bida Manda,"Great go-to restaurant in DTR! Firstly, the service is impeccable. Secondly, the food is wonderful. This visit, we ordered the wings (the server offered all 3 sauces on the side because one of our party has trouble with spicy food), summer rolls and lettuce wraps. All 3 were a hit. The entrees, pork belly soup, papaya salad, pork ribs and cashew chicken, were equally good. The exotic cocktails were hit or miss. Some, like their spin on a Manhattan and Pina Colada, were incredible. Others, I.e. Dancing with Yourself, were overwhelming. My only wish is that they bring back a bourbon cocktail from last year which was slightly sweet with a sugar cane garnish. Yum!"
2015-12-30,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Beasley’s Chicken & Honey,"I chose the chicken biscuit for lunch...not a fan of dark meat so I was disappointed when it arrived and wasn't chicken breast.  While it was a nice portion of chicken, only the crust was tasty to me (other than the pickled tomato, which was the most flavorable part of my meal). I asked the server about the slaw and she raved about its freshness and crispness.  I found it to have no real flavor...not something I'd choose again. The server convinced my lunch guest and me to share the mac and cheese....it too was low on flavor--more of sponge-like slab.  For all the emphasis on Southern fare, I found the food to be nothing special for a guy who was raised on real Southern food prepared by my Southern (Tar Heel) grandmothers and a Tar Heel mom.  I would not choose Beasley's again."
2015-12-30,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Aladdin’s Eatery,"Absolutely delightful! Service is great, Food was even better. Definitely recommend for lunch or dinner. Portions are large, so I recommend going with a big appetite!"
2015-12-30,4.0,"Holly Springs, NC",The Pit,"pretentious, trendy and overpriced. they've taken liberties with spicing southern classics they should not have, all in the name of attempting some sort of cost justifying gourmet twist. I don't know, but by the time they are done, the natural flavors are gone.  with all that being said, im glad I went. interesting food, interesting experience, decent service. nothing was BAD per se, just not a place to go back to. its certainly form over function. There are many hole in the wall ma and pa bbq/soul food places even in the triangle that are SO much better. you go here to feel fancy, I guess?"
2015-12-30,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Big Al’s BBQ,"Was watching house of cards, season one. (and Frank reintroduced me to the pleasure of barbecue during that season) in my search for the best barbeque in Raleigh NC Area i came across Big Al's. So Excellent !! you will not be disappointed. Trust."
2015-12-30,4.0,"Raleigh, NC",Poole’s Downtown Diner,"We got there around 5:15 as we were told if you miss the first seating at 5:30 you might have to wait, and sure enough at 5:30 we were brought to a nice table in the back. Hostesses and bartenders were all real welcoming and nice as it was our first time there and everything was new to us. Hubby had a beer while waiting and he seemed quite happy with it. We wound up eating a modified family style meal. We shared the pimento cheese and the chicken liver pate apps.  The pimento cheese was splendid, it had a wonderful kick and flavor. The liver pate was ok, not enough pate and too much fruit. Then we had two salads, the roasted beet was wonderful. We were fighting over the avocado, endive and grapefruit pieces. The harland creek salad had yummy brussel sprouts and pomegranate seeds.This was one of the best salads I've ever eaten. Then we were onto the mains. A few had chicken and said it was wonderful. I had the trout and the celery root puree that it was housed on was so good. Hubby had the rabbit confit, he loved every morsel. Others had the scallops, they had a great carmelization and the bed of leeks was so wonderfully buttery. We also share three sides, one was the brussel sprouts. I'm not sure what was done to them, but I would go back just for them. The twice cooked sweet potatoes were like heaven in a skin and the star of the night was the macaroni au gratin. I have to tell you I don't really like macaroni au gratin, but I think it is because I have never had it here. What delicious mouthfuls were the macaroni. Between superb service and wonderful food I do not know why we have never been here before as it opened in 2007. I would recommend not making the same mistake as we did and waiting 8 years to come to this wonderful restaurant."
2015-12-30,4.0,"Philadelphia, PA",Flying Saucer Draught Emporium,"This place is awesome. If you are visiting and staying at a hotel downtown, definitely stop by for great beers and vibe. Monday pint night is incredible, and Tuesday Trivia is fun too."
2015-12-30,3.5,"Holly Springs, NC",Wicked Taco Raleigh,"different that what you are probably used to!! corn tort tacos, not of the Mexican variety in all cases. good salsa bar, with some bottled hot sauces on the side - hey guys, take care of those sauces, most were empty and all were crusty!!! Fresh ingredients, a different take on tacos. a little bit expensive, but worth it for the interesting and fresh farm to table style food. definitely worth a try. careful, though, this is not an inexpensive ""fast food"" place."
2015-12-30,4.0,"Long Beach, CA",MoJoe’s Burger Joint,"Delicious food, and great service. Everything you want out of a burger joint. BACON!!!!!!"
2015-12-30,3.0,"Durham, NC",Piola,"Visited Piola for gnocchi night last night (29th of each month).  $15 dollars and they bring around different types of gnocchi to try family style - ie., the server would serve the whole table from a single bowl..  While our server was attentive, it seemed like the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing.  She would take our bowls, another server would come around with the next type of gnocchi and would have to return to the kitchen for serving bowls.  So, I give the gnocchi  4 stars and the service 3 stars.  Also, bear in mind, while there is a groupon coupon for Piola, you can't use it on gnocchi night even though there's nothing in the fine print that indicates this."
2015-12-30,5.0,"Raleigh, NC",Rise Biscuits & Donuts,"When we walked in, we walked through the line and stood a bit back, we were the only ones in line at the moment. A lady came out to tidy some things up but we weren't acknowledged with a hello from her or anyone behind the counter. There was a couple moments of awkward eye contact with the lady that had came out from behind the counter but no ""welcome"" or smile.  The chicken biscuit was good. Unfortunately, my girlfriends chicken wasn't cooked thoroughly and was pink inside and she didn't finish it, justly so. Will come back to try again, but a little disappointed as of now.Will update after we try again."
